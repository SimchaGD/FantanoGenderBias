worked before on previous projects in some capacity like on albums such as good to be home UCLA mad villainy the unseen previous to this album these three guys released an EP the burgundy EP sort of put out similar to how mad lib was releasing little singles and EPS with Freddie Gibbs prior to the release of pinata last year kind of testing the waters of that collaborative dynamic and now just like those preliminary Freddie Gibbs and mad lib EP as we are getting a full length blue meed mad lib record it is 15 tracks of muffled druggie left coast left field hip hop with a pretty impressive feature list we have people like Hodgy Beats of Odd Future Fame jimena Rose and Anderson PAC who are coming up as fantastic singers and their own right Stones Throw connects such as ala black we have Dame funk as well as mayer hawthorne other names you might know or remember like oh no Frank knit also Fonte and we have the metal finger man himself MF DOOM appearing on this thing too now considering all the names attached to this project I had no reason not to go into this thing excited however I was quickly reminded of why exactly some of the recent releases from meed and blue just didn't really hit that hard for me the most frustratingly awful thing about this album is without question the vocal mixing and they are stashed way behind a lot of the musical elements of the instrumentals on this record sadly this makes it really easy just to kind of let the songs fall into the background and just kind of let the beats fill up err and just focus simply on those but even if you wanted to hone in on what's being said lyrically it kind of becomes an impossibility because a lot of the subtle bits of language get eaten up in the beats listening to these songs again and again and again I just kind of found myself saying what huh speak up please what and what kind of makes this even more irritating is that some of the features as well are buried and and some of the other ones are actually up higher in the mix vocally it sounds like MF DOOM is actually much louder than a lot of the other people including the people whose names are on this project a lot of the other people on this album which was just weird why couldn't everyone have been that loud so that they could be audible as far as the instrumental side of this album goes Madlib does bring a lot of cool obscure fun little loops he is the loop digger and the percussion is super OnPoint a lot of the time but again the mixing sort of becomes an issue the bass is oppressive on this thing to the point where it is muffled and kind of hard to read sort of unintelligible and maybe it only feels weird because the bass is sort of one of the many things in these instrumentals that's drowning the vocals out maybe if the bass wasn't so loud one so in-your-face the vocals would be a little bit more readable but still there are tracks on here like burgundy whip where the bass does feel so muddled and just fat and loud and over compressed to the point where you can't even really read any sort of coherent groove out of what's going on in this song bass wise so even though the beats had this low fight charm that reminds me of Mad Libs lootpack days I think instrumentally this album is a little sloppy messy and kind of shoddy the mixing is just so off man it's just so flat it's so muddy dame funks appearance on the song peroxide where it seems like he's delivering these sort of Airy ethereal robotic talkbox vocals sounds awful and it doesn't really sound like it's it's any fault of his or anything like that with a better clearer just more robust mix I think it could have gone over better and on the few mums here where this al does deliver some vocals that are pretty audible it doesn't even wow me like on the song get money it's sort of ironic that one of the most intelligible tracks on this entire album has the least creative concept sometimes when a hook is presented with a guest singer such as when Aloe Blacc appears on the record his singing along with these chipmunks sample vocals just does not sound that great again it's another very muddy weakly performed moment on this record this album to me just sounds like a super weak demo tape yeah just kind of one big sloppy disappointing rap demo just really let down by this thing unfortunately I can't even say there was anything on this record that I really loved I was really indifferent toward much of what was here and when I wasn't feeling that way I was just frustrated by the awful vocal mixing and just the general sound and production of this thing unfortunately it's just such a weird novice and I guess unnecessary thing to to really be holding this album back as much as it does especially given the reputation of the names on this project and yet the the sound and the mixing issues on this thing persists from one track to another to the point where I don't even really feel like I can properly evaluate things like the lyrical quality of this thing I don't know I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this transition have you given this record to listen if you have are you as pink as me I'm pretty pink right now and if you have given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it was the vocal mixing not really that big of a deal for you and why Anthony Fantino meed blue Madlib forever 
c4ehpj0Yk9E,can't you say something nice say something nice in the review means that a guy tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new igloo ghost EP Chinese New Year igloo ghost is the pseudonym of one UK producer who right here is making his brain feeder Records label debut with this EP and there's kind of a weird story behind the CP in a way it's supposed to tell the tale of a gelatinous hat-wearing worm as he travels through all of these wormholes however this narrative isn't really something you're confronted with unless you actually go looking for it a bit of a distraction from the music itself in a way though that same insane weird out there creativity that went into that backstory for this EP actually carries over into the music itself here and with that narrative in mind I could see how this would be the soundtrack to that on the four tracks of the CPU we'll find a wild mesh of electronic and popular music styles ranging from hip-hop to wonky a bit of IDM EDM break beats UK bass and maybe a splash like little spritz a vapor wave as well as a series of very odd jittery vocal and it's all over the place and some really visceral hard-hitting beats and percussion really intense synth players now of course with this project being on brain feeder records it's very clear that there is a Flying Lotus influence on here but igloo ghosts most definitely pushes that inspiration into another dimension which I'm sure he traveled to with a black hole where he ended up meeting that gelatinous worm that is featured on the cover here the music on this record it's bright it's playful it's odd in a way reminds me of rusty or maybe even Hudson Mohawke but it's far too whacked out and strange warrant any play in the club I mean I think even less palatable in a club context than what the people over at PC music are doing but yet it kind of has a similar fun-loving oddity quality to it the songs on this thing are like three to five minutes each but still within that short span of time igloo ghost packs in a lot I love the very rubbery and bouncy kick drums and shimmering synthesizers on the intro track here which feature all of these kind of melodic and percussive freak outs every few bars a lot of the songs on here are pretty glitchy and there are all these just nutty insane disorienting vocal edits in the left and right channels the pitched vocals the chipmunk vocals on the next track man in tachi yusan Chet they're incredibly strange and the grooves and the since on this track are hilarious and irresistible really fun loving and danceable but also disorienting a lot like the previous track in a way the beats the percussion on this thing kind of reminds me of Sophie a bit but without a lot of the weird gimmicky sounds that typically come with PC music tuned there's a strange rap verse at the very end of this track - which sounds like it's coming from some kind of weird alternate dimension where maybe there's a whole world of music that sounds exactly like this it sounds like something out of wacky land which you may be familiar with if you're a kind of into the Warner Brothers cartoon universe gogo dodo comes from there I feel old having to explain this following this track things get a bit smoother a bit prettier on the song gold the coat where there are actually some very beautiful vocal samples which are harmonized very nicely throughout the track the beats stay visceral but the melodies are very hypnotic and very serene and the breakdown in the second half of this track is actually awesome really got my whole body moving and the last track on here I think is maybe the most inconspicuous out of all of them maybe I need to listen to it a little bit more but it didn't seem as distinct or is out there as the previous songs but still it's a very bustling incredibly busy track even with it laying up on the weird a bit it's still comparatively strange to a lot of the wonky music that had come out a few years ago and and has sort of I don't know died as far as a trend unfortunately not completely though obviously but I just feel like there was a span of time shortly after the release of Kozma grandma and a lot of those initial brain feeder releases where it seems like everybody was trying to get their wonky purple sounds psychedelic off-kilter beat tape up on a band camp and SoundCloud and all that and again it certainly sounds like igloo ghost is pulling a lot of inspiration from that time period but again doing something very odd and very fun and and very playful with it as experimental as this little EP is so many parts on this thing had me smiling because I think all the musical tricks and the colorful kaleidoscopic layers of a very synthetic sound on here are very fun this thing is essentially just interdimensional ear candy and I can't wait to hear more this is definitely going to be one of my favorite EPS of the year I'm feeling he liked a decent eight on this thing hey hey hey this epic got an eight hey hey this got an eight eight position have you given this record of listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it yeah any fans here now puppy forever 
eq5naPgB3k8,all the new reviews are our super negative that'd be me hey everybody bad the name Boitano here the Internet's busiest music person and it's time for a review of the new foxing record dealer these guys are a st. Louis rock band fusing elements of emo indie rock and a bit of post rock as well this is their second full-length album here they are coming off of their relatively successful commercial debut album of which there were numerous positive reviews I got a lot of recommendations to check that album out last year saying it was amazing and it was really emotional and really powerful so given those recommendations and the fact that I know the band mashes together these particular genres I went into this thing expecting a lot of crescendos a lot of beautiful instrumentation and that's basically what I got here and and on paper that's all well and good I mean I heard the world is a beautiful place mashed together a lot of those same elements earlier this year and I thought it was great but foxing does it in a very different way in in such a way where it resulted in one of my least favorite listening experiences of this year yeah I'm not beating around the bush here I didn't like this not at all and I think it comes down to a handful of major aspects one the vocals they whine they whimper and they moan through this entire album when they aren't mumbling incoherently trying to convey this soul-sucking lack of emotion they're reaching into their upper range into this really kind of nasal delivery that has me thinking the band believes that they're the next Radiohead or cigarettes the singing is boyish and it left no impression on me whatsoever especially emotionally and emotion is all the band really seems to be conveying here because the music is really nothing to write home about it consists of mostly very stashed away in the back drumbeats some twinkling basic guitar Peggy OH and one cliche post rock crescendo after another the band essentially taking advantage of the discovery many forgotten groups made five to ten years ago that you essentially don't really need to put that much effort into songwriting as long as you can hand your audience instrumentation that they think is beautiful and emotionally stirring just by kind of going through this dynamic grow high or loud oh it's booming Oh fall fall soft get quiet it's dramatic wash it rinse it repeat it watch it rinse it repeat it it doesn't really matter what the court progressions are because the chord progressions are so bland and uninteresting and so run-of-the-mill that they don't really matter it's all about these bland rushes of guitars and arranged instrumentation which if we were going to be honest with ourselves tons and tons of post rock bands throughout the 2000s and the 90s did it better so on this thing we have weak vocals painfully rudimentary instrumentals and nothing in sight in terms of a compelling or memorable song this album does absolutely nothing for me and the band must be releasing this record assuming that the people listening have no clue these bands are who they so obviously borrow from in a really cheap way now there were a few moments that stood out to me on this record though a couple these string sections on track six but these string sections on track six which goes in a more instrumental direction we're actually pretty powerful once you just take the vocals out of the equation and you just kind of really rely on those string arrangements the the music is quite nice the vocals on Ifill actually struck me as impassioned and this is the only song on the record that actually delivered a crescendo that I thought was legitimately powerful and explosive it was a crescendo that really had that emotional roller-coaster ride feel that you look for in a rock crescendo of this style and the shout ear approach that the vocals took on glass coughs I can't say I loved it but it was definitely a better change of pace from what's typically vocally on a majority of these tracks you know this this record it's most cardinal sin is that it's generic it really as nothing that interesting or distinct going on about it but it is so generic and so lacking and exciting ideas that it's painful and it's the kind of pain that slowly draws more and more intense as the album continues on kind of like I'm slowly being pulled apart on a torture rack or something so I mean I'm really feeling like a light too decent three on this thing transition have you given this record of listen if you have you probably liked it more than me didn't you that's fine that's cool there reason to sweat a difference of opinions son forever 
DN7WJIVXX-M,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new kirk knight album late night special kirk night is a new york rapper producer bro era affiliate beast cost and now here is with this new full-length album which is pretty much just dropped out of nowhere as some of you may know kirk did show quite a bit of promise on that last pro era tape peep the pro clips and the question is has that promise developed into a good solid enjoyable full-length album well this project does have 12 tracks on it which i think is a good move doesn't really overstay its welcome or anything like that seems kirk wants to make a good impression with this few tracks as possible and as far as the instrumental vibe of this album much like other members of pro era especially Joey badass Kirk sort of channels that 90s boom bap jazz rap vibe there are some great loops and samples throughout this thing I like the dreamy piano loop on the song five minutes with Joey badass the very eerie twang melody on the song broke land it's pretty fantastic and sets a very dark tone for that song and the more modern approach on the song nighttime as well as a few other tracks here is nice as well not only are there rattling trap style high hats on this thing but these synthesizers are super eerie super dark the cords are heavy and sound like something out of a John Carpenter soundtrack and the instrumental backing up the song I know with Mick jankins on it doesn't sound too unlike something that would have landed on Jenkins mixtape the waters especially since the beat sounds so spacious and has those high hats just firing off like an automatic machine gun there's some beats here they have a more smooth melodic approach on the song down there's kind of a weird percussive off-kilter piece of noise that that protrudes throughout the track making it just have a really weird groove to it I have a lot of praise for the production on this them not only because the production is good but it's versatile as well but I think this album is way more versatile as far as the beats go and just not versatile enough and not impressive enough on the lyrical end of things not that Kirk is a terrible rapper I think he has the baseline attributes that a good rapper should have I mean he's got some decent bars he's got flow and quite a few of the songs on this record are actually topical and focused in some kind of way but I think there are a few things about his rapping that kind of holds this record back a little bit for one his incredibly youthful voice which doesn't really have that much presence or weight to it which I think makes songs like Brooklyn really hard to sell because he is kind of going aggressive on this track but that aggression for me isn't really felt that hook though his monstrous where he layers all the vocals on top of each other Brooklyn and he doesn't exactly start the record off with a blast either on the song start running which essentially kind of puts the introduction of this album in a something that sounds like a dream sequence the blissful heaven is real doesn't exactly put any teeth on this record either I think as somebody who's really trying to establish himself as a solo artist within this you know kind of Pro era context he needs to come through with something just a little more hard-hitting and definitive not these sort of light introspective tracks that are sort of breezy and kind of forgettable on this very track Kirk drops lines like give me everything I need to release the beast and I think the issue is is that on this record I don't think the beast really gets released or if he is the release isn't really that exciting at this point on this album Kirk kind of reminds me of where Joey badass was a handful of projects ago somebody who had a lot of talent and had some great tracks under his belt but I think really was yet to define himself as an artist and was really yet to put together a solo project that was just solid and fantastic from beginning to end again Kirk has these baseline attributes that a good rapper should have but I think he's yet to really build and think definitive on top of those attributes which i think is shown in the fact that his guests consistently steal the spotlight from him on this record especially since he puts a lot of them first on these tracks with the exception of no-name gypsy who when she comes through she's a very nice change of pace as well on this album because Kirk's near monotone delivery a lot of the time though not to say his more aggressive voice really again sells me on these songs combined with the lack of quotables on these tracks as well as a lack of of just serious attitude again I think holds this record back and then there the moments on this record where he's singing and he's worse off as a singer than he is a rapper thankfully he passed the singing off to a guest feature the mind on the song the future and that actually goes over very well I think Kirk has a sharp ear when it comes to instrumentals and and when he's working with other artists I think he gets some good hooks together and this is actually one of the tracks on this record where Kirk's delivery actually strikes me as is passionate so definitely a high point on this album here but that's just the exception in the vast majority of these tracks which I think are kind of bland and a little middle-of-the-road I'm feeling a strong 5 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Kirk Knight forever

we go that is nice how would how would you like to be introduced for this interview I don't know what type of I guess persona or whatever you want to kind of keep up for dirt for this thing well I'm s I just I mean whatever reason you felt like you had interested in talking to me you just say whatever you want well I just thought you'd be an interesting guest considering the the whole condon ass thing that just occurred and we can just kind of talk music industry stuff and search I know you're pretty passionate about and knowledgeable on and yeah I mean I wouldn't want I wouldn't want to overstate or oversell the knowledgeable side because basically what's been happening for the last 10 years is people people who are pissed off and aren't happy kind of feed me stuff and you know I don't reveal where I get information from but at the same time it's like it's not just me you know people love to think that I'm like the most bitter guy and Chris hots pitchforks harshest critic it's like dude no I'm not I haven't even worked there in ten fucking years but I'm I'm on my own I'm not trying to write for a living there's lots of people trying to write for a living who are literally fucked over by this and by other things that pitchforks done and they can't say anything because they're blackballed well it kind of sounds like okay so while you may not be their harshest critic it's it would seem that you're their harshest critic just because the fact that you sang anything about them doesn't really affect your your daily life doesn't affect your personal life is in effect you know what you're doing for for work and and on top of that I think a lot of people tend to put a little bit more weight on some of what you're saying because of your long-standing history with the with the website well so yeah I start I you know Ryan Ryan and Brent D curse Enzo and a couple of the people had been Brent had his own site Ryan was just doing his own thing this is like 96 97 99 and that's when I'm out of school and I'm starting to try to find zine so right for like Jessica hoppers Chris Ryan hit it or quit it you know these are people who've gone on to to make media and writing and editing they're their livelihood yeah and you know back then we were all just like Craig Finn was writing for hit or quit it you know back lifter puller was like just coming together and so yeah I had the first stretch I did from like 99201 and then I wrote this really harsh review of this completely shitty emo band called shiner uh-huh to be fair i they'd kilo with a record after the one i trashed called the egg is like orange and white of course because it was an emo record yeah lots excited it kind of sounds like a predecessor to the Twitter egg avatar it is if you look on the back of it they're probably like they're probably figured out the way they can get a couple bucks off that actually yeah yeah they they were just this like real Cornie grunge band that you know because J Robbins produced them they thought they were gonna be you know totally slotted right in on indie celebrity and they're on desoto you know but yeah I ripped them on this record and then the distributor got all bullshit and was like you know we're not gonna service you anymore this is fuckin bullshit this is totally like we're not here for your amusement blah blah you don't get our product anymore and this is right at the same time that another writer got us in trouble with merge for printing something from Britain Yule from spoon he said something in an interview and right before he said it he said this is off the record sorry no he did not say this totally backwards Brit Daniel didn't say this is off the record he reached over and turned off the interviewers cassette player that doesn't it's no journalistic value it means nothing he just reached across the table and turned off his tape player and said something and then turned it back on well we reported that and merge got totally pissed and we said look you're your subject the interviewer never received a request to go off the record mm-hmm do you know and merge was like don't even think about playing that game you're nothing you're nobody so these two things happen and Ryan was like well we're gonna they're gonna blow us up so you know he's shit can me or whatever but then like after a year and a half it was like uh you know that was stupid you know I like Chris you're a good writer blah blah and that was when I came back and really did the most of the work from like it was like January or February 2002 until the end of 2000 right before 2005 so you know you're talking about like five of God like going 20 years total work so it's like a quarter of the life of the thing I've been directly involved in contributing to it so and those are some pretty formative years that's a for the website that's the thing so you add the fact that I'm there when it's making its name right before it gets representation from WME before Marc Geiger comes in before you get the write-up in Time magazine in 2007 yeah I'm there in those early years and I'm scrubbing with everybody and we had it's all the time you know like bretons always he always had this like a total bug up his ass about me because I was a good writer and I knew a shitload about music and so was he and so did he and he was kind of like he wanted to be number one you know so we always had like a kind of a number one in terms of making the website number one no no he always wanted to be like the super writer like okay he didn't want to be President you know chief operating officer or any of that bullshit or editor editor he wanted to be you know the the Lester Bangs the he wanted that rep okay yeah and that's why he wrote the way he did and he was he was fucking great at it and I was never that kind of writer it was a totally different trip but because I was like very like theory based and and in political you know social with all my stuff I think that you know Brent and I were both going down two very different paths but we were we were really getting a lot of reaction hmm for different reasons so so as I was saying I mean it sounds like these are sort of really formative years for the website where pitchfork is is is really trying to not only make a name for itself but you guys are kind of in the midst of a really interesting sort of social experiment at the same time simultaneously you know because there's not really a sort of a lot of websites out there like this right now with with quite the voice that pitchfork was trying to uh to sculpt am i right yeah we stayed all it was its they we stayed all comers right so nobody I mean I don't know how far you go back with this but when when pitchforks starting up you know you've got a hundred scenes western homes yot zine pillow fight drawer be these are names that are never going to be remembered by anybody except the people who were you know their peers mm-hmm and there were a lot of these sites that were way fuckin better looking and and slicker than pitchfork but I had said this in the the video and now podcast I put up about William Basinski is the disintegration loops Bryan figured out before anybody that you had to have the content was the thing content was king you know it wasn't just the slick look no and pitchfork I thought the layout was always fucking terrible dude yeah until like you know they actually hired some some real people to do this latest one that's been in place for I don't know how many years now but you know they just got fucked by Conde so redesign yeah yeah okay well what you're talking about all of these websites that pitchfork was competing with but you're referring to them as eenz but I mean they really were websites exactly so they were webzines but al did a lot of these sites start paper at some point was this basically this competition this kind of community that you guys were functioning and was this as a result of a lot of people who might have been involved with zena's prior to this internet age kind of realizing okay you know this internet thing sounds like a great bandwagon to kind of jump on let's try to evolve into this I'd say a hundred percent no these were people who had been zine fans but you know yes I grew up reading the scenes and Brian DIF took to the internet to sort of do their own version of it yeah and a lot of the people who contributed you know we're jumping off of having written for zine zand whatever you had regional big scenes like hit it or quit it in Chicago yeah and you know when the webzines were coming out they were totally independent voices and that in itself made it hard for it to kind of shake out because pack back then the being the first big big webzine was buddy head yes okay yeah I recall them I've had a few back and forth with some of the people over there what Travis yes Travis who I think has broken my balls on several occasions well everybody tries to break your balls but you can't because you're out there every day it's just like dude it's exactly like pitchfork you don't go away you know that content is what matters and that's you know whether or not you have a video that gets five thousand hits or one that gets 1.6 million you just have to keep doing it and that was why pitchfork ended up winning the whole thing sure so so when you say content are you talking about pitchfork kind of focusing on the quality of the content consistency of the content or just both it was consistency initially yeah it was like he keep it we had I remember this one time we had this big problem where like everybody flaked just everybody was hungover or shit the bed and there was one day we were like dude I don't even think we have fucking 4 reviews we can run let's just I was like well wait Ryan what if we do what if we say races uki died so Rey Suzuki was the Alan Smithee the pen name that everybody used when they wrote something really offensive on pitchfork okay yeah I'll just out that so if you go back and find anything that races uki ever wrote it's it's a pen name for sam channel while other people everett ryan used it and so i was like well let's just hide receive the fucking image of this probably somewhere on a hard drive ID we did this whole like funeral on the like the site went black and it said ray suzuki you know 1982 to 19 2001 or something because we were we we had days where literally were like i don't think we're gonna be opening the store today and ryan was like that can't happen ever find something some piece of shit you wrote four years ago just something we can't not put up the site every day yeah even though the readership was nowhere near you know what i mean his drive was like that's the thing that we can never we can't fall down there sure i kind of have that that that same urge as well yeah you totally do and that's you know that's there's a major fucking parallel between what you're doing and what he did you're doing it on youtube he did it on the web there's no exaggeration there's no myth-making or convenience in that analogy it's a legit analogy yeah okay so so you're talking about this this consistency of just always putting out material you're talking about these competitors who might have looked slicker than pitchfork at the time during the late 90s the early 2000s were they taking days off or they just not dropping material on some days and and and the fact that they weren't interacting with their their their viewer base with their reader basis is that eventually what kind of made pitchfork went out down the road yep absolutely it was it was the tortoise and the hare and it was you know you'd like people you'd like and you'd check him every so often but what became apparent was that pitchfork was like the CNN of the scene and you were never gonna not get something when you went there and and so all these other sites everybody had day jobs everybody was going to shows or bands and do another shit and it was like this is it's not like you make any money and it's like there were no web match tricks back then you didn't even know who was reading your shit there were no web boards really god oh it's I don't remember web boards being a thing even until like 2002 ish something you know so yeah yeah well I remember web boards really coming up just when I had entered college so that would that would be around that time like 2002 2003 in terms of like you know a supremely relevant place for music fans to go to yeah and it I mean if you don't even have web boards you just have no way of knowing who is reading your stuff and it is so fucking hard to get up every day and feel like yeah I should totally dedicate six fucking hours to putting up this stuff and get two hours of sleep and go to my fucking bullshit job like but well we all did it I did it for a couple of years and and you know obviously Ryan did it for longer than anybody it's uh that's what it took and it you know the audience was gonna end up being there and it was a question of who was gonna be there to feed the audience and and he never let up hmm okay so so obviously there's a point at which you guys are always putting up something even if it's not up to a certain standard or or whatever oh yeah no no there's not gonna be a Gawker article about the stuff from 2002 that doesn't get cut over to Condes servers dude yeah absolutely oh yeah so so you're saying that stuff is getting all trashed right now there's I guess there's a digital internet fire right now and it's all kind of rotting away in it you know I don't know what's gonna happen but I know they have absolutely no basis to negotiate with anyone for transitioning ownership of the content for of pitchfork to a new owner as a digital asset and and no other authors that I know of have publicly gone out and said yeah that's not okay do you want to pay me for that but they're all entitled to do that and they really should mm-hmm okay um so so there's this point in time where pitchforks just you know putting up anything just to very smartly keep the audience engaged but you know you're talking about down the road sort of becoming the CNN to the scene I imagine over the course of that process of that development there had to have been some kind of standards or something implemented or else you know the the site never would have made it to that point correct no I mean I mean it has to be like some kind of standard in terms of consistency because people are at least like expecting something to be there when they get to the site yeah yeah exactly how or when I guess is sort of this schedule or this you know that these standards implemented so that the site is kind of this well-oiled machine that's always doing something right so okay so that the transformative moment the transformative moment there if pitchfork ends up you know if anybody ever writes the book on pitchfork the transformational moment was when pitchfork broke the news that Thom Yorke and PJ Harvey were working on a song together we had that before anybody else it was the first time we had a scoop and I don't even remember how he got it it was like some friend working at a fucking PR firm legging for pitchfork saying you should break it here it'll look really credible whatever but up until that point there was never a whiff of exclusivity about anything we did and the news section would get updated like when there was news well there's no well you're talking about there's not even a whiff of exclusivity to anything that you did but simultaneously this person in PR saw some kind of authenticity in what you were doing and and that couldn't have been the case if unless you know there was an audience who felt that pitch work was very off very authentic kind of webzine or you know at least more authentic than its competitors in some kind of way well yeah I say PR but you know what that might have been somebody who was working at a record label I don't remember that clearly I wasn't I never edited or touched a news site that was like Kristin sage Rahman and Catherine Lewis and a lot of other people worked on the news site but for all the people that worked on the news site we never focused on it until Ryan started saying like we this is the most important part of the site we have to keep the news stuff going all the time and it was brutal because we didn't have relationships and the big problem along all this point at which pitchforks becoming established is nobody trusted the internet yet so no nobody believed that it was nobody believed any of the numbers nobody was advertising on it you didn't have you know any imprimatur as a brand yeah until you know WME artist management mark geiger these people come in and bless you and you get people like Questlove dropping your name in an interview until you're you're christened and coronated by existing celebrity you know what I'm saying it's a battle to get anything out of anybody no I definitely understand that I mean not that you know sort of Danny Brown what's up yeah no I mean there's there have been numerous instances you know and and it's and I don't know if you know this is just because I'm kind of in the thick of it and and um you know I don't have the same view that other people do of it especially someone like you who's been in the industry you know longer or at least you know has been in it a little bit you know kind of back in the day you know I almost feel as if that sort of stuff maybe doesn't pull the attention toward me that it could because everything is just such an onslaught right now on the Internet yeah you know it's it just kind of seems like endorsements are just the name of the game and everybody's getting endorsed in every direction all day no no question and also you don't run yourself like a fucking you know brand you don't have I mean I don't I don't know what you have and I don't know you know if you're signed up with any artist management but the way that you've been doing stuff doesn't lend itself to strategic you know campaigns whether they're whether they're publicity campaigns or it's music release campaigns whatever it is the way you work is so non-stop that it's not like there's a package deal to you know to get your your brand solidified or whatever you're just doing it all the time so they don't have any effectiveness there yeah I mean I guess the the the most I guess I kind of think of my brand in inter in those sorts of terms is when I guess an album is coming out that I really feel like you know I'm anticipating and I really need to review it not only for the fact that I'm curious about as a music fan but also because reviewing it or not reviewing it is going to impact the the relevancy of of my website you know it's and it really has I'm sure in some way it does have some kind of impact in terms of whether or not the review is positive or negative but I know that just not reviewing it isn't an option you know well this is the Taylor Swift problem that pitchforks had yeah there has been he basically if Ryan doesn't think something is cool or he thinks it's at a level that's wrong for his audience this has been the thing that has stayed the longest this subjective well we wouldn't write up Janet Jackson we wouldn't write up you know there's this popped amidst raucous problem it's always yeah it's kind of a balance it's always been there with pitchfork and the fact that they didn't review any a Taylor Swift stuff is just like a huge fuckup it's this old mentality of indie it's like dude we knew that was dead so long ago yeah I mean simultaneously I mean I have to kind of admit I'm in the same boat I totally ignored Taylor Swift's last full-length LP I mean I guess I am planning on reviewing the new Adele record when when that drops that's fucking crazy how can you review one and not the other it's it's not even you know it's it's not even that I feel justified in not reviewing the Taylor Swift record I mean it's something that if I could go back in time I probably would do it at this point and honestly I mean you know the whole raucous sort of thing I guess is an ideology that I kind of slipped into when I got into punk rock music in high school and it's something that I've been solely kind of growing out of as an adult and while I still appreciate a lot of underground stuff and a lot of experimental rock you know I've sort of come to understand and and and sort of feel that not only for my well-being as you somebody who owns a business but also as a music fan you know the this pop stuff this chart-topping stuff is you know you can't argue that it's always just as good or it's always just as entertaining as the underground stuff I mean you know the underground stuff and get pretty awful as well but I guess it's just as deserving of critical assessment and that's the underground stuff yeah but I don't you know the distinction I always make when I talk about this is effort so there was effort required to even get a fucking record out when you had physical media and that's the whole punk rock you know hardcore 7-inch things going back to the late 80s all the way through the 90s whether it's like you know you know quiet shuffle e footed you know sad boy indie pop or it's you know fucking roughneck hardcore bands it you're nobody's doing it for you and so now that music is media in the same way as a tweet there's no effort required it's just a question of whether or not you hit it you have the same platforms as everybody else hmm so you know yes Taylor Swift is like you know mainstream corporate celebrity management and that's totally fucked up but at the same time if you make a really good record it can go through the exact same channels to just as many people you're just not going to be playing you know the fucking mega tours and and doing you know celebrity endorsement campaigns with makeup you know or whatever sure you may not make as much money and you may not have as many opportunities but the audience is just as accessible to you through almost the same channels I mean Taylor Swift's not on Spotify right yeah I can be unspotted I so I got her there they have 75 million fucking listeners well that's true you can be on Spotify and like a thousand of them are ever gonna listen to my shit because it just isn't it's not appealing on that level but that's what I'm saying like the potential to confront the same sized audience is there for anybody yeah so the indie thing is dead it is dead it's been dead but now it's like incontestably totally fucking 9,000 feet under cement gone yeah I mean I kind of feel like that's unfortunately solidified in so many ways I mean I feel like Indy in terms of what's in the is Bandcamp that's Indy well I mean here's the thing I mean I think Indy in terms of I guess kind of a lifestyle or I guess a I don't know I guess you would call a functionality style for a band as we knew it in the 90s I mean do you think it's truly dead or do you think it's sort of simply evolved you know I mean I think I think the tools are have kind of changed you know I think it's completely dead because you don't have to do anything to get your music heard except promote it you have your name captive audience as anyone else when when you're putting out a 7-inch and you live in some fucking shithole in Somerville or you know real Brooklyn back when you know before like anything had happened and it was really actually fucked up and scary you know you're going to some show and there's no internet coverage nobody's there's no it was such a pain in the ass I was in York during the whole strokes Interpol period and you know pitchforks in Chicago and it's a big fucking problem and I'm screaming at Ryan like dude because I start a bureau here do you know what a bureau is like we need to get a bureau started we didn't have people on the fucking crown we need to be promoting shows in New York this is like 2005 when I'm quitting when cmj of that year and it was a big problem I was like you got you got to have people on the ground here yeah because there's a music scene worth covering well and also there was this whole like you know che things Second City problem you might as well have been based in Boston you know sure yeah let's review 12 rods but not you know go get somebody to interview The Strokes face to face that's really good play yeah and that was the problem it was just like that that second city indie you know go to the show my friends band we didn't know there was no metrics to understand how nationally big pitchfork was it was fucking huge with no evidence hmm and I was screaming it at people and they were like dude you're so full of shit like there's a there's a big ilm thread from way back where I'm such a fucking dick but it's like 2003 and I'm like dude pitchforks bigger than spin deal with it and people who like hear such a fucking psycho you're so crazy but it was true hmm I mean spin at that time was going into the full whole fucking you know panic at the disco period where they just bit so hard on makeup Fall Out Boy emo crap I don't know it there were so many different things happening at once in terms of the destruction and upheaval that was just it was so crazy and there was nothing to point to to be like this is what reality looks like it was just all anxiety was all anxiousness anxiety nerves insecurity people afraid of losing their jobs one week you come in and you know your cover is the best thing that's come out in the last year on spin it you're so happy and then the next issue comes out and it's like you're fired yeah it was fucking nuts cuz no but nobody had anything definitive to point to okay so you you've just brought up so much I'm not asking you to respond to this but I'm just gonna say I can kind of see how starting in a city like Chicago you know and doing what you guys were doing would have you know sort of solidified you know in pitchfork you know the kind of pro underdog kind of mentality that the site has you know sort of shopped around for such a long time and and simultaneously I think that while you know you say that at this point India's dead and you know while you were kind of working at the site during that period it was dying you know it was definitely on its last breath in a sense I could definitely see how kind of sticking to those guns at least a little bit kind of ended up saving the website from kind of going down that same road that spin did you know endorsing bands like Panic at the Disco in the way that they did or you know that's saying are you saying that you know kind of covering those bands would have been okay just as long as the reviews ended up negative or something no no it would have been a problem and it was good that pitchfork stayed away from that whole thing because it was run by big labels and it was the it was a big label old music industry push and it's what killed buddy head because buddy head was too close to LA and so you know Travis is out there and he's like oh dude I'm fuckin with fred durst bro i minutes I'm you know I'm going to so many fucking clubs dude I got his phone number you guys are a little fucking nobodies I'm hooked and then it was like oh shit you just burned a bridge you didn't even have dude like nobody in LA was gonna fuckin fund you you were cut such a fuckin mess so you know he just that guys ego fucked himself so hard like oh it was such a it was really sad cuz he was brilliant and but the site just became Howard Stern's backpack so fast it just became a nightmare of like scenester ball washing and it was just garbage tell me if you know you think I'm totally wrong in this but I mean I guess India it in a sense it's dead but I think it's dead because it kind of lost its its independence I think in some kind of sense it's still there but I think the the issue of sort of assuming it it has all the same characteristics that it used to is that you know really what what's going on is sort of like what you were saying you know if you put up a record it's kind of in that same airspace that you know Taylor Swift's new record is I think the issue with Indy is that you know really it's just kind of mixed in with everything else now everything is mixed the fuck together and there's really kind of no cultural or social boundaries separating all of it you know all of it anymore you know it's it's it's kind of interesting because you know maybe my music tastes and my sensibilities you might find them a little odd because I'm a bit younger than you but the people who view my videos who are younger than me and and not that I think it's totally weird because I've kind of grown into this sensibility but but as a kid you know I wasn't listening to both Death Grips and Lady Gaga and and that's not even something I would have thought to do if you know those artists had come out when I was younger you know but however some of these kids hit me up and they show me their last FM's and they listen to everything from fucking napalm death to Belen Sebastian to the to carly rae jepsen record or some shit right so that's that's syncretism and the syncretism thing is that's infected kids because there's a there's an addiction in saying I am totally immune to categorization I am so comfortable crossing all lines and that was really what popped em ism was about because of the dominance you know the dominant aesthetic of Indy and the hangover from Indy and Godspeed you black Emperor and all this fucking nonsense you know like that whole pretentious you know period you know it was like what if I just listened to you know fucking Paula Abdul is that a problem sure so you know but the other thought I have about that is so yeah you have the indie kids the kids who that's right when I think of indie kids I think of kids who are sort of intellectually into music that to me is what India is about and and and it no longer means finding obscure sacrosanct holy records I got you know L AM F and and nobody else has it in my town or what you know I have the père ubu I have dub housing before they were before they released the the data panic in the Year Zero box set nobody had ever heard para booboo for like ten fucking years nobody had heard any of those first records and you know I had a buddy who was down in New York and he's at all the you know crazy you know other music and whatever and he's getting those records but they're the only people on the planet who were able to get vinyl of new picnic time and dub housing or whatever so that that kind of you know librarian obsessive thing was part of it but what I wanted to say in a completely different direction but it's relevant is and it's surprising for me to bring it up but where is this whole modern problem of the collapse of credibility and authenticity felt more than in rap and hip hop because oh you're a brave rapper you're fuckin you know you're coming out of the gate with this corny fuckin synth wash bullshit for the club and you're basically a Drivetime fuckin bumper-kart for you know going to a show after and living this fake-ass fuckin advertised bullshit lifestyle lifestyle rappers are fucking huge problem you know what happened nobody fucking heard that Diamond Dogs record dude mm-hmm it's ancient as shit and I sound like a fucking stand to bring it up but I can love that record and those dudes were singing about shit like having to get a job with their white voice hmm that's a legit cultural you know sentiment if you're a young black person that's frustrating as shit but nobody's talkin to what comes out and fuckin rap now dude it's like dude it's not it's not 1997 anymore what the fuck are you guys talking about so are you saying that hip-hop is in need of the same kind of authenticity check as indie is or are you saying that indie is lacking the kind of authenticity checks the hip-hop somehow has because no I'm saying hip-hop has been more destroyed by the absolute leveling of the playing field and the accessibility to you know broad massive captive audiences hip-hop has been hurt so much worse because you know local scenes the local scenes are just destroyed because all you need is one established guy to tap you on the fucking shoulder and you're in the stratosphere in ten seconds you're a celebrity rapper sure why I think that's for a multitude of reasons and I think that's part of the reason that hip-hop is a sort of replacing rock and roll in a lot of senses I mean so many interesting and and so many genre changing things all happening at once at the end of 2010 I mean you've essentially got the end of the bling era you know you have Kanye's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy which brought tons of you know once not rap listeners into the fold you have the internet sort of influencing you know and also access to technology influencing a lot of young rappers has just put their stuff up online rather than playing the label game and you have tons of people just sort of listening to and putting out really alternative shit that on the democratized internet is sort of floating to the top and as a result just all of these really rapid changes are occurring all at once so so have you ever checked out black hearts that collective in Denver now I haven't okay so there's this guy Yanis Jonas Abram I've never met this guy we've only talked through Twitter but you know he was in this like fucking really cool you know chopped it's not chopped and screwed it's it's it's way more goth and and in touch with with femininity and in a way like so black hearts was around and doing stuff and like you know you know spooky black that kid yeah I do yeah right so spooky black is more like a move style whatever appreciation for just like suburban you know nihilism or something that kids whole deal I fucking love that first record I was going crazy for it two years ago or whatever but you know these guys are out in Denver and these guys are lifer hip-hop got they know hip hop inside and fucking out it's in their blood yeah and they've had opportunities they've had all this like you know people sniffing around them and I think you know this is going out on his own he's kind of been in touch with me recently after a dry spell but I loved their fucking music because it spoke to this sense of like it's still a struggle like it's not like it's hard for hip-hop to get made or noticed or appreciated it it's not like it's invalid as a genre and operating in darkness we're not but the way I want to do it nobody cares about the way I want to do it but I believe in the way I want to do it and I know I have fans who believe in the way I want to do it yeah and and so that's sort of what I'm saying like these guys have done some really fucking cool beautiful shit and and I the stuff that I liked the most of the that I heard and it's been shared by them and put out or whatever that wasn't necessarily even their favorite material but I responded to it crazy like rapidly and I was like oh my fucking god this is like you know everybody gave Salem so much shit for you know basically doing like you know audio blackface you know you can make that argument fine I don't agree with it but these guys were in that same kind of whatever said about which house they were in they were all upfront about goth he wore Bauhaus t-shirts and he's like yeah I fucking love all this shit and hip hop is my life and when you see him when you see interviews with Big Boi where he's like you know my crazy uncle gave me pounds of love when I was a kid you know he rolled up to be on the skateboard and shucked me the tape how's the love and it changed my life and running up that hill is like my favorite song those are the kinds of people that just like I get it's like fucking injecting a drug I'm so stoked that the lines can be blurred in a community that is so often pressured to conform yeah I mean throughout you know the 90s and the 2000s there were certainly examples of people kind of you know serious oddballs in hip-hop and not even just hip-hop you know all sort of forms of music culture but you know if the internet has kind of erased anything it's it's sort of been the shadows under which those kinds of gems hide now yeah and yeah it's a really good point well yeah you know the thing is I mean I I think now that those shadows are gone I feel almost as if like nobody's kind of allowed to sit in a space and kind of ruminate and get weirder and weirder anymore so that when you finally stumble upon it it's like this weird disfigured mutant thing that you didn't even think could exist we're taught we're talking about the new wolf parade record aren't we I don't know I don't even heard the new wolf parade well they just put out this fucking insane like krautrock fucking nine minute dirge thing on sound on soundcloud and there's a song called Tod Tod D with periods my favorite meme you know going back to 1997 I was fucking spelling things the periods between them is I don't know why it's a stupid everything's in acronyms it's just a stupid fucking thing that nerds gravitate toward they've got this new record that's like the exact representation of what you're talking about it's like what no Age said they did but didn't actually do like we went off and we're actually on another planet right now and don't give a fuck and the music proves it so check it out but even in the instance of Wolf Parade you know you're talking about a band that has you know the least you know at least some relevant still and some people looking at them and expecting something from them and you know not to say that a and and not to say that they're beyond you know giving a fuck you know I'm sure they're you know if if you say it's the truth you know it could potentially be the truth but you know another thing about you know sort of back then is that you know simultaneously while people kind of have this time to ruminate you know while they're putting this music out it's almost as if they're just kind of launching their music into this nothingness where it's getting no response whatsoever and kind of the the real age pre-internet age that could be a really scary situation to deal with for a long time and just continually putting music out there as you grow more and more insane because of a lack of human interaction well look at what happened with fucking Animal Collective remember when the the main dude put out that like backwards piece of shit record with his girlfriend or whatever sure yeah oh my god I mean that's the fucking definitive example how stupid this thing is like your internet famous okay but your internet famous for doing one thing and doing it the same way just like a pop star was in the 80s you know if fuck sure you know Michael Jackson's not coming out with a fuckin backwards acoustic Jam you know on mushrooms and people are gonna find a way to to fucking sell that to FM radio it's not gonna happen yeah and that's the thing about internet fame I think it kind of influences people too and and I don't know why I mean you know if you've been observing internet fame for any longer than two years I don't know why it wouldn't dawn on you but it seems almost as if when people get blasted with this internet fame that it's almost like there's this sense of invincibility so it's like they can almost release anything so instead of getting something that's supremely weird and out there really what you're getting is something that is sold is supremely weird but it really just kind of sounds like very aloof and like you didn't try at all so in when every recorded one of my videos as a podcast about richard gott or the guy who was in the Strangelove's i had a little one i they were there there are things in there that are that are essentially read from the text of the original video but I went on some some tangents to and one of the little one offs I had was with the Internet it's no overhead no profit so it you can have a nine-to-five job and come home and dick around on a four-track and put that shit out on the Internet and be famous in some way and like not have to worry about whether or not it's gonna allow you to make a living cuz you're already making a living another way but music fandom is available to you in as a moonlighting gig that's fuckin crazy all music fans are available to you without you having to make a career out of it hmm so look at Segura Ross and and you know the stuff that Jonesy and those guys were doing after they had established themselves they're like dude I live in Iceland I'm all set financially and I'm not worried about getting rich so I'm not really gonna play this game I'm not worried about you know growing my fanbase or you know any of this bullshit or maybe even the knife to an extent ya know same deal right right and that's that's actually a perfect you know example of the same phenomenon they'll they'll they'll do that and it's not because they think obscurity is a good play for them strategically to make more money it's cuz it's what they want to do and you can't you can't take away their audience because they're just always there sure so are you sort of its it seems like you know we've almost kind of diverted into two different situations over here you know you're saying that you know groups like the knife like cigarettes for example you know they're not necessarily worried about appealing to the widest audience because where they are they're set you know they're not worried about whether or not their next record is gonna allow them to eat but simultaneously it seems like there's some kind of quality control or certain something that's indescribable there when somebody actually has to worry about how much their next album is gonna cost them yep so you know with which side of the fence is the right one to be on or I mean I suppose a great record could come out of either situation it kind of seems like the situation you don't want to be in is when everything costs you nothing well so then I guess you stopped caring well that so my my anecdote for this and it's sort of perfect I interviewed panda bear for Noah for the Village Voice right before I flipped out on the Village Voice for doing things that were so incredibly anti journalistic and quit I had talked to him on the phone while he was in the studio doing Merriweather sure and I said to him this is gonna be a big problem for you because I can tell you right now and this is like in February of that year I said I am telling you right now I know Ryan Schreiber Burroughs is gonna be pitchforks number one albums a year I'm telling you this now I know it it's a fact and it was and this is literally you know one month into the year and he's like nah bro thanks to you that says we do so nice to say that did and I was just like oh shut the fuck up turn off your bullshit you know fucking stop saying everything sweet I fucking can't stand your stick dude but that you know that's his whole little like shell that protects him he's fuckin got a family and he a new kid and we were talking about that because my daughter was like five months old at that point when I did this interview with him and I tried to pose this question to him I'm like how is this gonna work for you when you're like 10 times more famous than the band you're in that's already sort of famous but like you actually become a mainstream name like panda bears gonna be bigger than Animal Collective and he's like nah dude I don't know dude I don't think about that stuff well you're gonna be soon and you know like look what happened he keeps trying to put out records and maintain panda bear and Animal Collective his fucking Dunn's oh sure and this panda bear records fucking suck he hasn't done dick since Bros mmm it's just like he gets distracted by all this shit like he goes and does his DJ gigs and fucking Lisbon or whatever and like that's the reality he surrounds himself with so this is that whole nine to five thing he's just putting out music in the course of his life because his life is sort of all set and that's a whole other argument about how set the guy is an animal two have always been and and this gets into the problem of rich people making music because they can afford to dick around all the time hmm so I did a video about Bruno Mars and and Mark Ronson and I'm like that guy has that's a rich kid dicking around who's done Amy Winehouse's Back to Black it is like taken every fucking ounce of the privilege that was available to him and returned on that and made the best fucking sounding coolest you know coolest ideas fucking Smith that Smith's cover and you know like The Charlatans cover of the only one I know like that shit's fucking brilliant just great ideas and that's what I want from people who have the time to just keep shoving shit into the pipe because they're all set in their lives just do stuff that's like fucking brilliant and fun don't do indulgent fucking space jams in your basement that's just not even trying well no offense to your actual music Anthony I've heard some of it no that's that's that's fine and and not that not that I totally felt like I was making any space jams and not that I have anything against space jams I mean great movie dude but I'm gonna have to talk about tool no I wasn't even go down there let's just let's let's just let's just put a warning sign up on that road and let's just let's just block that road off before anybody even goes down it get me back on so get me back on track I'm trying I'm trying you're just kind of like I guess a mast if that I have on a leash and I'm trying to just pull you in the right direction and I'm just but a little girl and you're just kind of whipping me around wherever you want to go but having said all that it kind of brings up an interesting point that I've talked with my significant other about about how it seems like I guess since the 2000s it's it's it's almost as if there's this increase in the amount of interest that people who seem to come from very wealthy backgrounds have and just kind of either taking pop music are making indie music I'm not exactly sure what the or where the fascination comes from maybe they just kind of come from wealth so they kind of want to I don't know I guess slum it a little bit in the indie scene or they just kind of want to reject that background that they come from I'm not exactly sure where exactly the the desire lies or where it kind of fruits from but I think that's that's Anthony that's that's Iggy Pop that's michael gira that's David Bowie sure these are all well-off kids of okay of wealthy parents who had every advantage in life and yet they just wanted to thumb their noses at it and just be you know spoiled fuckin brats gear gear his dad made fucking more money than you can imagine he had he was pre accepted to the same fucking school that the strokes went to and he was like yeah he just didn't show up sure you know he wanted to fuck around in Europe and be fucking credible it's weird you know it's weird the rejection of the privilege that you're afforded you try to reject it because you know dad doesn't get me or whatever and you got these fucking you know huge issues whether it's oedipal or or you know Saturnia and whatever classical fucking complex you have the problem is you can't run from it you know and you end up putting on a record with your dad on the cover well I think um okay so you've definitely illustrated that the point goes further back then then my personal experience yeah because you know I can only talk about you know where I've kind of come up but I guess the point I was eventually going to make is that it seems like they're thumbing their noses up to that as you said but simultaneously it still seems like there's a big shame factor because there's not really kind of this discussion of class in the indie world because I think if you know despite the fact that it puts on this facade that it's so down-to-earth it's so blue-collar it's so low budget and so DIY but simultaneously you know that that sort of class discussion doesn't happen because if it were to happen some people would have to admit where they come from well it's funny because you know dive right so I'm not gonna call this fucking guy call his name is Zach great burp thank you so like you know Mike sniper you know and capture tracks and all this shit they're selling this whole fucking you know washed out chemical burn that's a bad fresh and I said washed out there they're selling this whole like you know bad Polaroid Lana Del Rey papa you know this fucking this California daydream little bullshit you know these are fucking these are Lindsay know Lindsay Lohan actually was not wealthy but these are just massive massive privileged people that have Steve no responsibilities in life they have every fucking connection available to them to do whatever they want in media he's a fucking fashion model dude come on you know and and yet he wants to market himself as a you know quiet little Kurt Cobain Kurt Cobain yeah I recorded my album in a church and I reject my you know prep school upbringing and those people didn't understand me and they were mean to me god man what the fuck you know like okay well what about the kid who can't afford to buy a fucking guitar is that kids voice like getting heard no it's you cuz you can afford to do this shit sure well it just kind of seems like these are the conversations that we're not really having we're not having if we're not at all like Anthony I don't know you but I have a pretty good idea that you come from a solid fucking working-class background yeah kind of I mean I know where I know the area you're from it ain't the fuck it ain't watermill you know and I you know I'm one generation and removed from fucking literally bailing a hay in Indiana that doesn't mean anything from me I grew up in a total fuckin one-percenter town that's the only experience I have but my parents didn't they work to get there to get me in that school so it wasn't like I was getting fuckin guitar and and I could just go out and mom you know I think I like drums and get a fucking you know $1,800 drumset or get a fucking $23,000 guitar that st. Vincent you know put her fucking name on the print the expense of making music is not inconsiderable when you start playing shows it's not cheap and if you're not famous and you don't have an audience that can guarantee show up and bring in a huge fuckin door for you how are you making them you're not making the money through music you already had it mm-hmm I don't know man you know I look at something like YouTube and what you're doing huge equalizer huge equalizer the same way the internet was for Ryan to come out and take on Rolling Stone it's the same thing you're doing you know and it's because YouTube is saying we're TV station anybody can put on a show and if your show gets a lot of attention we'll give you a couple of bucks it's a it's fucking it's a great fucking situation in my in my opinion the content thing of YouTube and the content thing of the internet knowing well we can pay a semi living you know middle-class wage to somebody without much problem off the architecture we built and remunerative for you know contributing to this this farm alright while this this whole thing has been interesting I feel like we've gotten a little bit off of you know why I originally wanted to have you on here okay you know we have talked about a lot of cool stuff but sort of getting back to pitchfork but more the modern era you know I mean if there's a whole you know spot from when you left up until you know 2010 where I'm much more familiar with the site and much more intimate with kind of their writing style and what was going on as business wise at least from the outside you know as far as this recent buyout with condé nast which is originally why you know I sort of wanted to bring you on here you know is is this a a game-changer in any kind of way does this alter the future of the site in any kind of way are we to expect any kind of voice or coverage change from the website do you think because while some people predicted that and and maybe it's true you know I don't I don't see how it couldn't not affect it in any way simultaneously I feel like pitchfork has sort of voluntarily been grooming itself to make itself marketable for such a by out for a while no there's no question there were offer burgers the thing is like so well I mean as you just kind of mentioned right there and this couldn't have been the first offer that had been thrown on the table you know this has to have been one of many known us point no I know and I'm just I'm trying to choose my words because I don't want to get into shit that I've said on Twitter and whatever because it's not I don't want to get into accusations and stuff but what I'd say is that Ryan turned down more venture capital money than you can even fucking believe from people who just wanted to buy as cool and he's been doing it for almost ten fucking years not real let's say five let's be fair for for more than five years pure media based venture capital firms have been offering Ryan millions of dollars for pitchfork tens of millions of dollars and he's turned him down consistently and that that just I don't care what you think about Conde or the acquisition the speculation about him he and kaske got and whether or not anybody else who's worked for the site and helped build it like say so like right look people left this shit on Ian Cohen right I can't fucking stand him that's fine but it without Ian Cohen what the fuck nobody else is getting hysterical reactions on the site dude like sure they're just not I don't like the guy I don't like his writing I hate his fucking taste he's wrong he didn't live through emo I did I know what emo was I played shows with those bands he's just fucking wrong he's a fanboy mmm-hmm he should be speaking for anyone about what emo or fucking anything and the 90s was because not only was he not there he hasn't done the history but his writing pisses people it's like drew maker at Gawker he's the drew Magary of pitchfork and that's important they don't have good writers a good if you measure a good writer by somebody who gets reaction and keeps attention focused on your site he's the most important writer they've had for the last three years that's fucking crazy but it's true but do you think writing Israel is really what sort of sells the the site anymore at least or at least the writing on the review it never was it was never about the writing it was about the reaction if the right if the right I mean the writing would have to be well I guess I guess my question is to make it more pointed do you think people are really reacting to the writing on the reviews these days as much as they used to because it seems like you know at least when I go on the boards where I'm being discussed as well as pitchfork people are reacting more to the scores and they are simply what's being said or written well anybody who's worried about that mmm I've never understood that but it's become more apparent to me that there is now legitimacy and worrying about that because of the effect of best new music which when that first came out we'd laughed about it we were like yeah okay what is okay so this is like what is this this means nothing but then very quickly it meant everything in you see young kids and in PR companies and new labels to start up their whole life revolves around potentially getting a best new music from pitchfork sure that's fuckin crazy to me dude because we used to joke about how bad labels wanted to be able to put a pitchfork pullquote down a sticker on the front of their CD and that was like a two-year window and then after that it just changed over to we don't even the CD sales don't matter we need some way for the site itself to distinguish this release beyond the numerical rating and that's when I came up with this joke about Tron chain because anybody who's ever been friends with or had anything to do with pitchfork but isn't hooked up with a PR firm that's you know negotiated and manufactured a campaign through pitchfork and his friends with pitchfork they're never getting best new music they're getting trashed they're gonna get a seven point four through seven point eight not best new music and their records gonna die on the vine and it just happened to wax idols and it happens over and over again you know if you're not fed right up the food chain you're not rep by the right people there's no guarantee that you're gonna be available there's no you know for pitchfork festival or whatever it's become so industrial that it is now it's gone from being a joke to being this is deadly fucking serious it's deadly fucking serious but simultaneously do you think the best new music tag has as much weight as it used to because I think you know with the rise of the Internet and the democratization of everything you know as far as music tastes and and the dissemination of music it's it seems like it's less of a decider than it used to be it's more of like one of many stars that have to kind of align in order for an artist to get you know sort of the supreme I guess kind of critical or worse you know positive critical reception it's kind of the Metacritic age you know what I mean well all of these scores are kind of being aggregated by your meta critics and your Wikipedia's you know more than they are just being observed by you know groups of fans who are only going to those single sites to read that one review and that's it I don't know I actually in the the case I would make there is you know yeah Twitter people and people who worry about metadata and Metacritic the kind of responses and and look to feel some sort of consensus for what's going on the set them aside you go try and book a tour with a best new music designation and then go try and look at or without one mmm let me know how that goes no I believe you it's that's it that's it I mean best new music means you're there everybody in the pipeline knows they can book you safely you're gonna pull 250 to 500 people you know you're gonna pull over 1500 in new york best new music is currency it's so crazy to think it but it's so fucking provable no I mean it's it's it certainly is you know and I can pull from a ton of different experiences I mean I went to go see the pains of Being Pure at heart at a VFW show that ya know you could puke you could puke that's not I went to go see them play live at a VFW show but the thing is I got my ticket and the show was booked before their record had been reviewed by everybody you know the whole thing was sort of booked off of the hype of a few of the singles that were on the blogs yeah and then you know once the best new music sort of came through and the positive reviews came through the VFW was packed he got shoulder to shoulder yeah you know also I saw the converge show probably after they came out with their latest full-length record and and pitchfork had actually given it best new music the day of the show and the show had not been sold out prior and and not that they wouldn't have done well because hardcore always does really well right Attica yeah you know the thing about it is is that you know it could have been just a night where me and all the metalheads and all the hardcore kids who saw converge place et in the 90s came down to the venue in New Britain at this venue where they actually used to host a lot of hardcore bands it could have been just that but instead there were a bunch of younger kids there as well you know because of the best new music tag you know kids who you would sort of stereotypically would assume would probably read pitchfork and had seen the the review that day and that's so that's what happened in the real world when Jane Doe came out so when that when that record came out what year is that she was early 2000s right was it 2005 or 2002 dude I can't remember I was never a huge stand for them that for I have that first record before they recorded it and I still don't think they even came close to how amazing that was in terms of like rolling all legit crazy hard metalcore hardcore that I don't I just get so sad about how bad that rerecorded version of the first record is but so when Jane dealt when that came out all of a sudden all the fucking crest rock kids came out of the fucking woodwork it wasn't there was no best new music back then it wasn't even pitchforks review it was like that record became hot topic mall core converge went from you know the biggest like like you know proto Isis crust fucking you know just nasty audience to being you know purple bangs and in in a week and being from Boston it was like what the fuck it was nuts dude and and the whole Hydra head think that whole moment when the first drowning man record came out and like then they went to rock and roll killing machine in like 10 minutes that stuff was really weird and what I'm saying is that whole ability to go and make that step and get the general kind of fervor bnm has corralled all that and it's a fucking calculator button click you go from just being a band with fans that people talk about on message boards on Twitter to and you get past new music it's like boo gook and now you're visible in a way that you weren't before and that's what happened you know what you're a show mm-hm no yeah I mean I've definitely seen it you know happen numerous times and I'm just sort of curious as to sort of what the the future looks like you know for pitchfork and best new music in this relevancy that they've held for a very long time you know with this Conde Nast buyout I mean I think you know a lot of people have been stipulating but the thing is I a lot of people who you know especially watch me I don't know if they really know if this means any I mean I think most Internet users aren't really familiar with what exactly condé nast is or what they mean or okay well so you know the combined properties of Condon asked are estimated to be worth something on the order of two or three billion dollars sure you know of Vanity Fair all the stuff so what's gonna prove this out is what happens when pitchfork gets as far behind a band as they have with deafheaven under the umbrella of Conde when you see a push like that and Brandon it's Brandon's buddy's band he was his little pet band you know I know they think that they did it they're out on their own they didn't this is a fucking pally networking bullshit thing from a guy who didn't realize how fucking much power he had and it got through cleanly you know his bias just he it was like it's it's like it's like fucking clap your hands say yeah and tapes and tapes and all that shit you know that minute when they got booked on Jimmy Fallon or Letterman or what the fuck ever those moments where you have that that huge proved out example in real life that that deafheaven goes from nothing to massive emblematic representation of youth music because of the power of pitchfork to to shape and sell this thing when that when that happens with whatever band it ends up being that it happens to and through that's when you're gonna see what happens because because Conde is not gonna react in the same way you know what I'm saying they're not going to be like you know well we would bid on that one or whatever you know there's going to be a response and it's gonna really shake a lot of stuff a response in in terms of what I mean will they be influencing them to start doing a certain kind of coverage or will they be trying to preemptively prevent some kind of coverage from occurring so okay so the way the magazine industry works is you have two two sides of the house edit and pop so I so I don't work there any more for 10 years I worked for timing I worked at People magazine I was the the IT support for the executives of Time Inc I used to go out to fucking Anne Moore's house which is literally the last house before the Atlantic Ocean and watermill just to turn the cd-player on when Cameron Diaz was doing a benefit that was my life for about five years when I lived in New York City when you're in a real magazine you have pub and edit pub is sales operations all the industrial stuff and they have staff and they have opinions and they have weight there is no pub at pitchfork there never has been it's all edit welcome to the fucking nightmare because now that you're at Conde you're gonna have input and demands from the publishing side of the house to prove your zeal you know oh you love this band perfect pussy they are so radical they have all these radical feminist viewpoints did you know they were just featured and playboy isn't that a problem those questions don't get asked when you're a hundred percent edit when you're pub they get asked because it creates a conflict of interest sure absolutely but uh you know I'm sure there's plenty of politically incorrect content that might fly on some of the other you know publishing or some of the other websites no it's not it's Conde Nast has under its you know flagship it's not about the political correctness what I'm saying is it's about the footprint in the real world your edit side is telling you this band is amazing oh my god Ashlee Simpson is the second coming what happened when she went on SNL sure that is the collapse of editorial hype promotional zeal versus the reality that the publishing side of the house is responsible okay well that well then maybe I for Herot to our liking it to the to the fact you know I I have a friend of mine who you know is very interested in music writing who does help me up say yeah can't talk right now who does help me update the site you know on a regular basis although you know it could be updated more regularly as I'm hearing but whatever you know who it has you in kind of observing are you doing it are you doing a fucking soft release or something with me or what's going on no I'm not okay but anyway you know he's been kind of very closely observing pitch work since the conde nast thing and he says three man three they put up three Adel articles today I'm telling you dude they're gonna you know I don't know what he thinks is going to happen but he's kind of very hotly you know he's very hotly tracking how many Adel articles he's wrong he's right and they're there I got a couple of followers on Twitter who've been screaming about this and I'm kind of like well I can't get that excited because duh but yeah you're gonna get Conde trying to use the pitchfork brand to apply it to other interests because because you know Adele's relevancy helps their other brands as well it's not yeah and it well it's also about the fact that you're talking about celebrity maintenance right so everybody go back to the very beginning we started talking when Questlove talks about you know Jay Z's saying to him dude you can't you know put this record together and get a 6.5 from pitch for you got a hit with those kids that's what Condes mentality is their mentality is well you know she's famous you need to talk about that because you're supposed to be you know a music website but pitchforks hole you know to Tombstone has always been theists the essential guide to independent music and beyond well now it's just the essential guide to beyond you know it's just they're gonna have to start being thorough a you know I made the joke on Twitter they're idolaters they're not I told her but they're gonna be managed like a Gawker property now they're gonna be pointed in directions that never would have happened before it wouldn't have happened before but it sounds like going back to one of the earliest points in our conversation that sort of allowing what's hitting what's relevant what's popular to kind of guide what you actually end up covering should have been something that they would have ended up doing anyway correct or Milou and I said that all along hmm you had you had the selfish positively selfish subjective direction of Ryan about what was and wasn't pitchforks you know boundary okay so I mean if if this boundary should be broken down anyway then what exactly is the danger and Condon asked kind of guiding them in this way if they are absolutely zero it's better and I said that I've said that in a couple of places it's better for pitchfork with the control and the the power that it has to influence sure to be controlled by checks and balances okay so so you think this is something that's going to be healthy for the website going into the future yeah in the sense that they're not gonna be able to fuck up anymore sure you know they're gonna they're gonna it you know so Chuck Klosterman you know piece with Taylor Swift and GQ has been all over this week that's the kind of stuff you're gonna see on pitchfork it's not going to be about Taylor Swift but you're gonna see the snowfalls start to be about current that you're not gonna see a snowfall article about ovals ninety four this gone that that article you know Mark Britt that's Mark Richardson that's not just Mark Richardson that is pitchfork swan song for pitchfork that that feature on 94 to Scott mark Richardson's favorite record one of my favorite records it is the meeting point for me and Mark to the extent that we work together for all those years that record was so fuckin transformative for obsessive like I said you know back there music people who were obsessed with what could happen in music who would just when girl boy came out the single from that aphex twin Richard G James record and then when window liquor came out these these records just fucking totally reset your entire fucking mentality around music this can happen what and and that's that goes all the way back to when art of noise came out in 83 84 with moments and love and who's afraid of the art of noise it was like holy shit is this music what is this and when things happen that are that alien and fucked up and crazy it's people like us that go nut for that conde nast is not going to know go nuts for that and and so when you have that instance of the cheerleading impulse that you and I and everybody else who goes crazy for music and just can't help them fucking selves to go nuts like this fucking makes me go crazy I'm not fucking gonna kill myself because this record might come out two years from now I'm gonna fucking miss it hmm that is gone it's it's not gonna happen again okay well it's it seems like it it's it seems like if anything of value is going to be lost in in sort of this buyout it's going to be that then yeah it is they're not going to be able to be selfishly self directive to the extent that they have claimed to be and been at various points sure okay so you're saying you know the kind of favoritism they may show to deafheaven or you know an animal collective or something like that you know that might come around in a more rare fashion you care you can't if you're owned by Conde Nast you can't launch a band anymore because the band's you know you got you got problems you got PR companies you got fucking you know not labels anymore but you got distribution groups you got beggars group you got to Excel all these connections connections those become real battlegrounds when you're owned by a publicly traded company and nobody at pitchfork gets that having said all of that you know we we could probably go a million years on all of this shit and there's probably going to be more to come to react to you know as far as music industry and and and as well as pitchfork and you know needle drop stuff in the future to discuss so you know considering how fruitful this conversation has been I think we're gonna have to call it here and I'll just invite you on for another conversation in the future Chris sure yeah works for me man I mean this is fucking I might as well be on the fucking therapist couch this is great well I think I'll have to charge you the next time that you come by well no you could then you'd have to publish the YouTube rates man okay okay it's trade secrets and crazy okay I get it I get it I get it okay these these conversations will remain free then all right well thanks for coming on dude oh man thank you for having me it was really fun and you know I love going back and forth you so it was really fun and down in the description box I mean should I link to your Twitter account I mean what else should I link to if you want to really link to shallow rewards com I'm forwarding the podcast site to there that'd be nice okay we will do that and so he's Chris OTT thanks for being a guest on the show Anthony Brenton oh thank you for having me bro "
PC1_k2jhCTk,hi everyone head of the knitters tanno here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new twitching tongues record disharmony twitching tongues is a california metal band this is their third full-length LP i believe but their first four Metal Blade Records and the band features none other than Taylor Young of nails fame on guitar and vocals that nails connection as well as the metal blade nod and the fact that these guys are a metalcore all metal band kind of got the best of my curiosity decided to try this record out and review it however I did not try this album out alone none other than mr. Mike C town of dead and hip hop but also his own solo YouTube channel where he does underground hip hop reviews he does metal reviews joined me to discuss this record and you will see that discussion right after the transition and here we are via the magic of the Internet and also a shirt change too we have a mr. Mike C town known for his metal reviews but also you know he's part of the dead end hip hop crew sitting in with me on this metal review over here this new twitching tongues record Mike what did you earn would just think about this record ah what I think about this record but first thing that came to mind was what what the fuck did I ever do to you to deserve this I I have never heard of twisting tongue twitching tongues sorry until you asked me about one do this review and I yeah sure why not dude I have not listened to a twitching tongues record in full either and you know what I mean I I liked sort of what I was hearing generally from the teaser tracks and then I think when I finally sat down and listened to it and and you know I had already invited you at this point I had invited you to sit down and with me on this review and when I finally sat down and listened to I was just thinking myself what the fuck did I get us into and I do I said Mike is probably really angry with me right now and he must think he must think there's bad blood between me and him because the whole coucher chesta thing and I'm trying to punish him by making the switching tongues right Kurt I was like I thought we were cool but I guess not like you troll the fuck out of me cuz you're like oh it's it's having some conversation with nails so I'm please it does what yes somebody grandmother goes to church when with the other guys grandmothers what is the connect okay honestly I thought that this was really really terrible like and I mean and and I think I can already guess um with the one element about each song that ruins the track and I gotta say it's the drumming yeah the drums yeah right the drummer's drunks are just a little more on tempo this record would have been hasty but it's just the drums man the drums are all fucked up you're absolutely right and then that poor singer trying to overcompensate for the shitty drumming yes yes obviously he's he's doing what he's doing focally to distract you from what's going on with the drums and I bet you just didn't you didn't even notice that because you were distracted by the vocals you're right you're right this is why you are who you are and I'm a nobody if no I did not catch the horrible drumming I was too caught up in the those fuckin vocals oh man alright so I mean it's the to let you know Mike and I are obviously joking but the the the vocals on this record are absolutely excruciating some of the most excruciating vocals I've ever heard on a metal record in a long time and I think that there are moments where they're actually like borderline interesting um the intro track the song cannibal maybe a little bit of the outro track too but these are songs where I feel like the vocals kind of take on the this element of aggression to them and they're not so tonal they're not trying to sing a melody or anything like that they're pretty tolerable and I think sort of when the vocals are taking this more aggressive approach they do have kind of a unique cadence to them but there are so many songs on here where he's trying to do something melodic just the guitars really oh open up and allow him to do his and it's it's so it's like his feet are being held to hot coals and he is being forced to sing this song at the same time you know what the there was only one point on this entire record that I thought his vocals worked and it wasn't on one of the more aggressive songs it was a love what's it called love love love conquers none yeah that song that song was actually alright it sounded like Candlemas and then like that nice atmosphere to it but the second it got even remotely heavy it's like oh he goes back into that fucking awful yelling thing and it sounds like crap but when it gets even worse is when you know he's multi-tracking in his own background vocals oh and he's singing with himself and o'ciock room is like dude stop stop you're fucking up our record why I think it's kind of his band you know oh okay look bacon about I think I think that might kind of be that that's I mean that's that's obviously the dynamic going on here like nobody in the room is saying these vocals are bet out of the band God in the band maybe not but I mean still man it definitely lives up to the title disharmony it's you can't say you didn't get what they put on the fucking cover Mike your app you're absolutely right but that's still this is still not what I was expecting I was not expecting something that sounded this fucking bad and I I trust me I get it I understand why he's singing like that because if you take away the vocals this is the most generic music in the world so it like you throw those vocals over I mean it still sounds just like only living witness or maybe a little bit worse marauder but if you take away those vocals there's nothing that stands out about this record so I get it but at the same time those vocals are just so bad that I was I was listening to this record over and over and over again tried I figure out what it was that people like he's trying to get the appeal of it yes and it didn't work as all I could think of was like dude with no shirt and tribal tax like jumping around like bro maximum laughing I like the thick production I like that is some of the riffs on here really visceral but especially during the singing moments when he was just trying to get super melodic I couldn't help but feel like you know this is just like one sweet hook away from just being like a new metal song or something you know just like a song that was kicked ass on the radio in the 2000s but it's nowhere near clean and commercial and like well performed enough to be that but it feels almost like inspired by that in a really weird way yeah because I think those those lines were kind of blurred around the mid-2000s so though yeah yeah I feel like that whole new metal hardcore thing because kind of worked but I didn't you know that's this definitely the thing those worlds and the 2000s were separate but this album almost like brings them together into a really ugly weird newton monstrosity that is so offensive like offensively bad but also you can't like look away from it in a way because it's I don't know freakish me bad at some points the sad thing is there are moments where I'm like okay this song could have been good like the very first song there's a pretty cool Slayer riff in there I was like oh yeah cuz right then they fucked it up again of course but and then like on one of the later songs there was a part that sounds like integrity which is one of my favorite bands I was like okay that was cool but there's all these like super derivative chugga chug parts that sounds like something that would have been written by any random hardcore band 20 years ago so I don't and why they're doing it now that's true you know and I think um I think the fact that that's true is partially why when I was listening to this thing I wanted the vocals to work so much because if the vocals did then this band would be super out there in kind of eccentric but because the vocals don't work and I've first I was thinking okay sounds kind of hardcore ish it sounds like a bit of a new metal thing but maybe it's just kind of this weird out there can't be metal vocal that I just kind of need to adjust my ears to like a merciful fate kind of thing you know but the more I listen to it the more I was just like uh no this is just like if it's this that's a total pipe dream that's that's nowhere near reality then you have what if you think about that weird like Depeche Mode II like electric oh I could the bit the be in the weren't one of the worst tracks with the variant with a very simple beat going on in the background but then there's like kinda romantic chords come in and sounds all gah yeah oh no oh no I get it was one of those came it's like I kind of get what they were trying to do it was like life of agony meets the pêche mode in like a really really bad dive bar but they just failed miserably with this and it made no sense it was like third to last on the album why yeah I mean the I think by the end of the record I mean between that track and the eight-minute closer that just has so many different sections to it I feel like they just threw so many Hail Marys toward the end of the record but you know not to say that there weren't a few at the beginning I mean I thought how aggressive cannibal was and a lot of conquerors none with this sort of acoustic guitar passages or you know at least guitar passages that weren't sort of overly distorted and chugging all over the place we're definitely a little out of place and to me in Sincerely Yours was like maybe the worst vocal performance on the entire record like you know to me the record really went from you know disharmony the title track which I thought it was decent and I thought the vocals worked there in a sense but then immediately was just like no no no it's like it bunched together one of its best tracks with its worst tracks and from there on out I think that really kind of sets the tone for the album it's like songs that I absolutely can stand put together with tracks that I think are somewhat decent and then all of a sudden you know maybe two or three more tracks that I cannot stand and then maybe a weird unexpected electronic be in the background that just makes those sets in the context of the record see your your ears are a little different than mine there was there was nothing on here that I thought was actually decent enough for me to ever want to listen to this again I I think there were just a few moments where the vocals worked for me you know and that's and that may be I think enjoy the track independent of the fact that yeah in the background like the drum parts and the guitars are you know super nondescript you know I mean sure it's fusing together a bunch of different metal styles you know some hardcore and left metal and all that but it's it's still very far away from being anything original um yeah I mean this this record is pretty pretty unapologetically uh bad in a lot of ways you know but especially the vocals and I can't say I liked it not even a little and I want to say sorry yeah yeah yeah I mean I kind of sort of accept your apology yeah um he's not I mean setting me up by talking about nails and then going into this those really that was I feel set up okay it was it was I was I was excited okay I was legitimately excited going into this record okay I don't really know what to say cuz I actually feel bad cuz they're probably nice guys but it probably are but this record is just one of the worst things I've heard in years easily and that's covering the gamut of all genres well it's almost like you know it's almost like a fucking a high school talent show band like that's there's nothing that's overly exceptionally talented or or interesting or innovative or anything about this it's just super generic yeah and I mean I think also we come you know my mind goes back to the image of shirtless drunk dudes with backwards baseball caps and tribal tats it just feels so it just feels so dated yeah odd we dated it's not a bat kind of dated it's just like it's like a we left this sound behind 20 years ago for a reason kind of dated yeah that's the part that's so confusing to me about this it's like it lets all the worst parts of that era have sort of resurfaced on this new record over here if they never got heavy I feel like this could have been tolerable like there was one song where he was doing like this weird like Mike Patton thing uh-huh music was it super heavy behind it yeah oh okay if you did more stuff like this it could be alright and then he that goddamn guitar comes in with this fucking chugga chug bullshit and it's like you guys ruin everything and so it was like one of most frustrating listens the entire time my face is just turned up like like what is this yeah I mean I pretty much had the same reaction but also I also I also had like a fear I was like oh man what if Mike likes this yeah I figured you probably did because I suggested it I suggested I was like okay you know we got to check this out then you were like he's gonna like this and I'm gonna be like I have to argue with him about this what but yeah it was I was like I wonder if Mike's gonna like this I wonder how that's gonna make the conversation I thought you already liked this band well I heard I heard the title track disharmony and I heard another teaser track which you know we're two of the tracks that I thought stood out for me on the record and you know I thought the vocals were weird and while I didn't think that they were amazing the strangeness of the vocals were partially what drew me into this this brand and this album because I was like okay that's fucking odd no it's really weird but the thing is you know once once I kind of peeled back the the the coffin cover you know it was just like putrid absolutely yeah yeah um I'm just gonna say I'm feeling like a like maybe a light two decent three on this record it's really just lost on me you know I think the production is there you know I think the instrumentation sounds clear heavy thick there are a few tracks that I think are okay and the vocals are at least intriguing to a point but a vast majority of this record is is very painful to the mind and I think Mike agrees over here I absolutely do and and and if the band watches this I apologize I don't mean any disrespect this is just it's just not not good for my ears either I wish you guys all the best of luck but this will never get played in anything that has speakers around me ever again it's it's I'm sure you will be impersonating these vocals for the next few weeks so I've been doing it quite a bit might like yeah yeah I'm gonna do it tonight some more because okay makes me giggle well good luck on that yeah yeah I'm getting good at it no reverb oh I'm getting I'm getting better like maybe I saw a band like this if if you could and then throw them in a time machine - ten years ago you probably be good yeah get off came back so I can't bad chugga chug parkour that's true that's absolutely true you work on the band I will get the time-travel science together wait and I think you'll probably have a tougher time than me and we'll come on the middle all right I want to thank Mike c-town again for coming on and talking with me about this record I will leave a link to his YouTube channel down there in the description as well as dead in hip-hop but you guys should already know about dead and hip-hop by now but so long Mike see Tony does a lot of solo album reviews of just not only underground hip hop records but metal records as well you still doing that metal Monday shit dude I'm trying but I get behind I'm gonna do one next Monday I know I'm a fuck on don't slack on that shit and also you know just tons of final updates - which are great because he's got a pretty eclectic Meinl collection all right we're gonna leave it at that Anthony Fantana Mike c-town twitching tongues 
B8b-IAwaudA,today hippy birthday happy birthday happy birthday happy birthday to you hi everyone Anthony fan canto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the brand spankin new proto martyr record the agent intellect these guys are in Detroit Michigan and they are on their third full-length LP with this record it's their second for the hardly art label that last album that they dropped I thought it was a pretty competent post-punk record I'm usually a sucker for this kind of stuff however I couldn't really say it was hitting me in such a way where I actually found it memorable however I did dig the teaser tracks going into this new album over here so curiosity got the best of me had to dig my heels into it and try it out see what was up and I really liked the production on this thing the guitars are a little rough the bass is resonant the drums are sort of distant but punchy the vocals are very prominent and upfront much of the time the performance is on here feel very live they feel very fluid very in the moment the vocal delivery the singing style it's despondent its Moody it's dark it's dejected reminds me a little bit of alias from ice age although proto martyr's sound is completely different actually I would say there's somewhat different from a lot of other post-punk acts both new and old in comparison with a lot of the greats a lot of the classics I think proto martyrs instrumental performances are a little reserved steady the band comes off is very cool and collected not really the most intense or distinct or wild sound but at least this more reserved delivery that the band has allows for the songs on this record to really shine when they do happen to be good like with the song uncle mother's which is an incredibly dark and heavy sound actually one of the most wild tracks on the entire record that features this very tense tight fast spun creepy little melody baby baby baby a very explosive end but one of my favorite cuts on the entire record is easily the intro track the devil in his youth I think the vocal melody here is pretty fantastic I actually like the vocal delivery and the lyrics on this record the most and the lyrics are actually consistently pretty poetic descriptive vivid on much of the record I think the chord progression on this track is really great it's kind of romantic it adds a certain I don't know allure to the song here and sort of paints this character portrait a little bit somebody who is dark but simultaneously dangerous and on the song dope cloud I love the lyrics again the vocal delivery just comes off as so defeatist and depressing it's not gonna save you man it's not gonna save you man and on the song I forgive you this track features one of those kind of freaky herky-jerky post-punk dance grooves that I find so attractive that I think is so amazing about the genre that you can have bands that are making such a danceable music but it is very oddly grooved and very dark and very sinister so instrumentally the band can be a little all over the place with this record and vocally a little bit too on the song blah blah sorry the vocals on this track actually are like a dead ringer for an 80s Nick Cave it's actually quite odd how it's it's almost like Nick Cave comes out of nowhere to sing a guest spot on here and then again there are other parts on this record where the vocals are sort of listless and moaning and tucked behind the guitars and they just don't really come off as that striking mostly on the song Ellen which not only tune wise I think is one of the weakest tracks here and structurally I mean the last 1 minute and 30 seconds of this thing completely uninteresting and just kind of a rehash of everything that came before it and not only that but the vocals just are so faint in the mix they might as well not even be there and another moment on the record where I think the vocals struggle with the instrumentation a little bit is the song pontiac 87 one of the tracks where the vocals are just way too low in the mix especially given that lyrically we're actually getting a really morbid dark and interesting story here there are a handful of weak tracks on this record but the meth the there are a handful of weak tracks on this record but the vast majority of it is catchy Moody post-punk fun I don't think so the lyrics are engaging and worth diving into the vocals are electrifying and an interesting engaging a lot of the time the tunes are most definitely there I just think some of the instrumental performances are a little tame in sort of middle-of-the-road every once in a while sort of like on the song why does it shake where the transition from part one to part 2 of the track is a little rough and the finishing instrumental bridge just doesn't really add much of anything to the song overall by then the chords the groove much of what has been going on in the track has kind of gone stale yeah I guess I'm just wishing for some more intense performances coming from the guitars and the drums that really would have just lit some of these tracks up but uh I could just continue going on forever I'm gonna say I'm feeling a light too decent 7 on this thing I liked it a lot I came away singing and just remembering a lot of these tracks if you're looking for a rock record with a dark edge then give this thing a listen hmm Tran whoo session on a mission tell me what you're wishing for me to review for me to review on this channel should I wear a shirt or a flannel in the next video tell me where we go with this next album review and this new album over here did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it stop watching never end of the video forever 
afMOGoaN47o,hi everyone run thony run tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Machine Gun Kelly record general admission Machine Gun Kelly Cleveland rapper 2012 double XL freshman and now on his second full-length commercial record he made his commercial debut a few years ago didn't really care for the singles from it of his style lyrically and vocally didn't really stick out to me the singles didn't really appeal to me either yeah I mean I just feel like Machine Gun Kelly for me personally sort of got lost in the haze of other more promising rappers of that year his sound just seemed kind of trendy and a little run-of-the-mill but occasionally he would bust a fast speedy flow in his most skilled moments he has a pretty strong Eminem influence again just wasn't really sticking out to me but now in 2015 with the relative success of his new album over here I think I'm actually getting a bit of a clearer picture of Machine Gun Kelly and I decided to kind of just dive headfirst into this new record morbid curiosity getting the best of me a lot of suggestions to check this thing out as well right right from the get-go right from the starting track of this album he is so desperate to stir up some kind of drama it's just sickening especially on the instrumental to this opening track where we get these huge in the air tonight like drum fills and then all of a sudden these overly epic vocals which I believe come from Lizzy Hale and maybe I would have enjoyed her voice in another context but I just feel like it adds to the copious amounts of cheese that this song brings to the table instrumentally as far as the lyrics go while I'm sure that there is a lot of personal importance too much of what MGK is saying on this song and he does seem to have over some struggle and hardship in order to get to where he is that he does bring up in this track I just feel like this track is too bogged down into the minutiae of his rap if you're not really a huge fan of who he is or his backstory or his history I can't say you're going to get too much out of this track honestly because the beat I think is awful and MGK himself I feel like can just merely hold his own as far as lyrics and flow goes he's not wowing me on those fronts so it really sells this music is the man it's the back story it's the person who this album is named after and I'm just not really struck by his personality sort of like the following track alpha-omega where we get lines featuring Machine Gun Kelly posturing as a real muthafucka and saying let them come at me I practice jiu-jitsu this song also features one of a few completely unnecessary and out-of-place Martin Luther King & King family references the next one is on the song world series I believe where Machine Gun Kelly basically says he has rap dreams and then evokes the image of Martin Luther King we have come so far for one track after another we get the spacious somewhat trap influenced instrumentals with completely horrendous and uninteresting flows and beats it's like Machine Gun Kelly doesn't know how to hit us with anything but a basic flow for the first part of this album spare you know one speedy spot here and there now the music actually does change gears on the song bad motherfucker featuring Kid Rock but this track sounds like a horrible country infused rap rock throw away from Kid Rock's like early 2000s career believe it or not this is where the album takes a turn for the worse the first song on this album that I actually like to a degree I don't really love it I just simply like it is the song ounce which kicks off with Machine Gun Kelly and his buddies getting stopped by the cops and they have an ounce on them so you know what are they going to do but instead of being a story he just kind of uses this opportunity to talk a lot of lyrical trash which is fine it has one of the catchiest flows on the entire record and it has one of the sweetest beats on the entire record but it is one of the shortest tracks on the album and I can hear in in Kelly's voice that this is not one of the most important songs on the album to him this is not one of the songs on this record where he's trying to make a big bold personal grand statement and the grandest of these statements actually come in the second half of this record where the album slows down a little bit kind of gets personal maybe a few tears are shed but even here this album sort of fails to impress the song every day I do like the instrumental here but the groove of it especially on the verse is sort of reminds me of Kendrick Lamar's poetic justice though I will say the personal very personal lyrics on this track make Kelley more relatable than he's been on any other part of this record which makes me feel like there's no reason for these overly sentimental instrumentals there's no reason for him to be trying to force these emotions force this drama on listening audience if the story you're telling is down-to-earth it's real and it's seriously emotionally painful you don't need all of those bells and whistles the story itself is powerful which is also the case for the song story on the stairs I think the instrumental here is just a little overly dramatic too but the tale that he tells on the song of growing up and and his estranged mother is actually really heartbreaking one of the few moments on this record where I was just wow man that's really heavy shit but after this Machine Gun Kelly starts delivering just more huge overly illustrious just overwrought instrumentals whose hooks are just super big-budget super booming reminds me of Eminem's worst radio singles of the mid and late 2000s songs like gone and merry-go-round or the song a little more with Victoria Monet where it sounds like MGK on this track is trying to go as commercial as possible with this hook and these completely gutless drums hanging in the background and this piano that that just sounds so mclemore but like in the worst way possible again this is my opinion but it just fails for me on so many fronts the instrumentals I think are the worst part about this album they're just so desperate to tug it any person's heart strain does anybody doesn't even matter who there's not even a target audience just anyone's emotions will do for these instrumentals and then on top of them I don't really care for what a lot of MGK is doing lyrically either he's making me just I roll again and again and again with his one-liners or I feel like the the very good intentions behind his more personal struggles in these tracks get lost in these terrible glitzy instrumentals which the features on this album only add to I will give him props though for trying to you know pretty much hold this entire album himself he just has guest singers on this thing you really tried to just make this whole album about him he didn't hand over a bunch of you know album time to other featured artists he really just tried to pull through on this thing on his own and and even though I don't like it I mean it does really sound like the album he wanted to fucking make which I I totally commend him for that but I am obviously not who he is making this album for this record to me is like the worst of every white male hip-hop artist of the 2000s condensed into one album and released ten years later I'm feeling a strong to to a light three on this thing transition ition did you give this album listen if you did did you hate it what would you rate it tell me what I should review next you're the best you're the best you are the best have a nice day it's my birthday today hey 
GasAQC2TVcA,the world is round hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new joanna newsom album divers newest him know some way joanna newsom she new somewhat antony joanna newsom new some wet joanna new so some wet what she no no shot of it stop trouble shot joanna newsom is a harp plucking singer/songwriter in indie darling and this is her fourth full-length album she is back with this record over here after a five-year long studio album silence which hasn't really been that arduous of a way since with her last record she gave us so much material to digest this is a three part record it was two hours long loaded with tracks that were influenced by classical and Baroque era music folk music as well as a little bit of jazz as well there were definitely multiple sides to this album and it was a high-water mark of ambition for Joanna's discography she's really given this album time to breathe but now with this new album over here there were some singles that tease toward the release of this thing which I liked although I didn't really go into this thing expecting her to top have one on me or really deliver anything wildly different because even as Johanna isn't dropping music or has been dropping music over the past five years no one's really kind of usurped her position as this oddball queen of underground and experimental and eclectic folk music she is still a really standout artist and almost still to a fault to the point where her very eclectic musical mannerisms turn some people off she's pretty polarizing in some respects especially with her vocals which continue to be an acquired taste but for those who love Joanna's music she's really yet to do wrong in the eyes of her audience as far as full-length albums go and I think she sort of content use this very good album streak with divers over here now this album obviously is nowhere near as grand as have one on me but I don't really think it's any less special I actually appreciate the more direct delivery Joana is giving us with this new record over here at least on the musical side of things I feel like we're getting a bit of the mystical world of her debut record and yees mixed with some of the more modern musical sounds that were on have one on me divers is essentially the bridge between these two worlds and it's nice I enjoy it however it's not really that new or bold of a sound for Joana so I wouldn't really be surprised if this record didn't carry too far outside of her immediate fan base just because it's not really that new or exciting of a sound for her musically Johanna isn't really breaking too much new ground on this thing but divers still stands on the quality of its melodic writing its instrumental arrangements its eclectic and very emotional vocal performances and its songwriting - I think the characteristic about this album that makes it special and makes us stand out from the rest of Joanna's discography is the most subtle of all of the elements going into this album and that's the lyrics in some ways the lyrics on this record resemble the lyrics of past records they still try to build up this land of musical make-believe they're very esoteric they're not visceral all that often they're very hard to read kind of opaque and they sound like they sort of come from a fairytale land of some sort but each of these songs dive into different stories and situations while continually making references to time and death and existence and constants which I think I'll get deeper into the ideas of that later into this review musically I think the album starts off very nicely with the song ancestors which I think kind of has a vibe of a morning a sunrise things are going from just complete silence to cold to totally warm and just embracing I love the growing synthesizers and woodwinds and and strings on this track especially as the song progresses toward its finish they are absolutely gorgeous and Johanna is wonderful vocally laced into them but one thing about this track is that it is very very piano driven just as many other songs on have one on me were and of course there are still harp presence on this album but a vast majority of the songs on this record are very piano driven the harp sort of feels like it's a little bit more in the background on many of these tracks so Johanna taking things in a bit more of a piano direction this continues on to the next tracks a Peconic an which is this multifaceted winding story of a tune with a very beautiful finish and the most prominent thing right at the beginning of this track is that piano once again and there are some really just wonderful swaggering piano phrases all over the beginning of this track that I like a lot that I think have a lot of personality this type of swagger you don't often hear in Joanna's music between this piano between the drums and Joanna's vocals I think the song has quite a bit of pep and and once again that mood change that occurs maybe in the last third of the song which brings us to that very wonderful ending is a very nice change of pace too but as good as the instrumentation is the lyrics really feel like the driving force of the song I almost feel like I'm listening to some kind of Tolkien book set to music the music of joanna newsom the music of the song when i'm just kind of paying attention to what she's singing with leaving the city the harp takes the spotlight once again and the lyrics here don't quite feel as archaic as Joanna's lyrics do they're a little bit more modern which makes the story here feel a little more anachronistic because this is one of the tracks on the record that that musically actually kind of goes back in time and and I don't know feels maybe a bit medieval but the horns and the the keys or electric guitar or something there's some kind of searing instrument on this mix that's just tucked away behind Joanna's vocals in the harp that adds a lot of character to the instrumentation on here it definitely gives a different vibe than you would normally get from a joanna newsom song and I think this track has the most hard-hitting and decisive and visceral maybe even explosive melody on the entire record which hits a really odd groove - but I just love the sort of strange loop that this theme melody has and on the song goose eggs another noticeable change of pace Johanna indulges in the kind of folk and American country-western balladry that you would typically expect from drag city records like something Bonnie Prince Billy might do it's actually really sweet song and Joanna's vocals go from there sort of odd mystical eclecticism to something that's kind of soulful the twang guitars on this track are really nice I mean this track could have even fit in a pedal steel and it would have fit the personality of the song perfectly it's interesting to kind of hear Johanna go in this direction of course she's proved her versatility on have one on me but didn't know she could so easily slip into something of this style and have it be one of the most charming songs on the entire record and then with the following cut waltz of the 101st Lightborn we get into the lyrics a little bit on this track it's kind of war themed Joanna's voice continues on the sort of soulful streak and story-wise Johanna sort of seems to be playing this lover whose significant other dies in battle or just dies as the result of a battle and if you continue with the lyrics on this track things get kind of interesting and maybe even a little sci-fi ish as Joanna starts to sing about themes of time and space and traveling light in sort of the future and the past it feels almost a little steam punky or maybe sort of in this anachronistic world of science but also the Industrial Revolution kind of like maybe a bit of BioShock Infinite inspired or maybe something where you kind of see multiple dimensions sort of living out their own different trajectories like interstellar or something like that and the second half of this album I don't think it's quite the stunner the first half is we have a few detour tracks here that that don't sound is lush instrumentally as many of the other cuts here but there's something about what is said in the lyrics and also the personality of these tracks that I think works into what divers is trying to do conceptually on the song not only is there this theme of New York as a city kind of like going on living on just continuing but I also like the sort of low fire oni instrumentation I think the song is really hypnotic I wish it kind of fit in aesthetically with the rest of the record but the song itself feels like a bit of a throwback a bit of a memento from the past and I think this album is something that's very much tortured by the past or concerned with the past concerned with history concerned with the future as well and on the track things I say we get a continuation of the themes on this album of Aging and regrets and existence and once someone dies is that a life that is unlived or does it carry on in some kind of alternate world or something and musically this is a very stripped back tune as well mostly vocals and piano with a strange reverb insert of instrumentation right at the end of the track which sort of ends the song entirely it sounds almost as if the track is kind of sucked away into an abyss or sort of brought up in a UFO or something it just sort of disappears before my very ears on the track listing here but still I do like that on this song as well we're kind of getting this old-school American folk music tradition embraced once again unfortunately these songs add to a somewhat disjointed feel on this record a little bit but I think it's mostly because these tracks are supposed to represent different times or periods or places or something it's almost as if the second half of this album Johanna spends time now that the theme and I guess the concept has been kind of set visiting different spots and giving us different snapshots of I don't know stories emotions that might relate to some of what's being sung about in the tales on the first half of this record I think the title track is maybe the strongest moment on the entire second half of this record I think the instrumental is absolutely gorgeous shows off more Joni Mitchell and more Kate Bush influence than she's ever shown off before on a previous record and the chord changes on this track are excellent and they totally fit the very dramatic lyrical imagery that is brought up throughout this track on this song a Johanna singing is not only great but it's toned down to the point where I can really hang on every single word and she constantly brings up words that make me feel as if I'm just sliding downward into a watery abyss and the music certainly gives off that vibe as well and I was little disappointed that some tracks like you will not take my heart alive are as short as they are to sort of have an abrupt ending to them I do think that has to do with sort of the snapshot characteristic of the latter half of this album or sort of giving us these moments and we don't get to stay in them as long as we want or they're kind of torn away from us by time I guess what I'm trying to say is that there is this longing there is this desire for consistency and for something constant to occur but because change is inevitable because change is necessary and change often happens when we don't want it to occur then stuff is just changing and torn away from us and it's just gone I think that's an interesting idea even if it impacts a few of the tracks in the last half of this record in a somewhat negative way though I do think it impacts the final track on this record in a very interesting way not only is this one of the most fiery tracks on the record and has a beautiful instrumental crescendo toward the very end but Joanna's vocals as they are intensifying and she's singing about transcending and transitioning or transmitting in this cyclical mantra on the very end of the song she ends on that trans and it's just totally done and the intro track here actually starts with her singing sending as the first word and it sort of gives the album this sort of loop quality and maybe other songs on this album linked together in a very similar way that I haven't totally figured out yet overall I thought this was a great album not a whole lot of complaints about it other than that you know I just wish it sort of went into a few more different musical directions for and sort of took a bit more musical risks but still I think the songwriting overall is very great I think the vocal and the instrumental performances are fantastic I think the lyrics and the concept going into this record were very good very entertaining intriguing yeah I have a few reservations about the record but it's really not enough to take away from its beauty and its really refreshing lyrical ideas it's not a big album but it's definitely an enveloping album and album I can get kind of lost and not only because I think it presents a different musical world as most joanna newsom albums usually do but also a different lyrical world something slightly different from what Johanna typically does I would actually say this record presents a different side to Joanna's personality altogether which i think is really nice and you know I'm just gonna leave it at that I'm feeling a decent two strong eight on this thing transition have you given that album I'll listen if you have tell me what you thought of it did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it what should I review next you're the best forever 
ChDzL7bpI3M,Oh hi everyone sniffing cocaine oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's trying time for a review of the new uncommon NASA album half-way uncommon NASA is a New York rapper producer mr. Paul lavarro he's been at it for many many years at this point however this new decade has brought a recent string of solo releases from mr. NASA over here last year you can check my review I was very impressed with the incredibly grimy poetic and conceptual New York telephone which featured all these very layered textured off-kilter beats some really cool New York inspired lyrical themes and song concepts a spoken-word ish flow very cool vocal and featured guests as well as a series of interviews with people who appeared on the album talking about their experiences in New York as artists and just you know humans now a lot of these same characteristics show up on this new record as well however the concept is very different from what New York telephones concept was on this new record over here the theme is death the interviews that work themselves in between these tracks are really just kind of solo musings of Paul's or podcast type conversations with his significant other in these conversations these monologues kind of glide us from one section of the album to the next and NASA's flow and delivery and lyrical style is pretty much the same if it didn't want his previous few projects it's not really gonna wow you here although I'm not saying that that's necessarily a bad thing for me I like his lyrical style I like his flow style it intrigues me as much here as as on his previous few records and Paul does give us some cool song ideas on this thing like on the title track we're lyrically Paul kind of paints the human race is a series of ticking down clocks with an unknown halfway point I like the lyrics on the song cold like a where I guess in a way NASA kind of further paints his lone-wolf life status and kind of paints the cold as like a friend a family member how turning on the he makes the cold go away and and being warm is more lonely than actually being cold where the cold is is there like a brother there's a track here as well where he's rapping about dreams and sleep and fear of sleep and how sleep in one second you could dream an entire lifetime and which reality is the real or the better reality and I actually loved the ending of this song to how it ends with his name being shouted so then he wakes up from that dream which makes the song over lyrics like I hope your bed is comfortable but not so much that you don't get up from it I thought really struck me as fine and we have a few conceptual detours that don't directly deal in the death theme of this record kind of like on song pipe dreams where Paul pulls together this really odd description of like a I don't know a hip-hop underground Club wet dream where graffiti artists from the late 70s are are spray-painting everywhere and people can't find the venue and people have beepers and there's a coat check that nobody uses it's pretty funny pretty absurd and then later in the album we get a cut where Paul is rapping about how he doesn't watch the news anymore which is directly deal in the existentialist themes of a lot of the songs here but he does take issue with how the news media exploits death for its benefit I guess the one thing that does get to me about this song though is that it doesn't really have that strong of a beat or that song of the structure or anything like that and lyrically it just feels like a more of a rant than it does a song however the track does at least glide us into the next track where we're living in these dark times and NASA is rapping about Eric garner and how Lucy should never be a reason to die and just the kind of tragedies that that kicked off this whole black lives matter movement very recently this album gets pretty sentimental on the closer where Paul is wrapping it away directly to his wife and talking about how his music is their children that is literally what this song is about how his love for her their relationship together the fact that they help each other if none of that had happened this music wouldn't be there so throughout this record Paul dives into a lot of very heavy personal interesting themes however I do have an issue generally with this album and it's pretty much with the production black Tokyo's production to be specific black Tokyo being the guest producer that NASA brought on to this project to pretty much do every beat here and there's just not much about the beats on this record that I care for other than that they are kind of minimalist and stark and allow for the lyrical themes of this album to really impact in a supreme way but outside of that I find the beats on here to be kind of just thinking about him honestly I guess issue number one that I have with these beats are the drums I think the drum sounds are just so flat synthetic and inappropriate for the really organic and and rootsy and chilling and just very real topics being talked about in these lyrics not only do I find the drum sounds to be really weak and kind of take away from what's going on here lyrically but I think a lot of the grooves that are being played are super super stiff almost as if just the drums are a little too quantized to the point where the the groove kind of gets stale and loses flavor as the song moves along then there are the samples and a lot of the melodies that are worked into these tracks sometimes they're pretty decent but a lot of the time they're so faint and so hidden and so packed away into the background that they really don't add that much to the song the Bjork sample on the song skin tells stories is okay I like the kind of tedious groove and and bass on the song about the news on this thing it kind of feels like a ticking clock and in a really interesting way the instrumental embodies the frustration that I often feel myself having with 24-hour news networks but outside of that between the drums between these incredibly faint samples especially on tracks like clown car which to me are one of the most barren songs on the entire record these instrumentals don't really leave me with a whole lot to grab on to musically I'm just kind of left to enjoy the lyrics which I do but I just wish there was a stronger more dramatic musical component coming through on these instrumentals there's even that one instrumental behind living in these dark times that samples epitaph from King Crimson but the sample doesn't even properly line up with the drums it's almost as if the melody isn't really complementing what's going on with Paul's flow all that well it's like that weird little musical sample is just totally out of sync with the drums and loops on an offbeat so it never really properly feels like it's in the groove of the song all that tightly it's unfortunate because lyrically I think this album has a lot of good things going for it and conceptually as well I'm just not really into these instrumentals much of the time unfortunately I feel like at their best they're just kind of doing the bare minimum of what you would want a hip-hop instrumental to do still I don't think it takes away so much from the album that it's not enjoyable I still did come away from this album liking it a lot I'm feeling a light 7 on this thing transition have you given this record of listened if you have did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I

tvavZJRfxH8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new game album the documentary 2.5 now if you saw my previous review for the games the documentary to the highly anticipated sequel record to his big breakout album the documentary about 10 years ago that album was released you may have noticed that it was a collaborative review with a fellow YouTube music reviewer mr. Luke James now we are going to be discussing this sequel to the sequel documentary 2.5 here in this review as well because you know we discussed the documentary too we thought we would come together again and discuss the documentary 2.5 so yeah just going to take you straight into it transition and here we are get the magic of the internet for the second time and not too long just very recently we did the first initial segment for this documentary review series and now he is back again mr. Luke James you can check out his YouTube channel down in the description we're going to be having a discussion about the second part of this sequel album from famed West Coast rapper the game so to start off what were your general thoughts of this record and how do you think it compared to the documentary - I actually liked two-point-five better than the first one I think this one the first half of it is fantastic like the first 10 tracks I was on board with it it seemed like he had a little bit more direction with what he was trying to do then on the first the first documentary - but around the halfway mark it did start to fall off a little bit I didn't like the last half of that record too much but those first 10 songs man I thought they were just great I liked a lot of those songs I mean if you're going to kind of leave it there I'll I'll pick it up and say I agree with you um actually in a lot of ways this is everything that I kind of wanted the documentary to to be not only do I agree that the first 10 tracks are great but the thing is that they're great not only because they're good songs and I think they had that really fantastic modern illustrious production good features as you said kind of focus and direction he's going into these song with serious topics but the documentary too it hinted toward being really cinematic and kind of having a bit of a story to it with some tracks here and there not all the tracks but some tracks here and there kind of linking into one another concept wise or story wise or the beach segues in some kind of way and on this new record over here pretty much every single track does that now regardless of whether or not you like the song the album tells a really coherent I'm not going to say story because there's no real story arc but you know there's there's a lot of kinship and there's a lot of cohesion between these tracks unlike documentary 2 there's not really any moment where it feels a game is making any kind of unnecessary commercial concessions or compromises in order to have a track or two on the record that might sound trendy the first half of the record as I was saying is really beautiful really cinematic really dramatic really instrumentally dense beats reminds me a little bit of dr. Dre's a recent Compton record and of course documentary 2 and the whole second half of the record I kind of liked it a lot as well tons of beats on this side that are a bit of a defunct throwback there were a few hooks here and there that I didn't care for but the second half of the album felt like it had a distinctly different personality from the first half of the record and I liked that for the final few tracks I think he glided it into sort of a really personal and emotional finish really well I think this album has an excellent flow to it and even the songs that are some of my least favorites in the track listing here I didn't even really mind them that much I didn't really find myself skipping past them or anything like that and the features overall I think did a better job of claimed to gain strengths then they did on documentary too you did have those appearances like future and like Kanye who sort of seemed like they were off in la-la land or just kind of doing their own thing that you would expect from them on their own records whereas the people who you would expect would be out of place here people like a ty dolla sign or even Skrillex for example actually you know really compliment game very well and I don't really think sonically or ideologically there's any real hitches on this record um overall I kind of like the skits too I think games pitched vocals at the end of gangbang anyway maybe went a little long I thought the sex skit was kind of funny I thought the radio DJ on this album while it is a bit of a cliche was worked in really well he actually interacted with the music he had a few funny things to say here and there maybe hearing his kids talking on like father like son felt a little rehearsed sort of like they were reading off a script or something but even that track came off really heartfelt and and personal I was really surprised by this record and not that it's a night and day difference with documentary too because I like that record I think documentary 2 is good but again I think 2.5 was really everything I wanted from - and and aside from a few moments here and there that I don't care for I don't have a whole ton of complaints yeah for me like I said the first half I liked much better I found some of the features on the second half didn't really do too much for me like he had a lot of guys on there who aren't overly popular and I understand he wanted to bring that West Coast flavor and bring some of these more underground guys on to sort of fill out the back end but I felt like the verses didn't they didn't do too much for me some of these Posse cuts I wasn't expecting the greatest lyricism but it's just more that typical gangbang and shit so I like to comedy stare act like a little violence for example you don't really care for a moment of violence I didn't like that one very much I liked what they were going for it was sort of a fuck the police anthem but the features on there they didn't do a whole lot for me I would have liked to have had a full verse from John Connor cuz I think John Connor is an upcoming MC who is going to be fantastic once he really gets his chance to you know put out a great album he's put out some good mixtapes in the past and I feel like he was underutilized on that song then there was what was it called my flag and the homies yeah that one I didn't I couldn't get into that one too much it was a bit all over the place with all the extra people that were tacked on there but I did like that Battlecat produced track the one with ty dolla sign is it up on the wall yeah he was called yeah I liked that one a lot it had that classic g-funk sound and it was good to hear from DJ Battlecat again cuz I haven't seen on anything for quite a while maybe I haven't been looking in the right places but he's one of those guys who has been producing for the West Coast for a long time he's produced for a lot of people's favorite artists and the same thing goes for Fredrik who was on this record as well he produced 80s and cocaine he was on that one and he I liked how he had the since going on there on the end of it and that was one of my favorite tracks man Crenshaw and 80s and cocaine it just had that black dynamite sound to it a sort of blaxploitation feel and game was spitting some nice buyers on there I thought he sounded hungry on that one but he did say some funny shit on there like he always does when he was talking about how he's gonna get a prostitute to cut your throat open and then get the police to beat you up and then he's gonna get you raped in jail I was like damn game that's a little bit excessive but you know he's talking about his enemies that's what he wants to do but that track was one of my favorites I really liked magnus carlsen even though I had no clue what that was I had to look up what magnus carlsen was because only Magnus I know is alter Magnus from transformers and magnus carlsen to me sounded like an expensive watch or maybe a fancy car I had no clue what it was but apparently it's a chess master from Sweden or Norway I forget where he's from but I thought that was sort of a cool idea because that song with Anderson Park it's all about gang warfare and how it's sort of like a chess game and the ups and downs and the different moves that go on and how people are affected and that's what I liked a lot about documentary 2.5 is I feel like game he went a little more in-depth into the gang banging ideas like on gangbang anyway we got some great verses from j-rock and schoolboy q I thought they all killed that track and the production was very dynamic too there was a lot of stuff happening there was building up and breaking down and they really went into you know they brought some nice imagery about what happens when people are gangbang and he's talking about people being in wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs and just the awfulness that comes with it but how people are going to do it anyway because some people are trapped in that lifestyle and that's sort of what they get into and it's not easy to get out of there so I thought that was a cool track where it wasn't so much that they were glorifying it at least I didn't feel that way I felt they kind of went into detail about why people gangbang why it happens and game went on to explain the Crips and the Bloods just the Origin's and all that so I thought that was a very cool track and those first couple of songs really set this record off for me yeah I mean gangbang anyway not only is stunning because of those lyrics but the instrumental on that one is probably one of the most dynamic of all the instrumentals on the entire record especially with those really tightly wound strings on the track and I do agree with you not only on the lyrics on this cut but a lot of the lyrics of the first half of the record where he's dealing with these violent themes he really dives below just the kind of general a really cold-blooded brutality and nastiness that you typically expect from a game record he really goes into some of these topics but I think where he goes in even deeper in a sense at least is on the next track from Adam and not only do you see a big difference in what he typically does lyrically but what he's doing kind of emotionally in his David is delivery on this track too on this track he gets super personal he gets super vulnerable in a way and he's just pulling a lot of emotional skeletons out of the closet not only with you know his upbringing and just kind of you know his lifestyle but also his relation to people like Suge Knight and just you know is a history in the industry too which I thought was really crazy you know because because usually when he's on about that stuff it's usually the type of thing that sort of seems a bit again get addressed in the intro track here where you know you just kind of has this really boring setup going on whereas ok with whatever happened with you in G unit or you know like like we haven't sort of heard a story that deals with this like a million times from game before and I just thought it was going to just be like one more annoying shot or just kind of one more annoying reference to something that he just cannot put down but at the end of the track I feel like he went into the next song by telling us he can't necessarily get rid of his past you know this is something that's always going to kind of chase him you know you can't erase this history because this history is a part of him it's a part of his life and and I liked that sentiment a lot I think it sort of got the album off to a good start you know that this was going to be a little bit more of a thoughtful record for him yeah from Adam was actually one of my favorite tracks and I was a bit stew eyes with that because I'm not the biggest Lil Wayne fan I'm one of those guys who I've watched all her stuff was good yeah yeah those people who I really liked his older stuff in Carter one and Carter two then around Carter three I kind of you know that one was good too and then I started to lose interest a bit around Kyra four and Beyond but I liked what he did on here I wasn't expecting that at all cuz he just did a bit of a singsong II thing but I thought his tone really matched up well with what game was doing on this track and I found it interesting how he did this track drunk which he's done in the past on some of his other songs and that's why he's got that raspy emotional feel going on he did it on start from scratch and I think the other one was doctors advocate it was called the one with Busta Rhymes and he's like dragging him out of the car and he's drunk cuz it cook the fuck off me something like that don't mind my Canadian accent I know game doesn't sound like that but yeah I like I like that one a lot man Wayne he he shocked me with that one and I think if you had a head of verse on it it wouldn't have fit since it was such a personal song and game went into all kinds of detail he was talking about how when he was shot which a lot of people have already heard that story before but I think this time he went even deeper and he was talking about how you know who all was involved in this and he's even talking about some of his friends and how one of his friends was shot it was just a great track and it surprised me because whenever I see featuring little Wayne I just go oh man what are we going to get is he just going to be auto-tuned crooning on this about all the different ways that he eats vaginas or what is he going to do but he came through and it was good yeah I mean his lyrics matched the tone of the track he sung without auto-tune and he sounded fine and then the just the the delivery that he was singing with again kind of matched the emotion of the song I mean while I guess I do agree with you in a sense that a lot of the lesser-known that turn upon the the latter half of this album may be lyrically I'm not blown away by them I do like the really kind of gruff really in your face and grimy and hardcore delivery that they bring I think they'd at least fit in the song but as far as the more high-profile cases on this record they really bring it I mean j-roc and schoolboy q as I expected they were great Scarface on blast time you seen was really good will.i.am was was great just as he was on documentary to also Busta Rhymes was fine and there's another oh yeah of course how the fuck can I forget nas nas was faithful when when he appeared on the record you know those are pretty much like the biggest features on the record and it seems like you know e forty as well every big name that appeared on here really delivered you know it was interesting because I just thought going into this record it was just going to be a bunch of throw aways and it feels like so much more of a focused you know version of what we got on documentary too I absolutely agree but you left out one name and I gotta bring him up a personal favorite of mine DJ Quik I know look man I know this song like lyrically I'm not going to say it's a masterful track it's just game topic it's a super vulgar track and I can't say I cared for the song lyrically but DJ Quik to me suck out more is just a producer credit you know that he did a lyricist on the track and and while I agree with you made this on one my favorite songs here I think that song did a great job of sort of setting the tone for the whole second track second half of the record because that after that song follows a bunch of other songs that have a similar classic g-funk 5 yeah that was one of my favorites just because I like DJ Quik a lot and that beat sounded like it was fresh off one of his old albums it could have been put right on balance and options and I thought the hook was nice on there too with the singing even though it was kind of funny I hope you giving it a day whatever that guy would think like that kind of made me laugh but the overall feel of it just had that summertime barbeque music type of vibe that you could just turn it on probably not at a family reunion I don't think you try it on there but had some of your people together just having a barbecue having some beers that's that's the vibe it head and I like that one a lot and another one that I liked on here was life that came near the end and it kind of reminded me of those tracks that Drake does he doesn't sound like Drake but you know how he does those songs where it's just one long verse and he's just letting off about everything like the 34 30 freestyle say what's real I feel like that's what game kind of did here because it's just one long verse and he kind of ties the album together he talks a bit about his family and some of the things going on in his life and that Whitney Houston sample on there was real smooth so I really like that track a lot as well um yeah me and other than that I just don't really have too many complaints about this thing uh you know I I do have my reservations as well with with my flag like you said but not so much with the first half of the track I think once they kind of developed into the homies and started to kind of acapella do that verse and then the beat came in I think it just took a little bit too much time to do what it was going to do and the momentum just kind of went absolutely nowhere but when the divine actually did reduction okay come again oh sorry I said it was just a six minute DJ mustard production and I he makes all right beats every once in a while but a lot of the time you just I don't know that that one was probably my least favorite on there I didn't care for outside too much either that one was actually produced by a Travis Barker which was kind of strange to see his name on there but I thought that that beat just sounded like a knock off cheap DJ mustard style production so those were some of the songs on the later end that I didn't really care for too much as well as moment of violence like you mentioned earlier yeah it's true I I do think that the production on outside did suffer a little bit it's been kind of interesting to see Travis Barker's name turn up more and more here and there on some hip-hop records which again it's it's happening more often I mean it's happening now and it's never really happened before and the mean there at least I'm thinking of a there's also that new run the jewels record that he appeared on not too long ago I think his drum playing sure appeared in the production on one cut from that record and he may have production on another album that might be slipping by nine the at the moment but but again it's only wasting his main term up yeah it's been interesting seeing his name turn up but I can't say this beat really floored me but you know I did kind of admire how this track and my flag to at least sort of added to the old-school character of the second half here I feel like recently we've been seeing a this string of albums that have been getting a lot of critical praise that sort of take us back to the early days of boom bap and and and stuff like that however I feel like we haven't really seen sort of a jeep funk component you know to kind of answer what the you know the East Coast revivalists are doing um you know even from the relevant names that are there on the West Coast right now you know like TDE but but game sort of seems to be bringing it back in a way that I don't know a younger artist could because he seems so much more in touch with that era than a lot of uh you know younger people um so as a result I think the second half of this record sonically goes over pretty well even if it's not as amazing lyrically as the first half of the album and yeah I mean outside of that I think I just want to say some of my favorite tracks off here uh I love Crenshaw total banger I think that the second half of the song glides in really nicely which was a change of pace from the documentary two tracks where you did kind of have those songs that transitioned at some point but they didn't go over quite as gracefully gangbang anyway the ghetto from Adam last time you seen was pretty good and a lot of those party tracks on the second half we're fine too outside and quicks groove are probably too my favorite up on the wall first half of my flag it's just tons of tracks off of this thing that I thought were really good and life as you were saying I thought that was a really significant emotional moment on the record even if songwriting wise I just kind of wish it was a little bit longer and felt like a more grander of a statement to kind of finish the album off because it really does feel like a big album it's a very big personal dramatic multifaceted and sort of cinematic album you know not only with the lyrics are you getting a lot of really vivid imagery but also with all these very cool sound effects that bring us from one song to another kind of happen in the middle of these songs that really make a lot of the topics talked about in the lyrics uh come to life yeah I wanted to come back to the ghetto right quick I thought I really liked NAS his first first on that when he went into detail about how you know there's a lot of poverty and suffering around the world who even mentioned some of the stuff that was going on in Europe I thought that was just kind of different he's talking about ghettos all over the place not just you know what goes on in the United which a lot of people kind of just focus on that I thought that was interesting also uh last time you seen I didn't hate that track but it definitely wasn't one of my favorites I am a big Scarface fan I loved his last album and I think he had a good verse on here but I'm just kind of tired of all the Tupac like mysticism like when's the last time you saw Tupac I looked in the mirror and I saw Tupac adjust some of that stuff was a little bit cheesy to me but I do appreciate the sentiment because you know he's obviously a West Coast legend and game wanted to you know do something for him so I get that but it felt a little bit forced at times for me I guess I guess part of the reason I like the track is that it did not go over as badly as I think it could have uh you know I definitely had me hesitating when I first started hearing those refrains at the start of the track about you know when's the last time you seen two pockets on and so forth and and I do agree with you uh the the latter part of the song where he said uh you know I saw him in the mirror was really corny um and maybe kind of that vocal cut right before Scarface's verse took a little bit too long and you know did kind of cool down the momentum of the song a little bit but once game really started rapping a kind of the passion that he had on from Adam and gang-related really continues on to this track and I think his heartfelt delivery really just kind of made it for me and Scarface definitely matched his energy and um yeah the song felt um I guess more like it had a very strong personal connection to the subject matter you know more than it did with a lot of other artists who might just kind of casually mention Tupac in their songs yeah I can agree with that because what Scarface on there I think that added a lot of credibility if you will to the track because Scarface obviously worked with ku pop and in his verse he does talk a little bit about the relationship and he actually talks about the last time that he talked to him before he died so I thought that was pretty cool but the overall beat and all that it didn't it didn't blow me away wasn't the trash track by any means it wasn't one of my favorites but another one I did like that we didn't mention is gang related that one kind of reminded me of summertime off a disc one it had that nostalgic feel to it and it was really smooth I like the vocals on there from Asia I think her name was Dan game goes into the typical gang bang and shit it's more the same lyrically and sometimes it does get a bit repetitive when he's just saying I've seen some crazy shoot mode new goo and he says that multiple multiple times over and over but the overall sound of that song I really liked it I like the feel the beat and he kind of took us back with that one I thought mmm all right so overall I have to say I'm really enjoying this record I'm definitely feeling like a strong seven to like eight on this thing certainly more impressed with it than I was with documentary two of no tracks that I would say were throwaway you know maybe some moments I didn't really care for as much as others but there really was nothing on here that I thought was a bad move for game unlike with documentary - what are you feeling about the the record overall score wise I have this one at a four out of five there were really only two or three tracks that I really didn't like I didn't like my flag the homies moment of violence and outside but they weren't so bad like if I just had the CD playing and they came on I wouldn't be diving - press fast forward but they just they weren't as good to me as the first half the first half really spoiled me I remember when I started listening to this to work on this review I was thinking myself is he have to give us a classic with this shit because the first 10 tracks were just nuts and I couldn't believe that this was the second disc like the first disc was pretty good but then they come through with the second disc and - started off so damn smooth that was crazy so I think the latter end just kind of fell off a little bit for me but it still had some good moments like life I really liked that one a lot so four out of five for me on this disc yeah I mean I was definitely feeling the same the same way for a second like oh man are we going to get like you know like a classic on this one and and not that I don't think people could maybe take this record down that direction into the future but I do enjoy where he ended up taking it in the middle of the album but he kind of broke it up gave us that interlude and that just sort of went in another direction even if that interlude did go on a little long I think for him to come through the record that was totally and the mood of the first half I think it would have been a little out of personality for him you know because I think sort of the party tracks and the brutality of the second half is sort of more in line with what you would expect from game but I think it's of at least a slightly higher quality than we're usually getting from him though you know a lot of those bangers on the first disc of of this you know double sequel album are definitely undeniably great and and you know those those same moods turn up on here I'm sure we can talk about this album even more all day but this review is pretty much done it over with this point I'm glad that you know but think like imagine if he took the best 14 or 15 tracks from oh can you imagine if he did that like that that's a big if if my aunt had balls she'd be my uncle's but she doesn't so she's my aunt but if he took the best tracks I think it would have been a classic man this could have been an album of the year discussion possibly but this is what he wanted to do I think it's a very strong double disc and I don't think he could have done too much better because think about some of your favorite artists even if they were to put out that many tracks and not only is this a double disc but it's damn near 40 tracks this is going to double this that's like 25 tracks or something like that it's two full disc so I think he did a great job yeah I mean you know averaging out these two records for me you know that's like a seven out of 10 or something and you know hip hop artists both young and old you know there aren't many that are going to drop 40 tracks and overall the project is going to come out that good you know he's just dropped so much material this year for us and and and it's really came through you know he just really had a fire in his belly and a lot of focus on these two projects and I think that this album should definitely I don't know maybe probably serve as a reminder you know if it's not going to become a classic definitely serve as a reminder for us to maybe go into sequel records with a bit less skepticism this is definitely one of the better sequel records and there's more that you hear that Puff Daddy is doing a sequel to Puff Daddy and family I don't really feel that give me about that one maybe that's the meaning of all this happening yes you can't bring that up right after I said hey we're going to be sceptical and the sequel records from now on then you bring that up Thanks my bad my bad I'm going to be putting my foot in my mouth after that it comes out yeah I don't think that one's going to be too good but we'll see what happens with that all right I want to thank Luke James again for coming on and talking with me for all this time about these two game records and for sure we're probably going to see him popping up on us more hip hop reviews into the future I'm going to leave a link to his YouTube channel down in the description where again you can check out his reviews he's dropping reviews of new hip hop records all the time thanks for coming on man thanks a lot man I appreciate it and a problem forever

what you're most notoriously known for are a series of very dry blunt straightforward and kind of well mannered food reviews where you talk about a lot of a I guess the latest fast food stuffs and also some things that kind of pop up in the freezer aisle what went about did you start doing that on on YouTube alright now I first started with the Channel four years ago in June 2011 but that just started with with energy drinks and you know the channel now is known for the food reviews so I first got the idea to do the food of youth in September of 2011 but I didn't really initiate anything until probably late December early January of 2012 and from there I just tried out you know I started reviewing McDonald's took a little break and I really kept the food reviews going for good probably late 2012 so so a lot of these energy drinks a lot of this fast food that you're covering I mean it's it's pretty common a lot of the food and it's very easy access for a lot of people I mean a lot of people even prior to even seeing a review of something that you've that you've that you're talking about I've probably eaten some of this food themselves you know what sort of draw you to drew you to feel as if you know you needed to just kind of express yourself on on this fast food I mean is in some kind of way to connect with fellow food fans or maybe maybe heighten the standards of the food that that you're reviewing in these videos and maybe kind of send a message to some of the people selling this food that it could be of higher quality or maybe give them a bit of a nod when they do end up doing something good right the reason why I first started branching out into the food reviews is because when you think about it you know energy drink reviews yeah a lot of people you know they do drink energy drinks but not everyone does it targets a certain group of people whereas with food you figure alright well not everyone needs an energy drink to survive but everyone's got to eat at some point or another and a large number of people at least in you know areas where they probably be watching youtube videos would have at least some sort of popular fast or frozen food here and there now as for you know I'll try to review some new items when they come out but at the same time I used to reduce some classics like you know the Big Mac from McDonald's something that probably everyone's had or most people had before watching that video already but the reason why did items such as that was number one for the very small percentage of people who said I've never had a Big Mac let me see what review brought things about it first and some saying that's everyone because I highly doubt it but another reason is just to add another opinion to that someone might say you know I'm kind of noticing that we're going to pick on the Big Mac today the Big Mac from McDonald's is kind of tasting you know maybe taste different nowadays let me look online and see what people have to say about it you know hook up and I'll see a sea of voices and that's another voice to contribute and help people figure out you know if they have any questions or ideas or inquiries about any sort of item so in a sense you kind of see yourself as doing a bit of a service like you're doing a bit of a watchdog thing for your for your audience yeah it could be I could be the you know the figurative royal taster you know going ahead of everyone else and just you know taking a little signal toe in the water and just seeing seeing how it is and you know I'll try maybe some burger and you know if I end up you know rolling on the floor throwing up after I eat it you know make sure that to everyone said they wouldn't have to put themselves through that misery unwillingly well if I'm correct there's actually a review you had done in the past or you had mentioned before you even walked into wherever you were buying this food there was some kids throwing up outside yeah yeah I think I do I did remember that one yeah and that didn't even serve as a warning to you you just bravely walked in there anyway yeah I just figured you know it is what it is as I'll say from time to time and and I just said hey if he's thrown up you know if need be I'll join the party you know hopefully it was a good burger for the few you know minutes those in my stomach before coming back out again what kind of reviewing really common items like that it can kind of serve as I guess a bit of a UH I don't know a place of reference for a lot of other people because someone can come along see that review and say okay you know I've eaten that so I know where he's at taste wise because we've eaten that same thing yeah you know he didn't like it as much as me he liked it more than me so from there on in I can kind of maybe use that same I guess a bit of a point of reference for when he's reviewing other things in the future that's very true that's very okay and use it as a reference point also another another point of reference that I think is in your reviews something that we've all had before that you reviewed recently you I you did a water review yes is actually one of my favorite drinks yeah yeah I did do a review of water it was actually a side-by-side taste test oh it was a full-blown taste tattoos as I called it a battle of the brand it was a single brand like as a battle of the brand and set them up side by side it was do something I've actually kind of jokingly said I wanted to do since even 2011 when I was reviewing you know just energy drink so saying you know wouldn't that be something if one day I just reviewed a glass of water and now I said I figures you know let me go all out this time you know I was kind of feeling it I kind of was kind of looking at this jug of water and I said you know I don't know I guess I got a feeling I kind of want to review this tonight so I got another one set him up and reviewed water you know if I ever get really short on on ideas or things to review I should just go out on a full-out water reviewing series well any any future water reviews I would recommend if there was one shortcoming about the review I think it should have probably been a blind taste test because I think I think you know the distilled water the spring water I think maybe some of your inherent bias toward the one water that you did pick might have seeped through just because you didn't know you knew which one you were drinking before you went into it yeah we'll keep that for the next one please do please do all right so aside from a you know these more common items where you know more people have tried them so you know they can kind of be this point of reference for you for your audience what else drives you to try other newer fast food items because there's a lot coming out every day and I imagine there's a lot that you end up passing over I mean if there's one recently that was introduced that I think I noticed you that you haven't done a review of it's those Taco Bell whatever delights that are kind of like they're like little munchkins and apparently they have Captain Crunch like Captain Crunch berries like sprinkled on the outside they look pretty horrifying so I don't totally blame you for avoiding them but you know I know you've reviewed Taco Bell items before so it kind of strikes me as something that you might have touched down on her Lisa had been aware of right the reason why you know I I'm kind of I get selective in the things that I try have nowadays is I kind of plan things out I mean lately I've been able to greatly expand my horizon to what I I want to review by going out and doing these you know in public reviews I started putting up lately over the past month or so by doing that you've been changing up the setting by hopping up in the car yes yeah I've been I've been you know doing some reviews in the car and I've also actually gone down to some different places and actually just sat at the table at that locale and reviewed a product there normally I used to just be confined to what I would call it my my reviewing edifis reviewing chamber and I historically call it and in doing that I kind of have to review things alright it's nearby I can get it I could bring it back and it's not going to be cold but now I'm branching out I'm able to just expand the horizon really be able to try new things but even then when you have everything open like that you still might wonder alright he was able review say the Halloween whopper from Burger King you know why should I try I am deathly afraid of that black bun yes it is intimidating it is intimidating but you know you can say he reviewed that why didn't he try out this Taco Bell thing and the reason being is just because I got to have the way I planned things out you know sometimes I'll take a break here I'll take a break there of the voted day to doing the the vor W podcast broadcast YouTube video of whatever you'd like to call that and off-the-plan everything and not weeks in advance usually I'll just go week by week I'll say alright you know Thursday I'm going to go out and review this Saturday I'm going to review this energy drink and I'll kind of plan it out and by the time I get all that done an item which may have been relevant you know a few weeks ago by the time it would come to review that it may may everyone may have already you know kind of tried that and conflicting with what I said earlier about the items everyone's tried this is focusing mostly for the newer items for limited edition items you know the items that are going to be here for a few weeks and then they're going to just go away you know because then if I try it put the review up and by the time it's up it's already off the menu you know it would still be a video but it wouldn't necessarily be informative because really with the channel what I want to do is both inform and entertain to give people my thoughts views opinions on a product that I'm reviewing and hopefully make it mildly bearable to view at the same time I mean a lot of where exactly do you think the the entertainment factor comes in with your videos is it kind of in your demeanor is it in your delivery and your bluntness kind of your dry sense of humor because a lot of your videos they don't necessarily work up to the same I guess aesthetics of a lot of other popular YouTube videos I mean most of your videos are in one take and it's it's just a very intimate just kind of low-key setting much of the time and you know there's no bells and whistles or anything like that it's pretty much just you a lot of the time you know trying the food in real time and giving us the opinion that you're coming up with sort of on the fly yeah yeah I always a always film the review in just one take no real editing policy so if something happens I remember and one of you I just spilled the glass of water everywhere and just got off camera cleaned it up and kept it rolling the whole time but I think the real thing that that I think is an entertainment aspect I probably say two things definitely is what kind of appeal to people number one just the whole setting you know I I can't say how many other I mean it's got to be some I know for a fact there's some there has to be but I wouldn't say with a massive amount of individuals on YouTube wearing what many would consider their you know their quote Sunday best to review a hamburger so I think that whole scene and just the setting in the scenario and even just how it's filmed is one thing that my people might maybe scratch their heads and say you know what what is this and kind of check it out investigation so you know right off the bat you're you're fully aware of just how I guess I guess you could say to put it nicely out of place you are in the modern era that's the only uh and and you're just kind of out there totally accepting it and you're thinking that you know as much as it is you you realize that to your average person it seems kind of odd and that it might attract them to the videos oh yes now I know that I'm not you know not like the average Joe on the street you know I know that and you know I just as I always say just do me and I just embrace you know how I am what I wear you know what I do and you know I just say I am what I am I do what I do and it is what is um while you do feel like that now I'm sure that there probably is a point in time maybe when your YouTube channel is first starting to gain traction and and you probably did uh you know catch quite a bit of flak from some online users oh yeah who you know thought that maybe how you dressed was dorky or however you want to put it I'm sure that's probably one of the nicer ways to put it I'm sure you've seen much much worse online and in your YouTube comments so I mean you know this this position this feeling that you have now I guess this kind of comfort that you have in your own skin is this uh you know always kind of how you felt or you know has been on YouTube kind of thicken your skin a little bit you know really it thickened my skin a lot I really I guess had the Epiphany that you know I am how I am and I'm alright with it I probably had that in early 2013 when you know the the pan pizza review was posted on reddit was spreading to a few other websites it kind of went viral in a sense you know it got 300,000 views in just a matter of days that's how the whole channel really blew up it was a sudden sudden explosion you know if you will just based off of that one review yeah off that one review and then it kind of spread around and from there that just started growing and and that's where where everything started but before that you know I was operating for almost two years previous I only had about maybe 200 subscribers so at that time there weren't too many people commenting too many people giving you criticism or constructive criticism or whatever you'd like to call it there weren't too many people doing that so I was kind of just before then in my own little world kind of others doing my own little saying more I guess it wasn't as self-aware you know as as I am now after that seeing you know the comments it's taken my skin a lot and instead of saying you know look at what all these people are saying I got a ditch to suits I got to change my hairstyle blah blah blah I just accepted it and I said you know I am how I am and that's all there is to it well well you accepted it but also you know it seems like it was a bit of an onslaught of negativity that you certainly worked through and you continued and you didn't allow it to stop you but um you know for for a great deal of time up until very recently you weren't allowing comments on a lot of your videos obviously because of a lot of that negativity that pops up and just you know the general trolls and all that kind of stuff but but as I just said your your policy on that has changed very recently so you know what what is the change recently been that that you know you're just kind of feeling like I should allow comments you know because I know that you've sort of interviewed your fans and asked your fans personally uh you know if they would like comments to be open and and you know they said yes but you know that's kind of been a resounding opinion for a while so you know something else had to have changed other than just you know your viewers wanted comments oh yeah it's always been you know no denying that it was difficult at times you know just having to deal with all that and the comments they were they were blocked almost from for probably about over two years before I finally unblocked them and the reason I did that was because I number one in that two years I kind of you know learned a lot about the YouTube community in that time I had time to kind of build up you know get a thicker skin realized that what the people are saying doesn't doesn't really you know if the negativity doesn't really matter and the most important thing that I would do to really get a grasp on where things would stand with the comments was probably every every five or six months when they were disabled I would on some random video that upload maybe a review here and there instead of blocking the comments I'll leave them as I guess approved where look like comments were open so people who saw the video would comment but wouldn't show up instead of go to to filter not be able to see the comments and approve or not approve them and in doing so I wouldn't approve any of them but I'd be able to read what the community would be saying as if I had comments open on this video sure so give me good feedback on where things to you know if it was if it was tons of people saying you know you know fu blah blah blah I might have so scratched my head and I might have said you know well do I really want to have this up or if it was you know some good feedback some criticism there's always going to be some criticism and and the haters as some call there's always going to be that online but if it's you know kind of like a balanced sounds percentage for each that make me think otherwise and over time I began seeing that kind of change where it was more people who which is genuinely interested in the reviews just enjoying the videos you know giving feedback suggestions for what could be reviewed and overall I began to see kind of a change and how that was I began thinking and I also feel like you know be I guess I had the vor W show where I would read fan mail and respond to it but some people aren't willing to sit through you know a 50 minute video to to hear their letter responded to you know and I thought you know having the comments enabled with seeing how the community was changing would also be a nicer way to be able to connect with the community let subscribers and viewers interact directly with each other and give suggestions directly to me without having go through a hassle you know an email or a YouTube message and don't allow me to directly respond to them so over time and after having built up a thicker skin I finally came to the probably August of 2015 when I said you know I'm going to put comments up on a few reviews I did that and whose overwhelmingly positive and I thought I smoked after that didn't really make you know didn't publicize that I was bringing back the comments I just did it spur the moment I thought you know now I'm just going to see how people feel about it if people support the decision tonight when I made that poll I already pretty much figured what the majority was going to be but I wanted to see the ratio between the people who fully wanted the comments back the people who wanted them kind of approved or the people who didn't want them back and it was a great turnout and obviously the overwhelming majority wanted the comments back and and back they are you know I I'll check the comments out you know I look at them but it's it's nowhere near nowhere near is bad or maybe that's the wrong way of saying it maybe just my skin is thicker now and what I might have perceived as insults back in the day you know in 2013 or so now I just kind of I'm able to immediately discard that isn't rolling you know and so forth well also you know once you hear certain insults over and over and over and I again it just up happen same effect anymore like yeah doesn't and it kind of gets old and and and after a while the insults kind of become a form of entertainment and it's like god that's all you could come up with like ever than a hundred times yeah oh yeah oh yeah you're used to it you know no big deal sure sure sure so despite this hate despite the trolls despite you know this influx of viewers on that one particular video that kind of blew your channel up in a sense and and maybe brought a lot of negativity for a short amount of time this wave of negativity in the midst of all of that you did manage to grow what seems like a pretty passionate fan base I mean when you did allow comments again I mean a I noticed on those first initial videos where you started a allowing comments it seemed like and then I don't know if you were moderating them please you know let me know but it's it seems like everybody in the comments was on their best behavior and anybody who is saying something slightly negative you know it's like hey shut up you know we got comments again just you know cut this cut the crap they want him to take comments away you know it seemed like you know not only that but it seemed like everybody was really encouraging and appreciative and uh you know really happy not only that you allowed comments but you know it's it seemed like they just wanted to genuinely express uh their enjoyment for uh for what you do oh yeah yes yes the comments really I was actually taken back by how you know how positive it was to and good all could be you know people shed Sanji's they just trying to be on their best behavior but even even still you know on unreviewed and on review that I uploaded last night and so on after comments have been back for well over a month now they're still overwhelmingly good you know now some of the some trolls or whatever might come out now you know when they see our comments back for good but even still you know they're still overwhelmingly good and I think a lot of people are just happy and excited to have the comments back you know some people might have found out about the channel in May of 2013 and all they knew really were just no comments no comments you know and then to finally have that freedom to be able to just express their their views their thoughts their own comments since the name I think really is this a lot of people just like that they're happy about that and you know I really don't really moderate the comments you know every year in here and there I might you know take one thing down but it's not like I I screwed knives every word of every comment and you know I let me take you know ten out of the 20 comments that are up down books out like this you know most of them and just let the stuff stay up and I figure it's the community and you know they can they can say what they want uh and kind of speaking of that community and in the and the positivity amongst the people who really do enjoy what you do I mean it seems like uh there are some people and if I've noticed this from some of whom have taken the time to to write you in email form or in a YouTube message form on your vo RW shows it's it seems like with some people who watch what you do they are enjoying it and they are getting some kind of gratification out of it beyond just simply getting an opinion out of you I mean it seems like that there are some people who similarly like you are kind of old souls in a sense and you know watch what you do and are like wow you know this guy likes to dress in a way similar to me or you even have kids who are emailing you asking you for uh for fashion advice yep yeah the you know I'm just going to say you know I'm not really I'm not super fashionable in 2015 terms you know I don't have whatever that haircut is really they shave the sides and back of their or a head off and then split the top back I don't have that that haircut and the suits I wear are an older style but still people you know not everyone is interested in completely you know slim fit clothing and certain extremely modern styles so some people will come to me for fashion advice and a lot of people as you as you you know really brought on a lot of people just are interested in the channel not just from you know an opinion perspective not just to check out the videos to see what I want to say about this burger because they were interested in and trying that out but some people just watch it because perhaps they just enjoy the setting or you know maybe they just enjoy the videos themselves you know they just legitimate fans will just watch the content or listen to the vo RW just because they have maybe something or other that they they like about the channel itself be it well it's I mean it seems like they're connecting with you on some kind of a personal or ideological level yesterday I imagine it you'll be able to relate maybe to what I what I say in the vrw shows or true even just in a simple tutorial level you know and on how I dress you know I might say hey you know I I wear suits all the time too I never never thought you know anyone else really did this so seriously you know some people will be able to connect on that level too yeah absolutely and I mean and it seems like especially in 2015 you know the style of dress that you indulge in I imagine it would be just a lot of extra work to kind of maintain yeah really um right now it's just because of how long I've been been doing this you know some people will will say to me you know you can't be serious about you know wearing a suit all the time you know this is just like a costume for the videos right now say no you know it's how I dress every day I mean as I speak lifetime I'm going with the you know a vest and tie set you know right now but uh really because I've been I've been dressing this way probably consistently for the past seven years now because I've been doing that for so long it's just more of like something that I'm used to it's not really I sit there at the closet you know in a sinking position staring at this rack of suits for for 30 minutes thinking hmm what suit am I going to wear today you know it's not really like that for me I usually spur the moment though I'm thinking out maybe a chilly day so I'm going to grab this gray suit standard white shirt and maybe a grayish black tie to go with that you know since kind of the Mamas second I'm sure it's second nature you're saying yeah that means me it's always it's always just I guess you'd say and I use this comparison sometimes a lot of times you could think of it the amount of thought that someone puts into picking out a t-shirt and jeans to wear is not too much not usually it's not grab the pair of jeans we have this t-shirt and I'm out of here it's kind of like the same thing with me where I'll just grab the suit grab the shirt grab the time I'm out of here too hmm well I mean it's uh not only with the your style of dress but I think uh also um uh your your accent which I'm very familiar with because I've grown up in New England as well uh you know just also your your manners as well as you know your love of shortwave radio you know I think a lot of people would kind of characterize you as old-fashioned however you know the fast food reviews energy drink reviews you know I know that you've in some videos talked and give given your opinions on newer episodes of The Walking Dead I understand that you may be a gamer as well it kind of seems like you have one foot in the old world but one foot in the new world as well yeah I would I would definitely agree with that and I definitely have many likes and interests that would reflect to a previous era you know probably the way I my accent as you said my interest for shortwave radio the way I dress so all that really does reflect on you know in an earlier time at the same time though you know I've absolutely you know I'm I'm a big fan of The Walking Dead and all the fast food so it's definitely a contrast really between say the the early to mid 1900s and 2015 and I think the result is it's a very interesting combination and there might be another thing that's very interesting to some people to see this this kind of clash you know some people would say he look like a time traveller from 1930 that that popped up in 2015 and here you are so I mean obviously a would you say that your affinity for this older era is so strong that you know if you could be a time traveler you you go back and do it or you know do you enjoy the the amenities of a newer technology too much I mean is is right now the the era you'd rather be living in you know if I if I had the ability I'd probably go I'd probably go back in time maybe for a period of time I wouldn't say I'd go back there and just be stuck forever because I think if I was transported right now back back in time I probably I'd miss the internet I probably go through you know internet withdrawal and you know so I think I think the combination I think it would be interesting to go back and you know see how cope and deal in that in that type of world and in that era hey they had food reviews back then too you probably just have to get a job at the local paper though exactly exactly so so right now really it is an interesting combination because I can still do the things that I enjoy that would strike people as being from a previous era ie shortwave listening in shortwave radio that's still around even as it was around you know 60 70 80 years ago that's still around today and I can still enjoy that today so right now I've been able to find a good balance for myself where I could enjoy the things that may not be as popular as they were back then I could still enjoy those things now and I can still enjoy you know the amenities of of 2015 um to hop into another interest of yours just because I mean you were just talking about a shortwave radio yeah um I have a background in radio myself but you know more am/fm I'm very unfamiliar with the shortwave band and can you maybe give us a little bit of a you know a very short rundown of exactly you know somebody had how someone listens to the to the shortwave and you know what kind of programming people can find on it sure now a shortwave radio lines between where am the am band ends and where the FM band begins there's a space between that and part of that a so there's a big space between a.m. and the FM band either and I know FM but most people aren't even aware of oh yeah yeah there's a massive space between it it's like there's nothing that's between there there is other frequencies between there so from where a.m. ends at 1700 kilohertz all the way until thirty thousand kilohertz is where shortwave is and shortwave you can consider it kind of like AM radio but it's used for many purposes still use that standard analog quality nothing really digital no digital radio really on shortwave the difference between really what makes the difference between shortwave radio and AM radio is a distance at the broadcast travel right standard AM transmitter say a high-powered one might be able to cover say from New York City maybe at night it will be able to cover some of New England some of the mid-atlantic but that's about it whereas a shortwave transmitter from say New York City you'd be able with a given amount of power for the transmitter you'd be able to broadcast all the way to Africa Asia Europe the Middle East and so on someone with a certain receiver in those parts of gold would be able to pick up your broadcast crystal clear that the same amount of power so with the same amount of power someone on a shortwave band gets greater distance than someone on the a.m. bandit let's say there was an AM transmitter with 50 kilowatts that's 50,000 Watts a shortwave transmitter with that same power 50,000 Watts would be able to probably spend a good amount of the globe given the right antenna and other variables but yes with the same same power of each shortwave has a lot greater of a reach now as for the content so you did have a shortwave receiver in which you can buy online and I doubt you could really go into a store house and find one maybe back in Radio Shack was doing good maybe but if you did have a receiver what would you be able to hear you have the good in the bad there's a lot of you know very very you know extreme religious people who use shortwave and some of that can be you know entertaining to hear at the same time though there's also international broadcasters the BBC they have the BBC world service they broadcast on shortwave also and in the afternoons you can hear a broadcast from them so they able to hear news you can actually hear music programs there's one station run by the US government called The Voice of America usually plays a lot of top 40 hit music at times news stations from China you could even hear North Korean propaganda and there's a lot of other programs and different languages sometimes the BBC and this one station of Australia will cover you know soccer games so it has a good variety a lot of stuff that you might find on AM radio some stuff that you wouldn't find on it it all really comes together on shortwave where it targets probably more of an international audience than a local or regional or even national audience and for that even though there aren't too many shortwave listeners around there's still at least probably hundreds of millions of shortwave listeners across the globe there's still a viable audience for this platform and a lot so this isn't necessarily a medium that's like in danger of disappearing no no not yet a lot of governments actually still invest in shortwave in broadcast different programs in different languages in some places the globe especially third world countries shortwave radio is not necessarily listened to for pleasure but it's vital for even survival and you know for people to just get their news potentially life-saving information in places where there is limited infrastructure internet might not yet fully be there or very unstable television is not doing the greatest yet shortwave radio has the ability to reach those places and provide people with information that they may desperately need okay and and and I understand that sort of maintaining or building a shortwave transmitter might be easier or cheaper cheaper than then maintaining an AM or an FM transmitter because I know that you have been trying to pursue doing your own shortwave radio program yourself yeah look the thing with transmitters is you need a sustainable amount of power so if you had you know enough money to start an AM station you could probably start a shortwave one too but you know if you had five hundred dollars in your pocket you really wouldn't be able to start your own station and a lot of stations understand that there's some people who might want to get on the air but I don't have the money to build their own station so they'll actually broker airtime out and they'll say we're charging such and such amount of dollars for an hour broadcast just name what frequency you want to use what areas globe you want to target and we'll hook you up so you'll be able to have you'll be able to be on the air without actually having to build your own station and I was actually able to do that earlier this year I was able to to get in touch with this shortwave station out of Maine called WB CQ and that a great deal for just $20 an hour I was able to buy airtime and actually get a variant of my vor W show on the air and it was heard across the globe across the North American continent and it even made it across the Atlantic Ocean and there were a lot of listeners in the UK also right so did you just sort of hand them an audio file and they broadcast the audio file yep I just made an audio file you know talk for a little bit play some music and then I was able to just put that up on on their Dropbox and from there the people at the station just took care of it hooked it up to the transmitter and I just got it sent that to the world so you can kind of pick where you sort of want it sent and you know it can go in a very broad very wide very far-reaching direction it might understand that as a result a shortwave radio just not I guess regulated in the same way that the a.m. and the FM bands are you know not only when it comes to broadcast range but but playing music as well you know because my time in radio I do understand that there are quite a few regulations not only in relation to broadcast but you know what music you're playing and you know the BMI and having to pay certain fees to license the music that you're playing yeah shortwave radio is uh almost done completely unregulated by the FCC due to the fact that number one just the amount of space that is the amount of frequencies they might have to monitor and number two it's not just domestically but they have signals coming in from all around the globe it would just be the sheer volume of things that have to deal with and look at and examine that for the most part the FCC has really backed off on shortwave I mean as a matter of fact there is probably several hundred shortwave pirate stations in the US which don't have a permit to broadcast but the just transmitted anyways so with that being said the FCC really does not regulate shortwave whatsoever and it really is the epitome of free speech you know really you can probably on the air say and do what you want and it would be little to no consequences of that and so with your broadcast and in the broadcasts of any shortwave station reaching so far and wide and with the FCC not kind of regulating you know which station is taking up which space is there ever a lot of I guess a overlap or a lot of radio interference in relation to some of these programs sometimes there is especially during the the peak broadcasting times for certain area say like in the early to mid evening hours of North America that's when a lot of stations will target the US and Canada and try to broadcast there and at times sometimes they'll accidentally broadcast on the same frequency and the kind of overlap on each other but at the same time to try to coordinate that so it's not just a total mess you know the whole time what those try to do sometimes some of the stations will be in contact with each other so one owner might send the other an email and they'll be able to coordinate schedules and publish them and in the end it'll usually work itself out but at times it can be confusing but they usually work work themselves out because usually with if there is ever a clash between two stations and they're broadcasting on top of each other usually one of them will realize they they'll say you know gosh no one can hear what we're saying we'll move over here and they'll publicize that and they usually sort things out pretty quickly if there's ever a conflict and so as a shortwave enthusiasts you know not only are you dabbling and trying to create some of the programming on this band but also you know as someone who is a listener and a fan of shortwave of you know are you merely just kind of sitting back and listening to the programs and stopping whenever you find something you like or are you constantly just I guess exploring through the whole shortwave band secular hours of the day and just trying to like document what programs are happening where they're coming from what people are saying I'll do a combination of of all three you know a lot of times I'll find a program that I like and I'll stop and I'll listen to it for a while and if it catches my interest I'll people listening if not I'll keep tuning here's what I first do is I scan through the range of frequencies I want to listen to at that time and I'll just do a brief run-through see what's there and then after that looking closer detailed anything that caught my eye and then maybe listen for the duration of the program if I find something good one thing that I can do with shortwave which which I like is and this is also an incentive that some stations will use in order to kind of find out how many people are listening to them if you write them what they call reception report they'll give an email address you'll send them an email send them an email you'll say you know I was listening in you know in New York with this receiver I heard you between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. you were coming in good then you send them an email with this information number one they'll get a good idea of from the amount of emails they get how many people might be listening especially in Western nations or media rich nations with the internet readily available but in return if you were able to provide your contact information and an address they'll usually be able to send you some freebies from the station kind of as a whole token for writing in and the most well-known thing some stations will send they call this a QSL card it's kind of like a little decorative postcard from the station confirming that you know you listened and you know is as it may sound you may say well why would someone want to collect these pieces of paper from these stations and I could say the same thing you know why do people collect baseball cards sometimes sure it's kind of like collecting licensed points or something yeah exactly that so I collect those and I'll write to the station you know see how many I can get and I have them in a binder and everything so you know I do have a collection of those going to such as another little incentive to for me personally to keep listening that's really fantastic um you've been very open about you know your opinions and your personal interests on your YouTube channel but are there any other interests that you know you feel incredibly passionate about that you would feel comfortable sharing that you know you haven't quite broadcast on your your YouTube channel yet you know not that we're expecting you to make a future segment out of anything but I guess are there any kind of pursuits or passions that you have both new or old school you know that sort of haven't made it onto your YouTube channel yet you know thinking about that most the time I am very open with my interests and my passions on YouTube one thing I really don't talk about too much on YouTube and again a lot of the time because of YouTube's own you know regulations and copyright and everything is music I do little hey I'm a big fan of that too oh yeah absolutely here they do the go-to music guy really you argue then you're the leading authority on uh on latest music but really that's one thing I don't talk about too much in too much detail on YouTube because really when you talk about music you know number one you got to know what you're talking about you got to be a professional about it as you are number two some people might want to you know hear the music and sometimes YouTube can be a real pain about that sure but that's one thing that I really did I am in an avid music listener we have has something going music wise if I'm not listening to to the shortwave and then some time really talked about too much I really don't don't really talk about you know what my favorite musical genres are or what songs I heard you don't really go on about that but something that still does you know interest me very much well uh you know obviously a lot of people listening to this podcast on this YouTube channel or big music fans as well what albums or artists have you seen yourself listening to repeated lately you know my favorite genre of music is probably popular music and rock music maybe some alternatives and punk to from the late 90s early 2000s so I probably say what I when I catch myself listening to a lot is Oasis sure oh yeah I'm a big Oasis fan and I listen to some other those those classic groups from the from the air you know Third Eye Blind and of course I'll go back to the in the early 90s um you know Nirvana and even I'll listen to some classic rock to some of those groups are very very talented that's really what I what I listen to the most is this whole mental playlist of all the songs whatever I'm feeling at the time and I usually listen to one and then after that I'll see if I'm what else I'm feeling and I usually do that and by the end of the day I'm fine I've listened to you know 20 songs or more you know it's a it's pretty interesting not only that you bring up that air and I recently did a classic review that will be coming out during a future classic review segment of Nirvana's in utero which is one of the most intense records an album that I really like but also talking about Third Eye Blind it's funny because I had that debut album of theirs when it originally came out and when that album dropped I mean it was really an era of CDs you know when cassettes were kind of on the way out yet and right now and I don't know if this is something you have any interest in you know maybe you're maybe this is a part of more of your modern tastes you know and I use CDs and mp3s as well but you know now we're in the midst of it I guess a bit of a vinyl revolution or something you know and apparently the vinyl market has grown just as big as the digital music market in a lot of ways and and I was in a record store the other day and I had seen that debut Third Eye Blind record reissued on vinyl which you know to me was just kind of on a sort of sort of ridiculous I mean I liked and I think vinyl records are great and I think you know a lot of great music that was put out back in the day that's really kind of the the medium to hear it on just as I think there are some records that you know they were mixed and they were mastered to sound the best on cassette so if you could run across them on a on a fresh you know not warped cassette they probably sound great on it but sort of you know rethink Third Eye Blind is just you know being put on a vinyl record is kind of crazy to me it's sort of interesting how today you know in this very modern this very digital era seems like we're more obsessed with the older world than we ever have been and and in that respect you know while you may feel out of place in some respects with your suits and and all of that I mean in other ways you're really not that out of place that's very true I mean you know I remember even back in 2012 when when vinyl records were really starting to become quite popular again you know people were going on about how they were getting this how they're getting that and even when I was looking up a few days ago actually some some popular songs and there they were you know on vinyl and you know that's when you think about that it's not the kind of music that you would imagine being on a record you know absolutely so it is very interesting to see you know a lot of people still when they think of vinyl they might think of you know some even you know the Beatles classic you know classic rock even classic pop music and even going way back to swing music you know think of that and on a record and not you know hearing Third Eye Blind or you know even in the present day hearing you know pitbull on non vinyl you know oh god that's probably some where are we a pitbull vinyl somewhere gotta be well I mean aside from music I know that another thing that you've just kind of broadcast recently on your YouTube channel uh I guess you're somewhat passionate about traveling or at least you had done some traveling recently uh you know and it tried some different fast food places or some different restaurants maybe on future trips or in future reviews you know have you kind of any interest in to maybe sort of covering some smaller eating spots or anything like that you know people have always suggested to me they'll say you know you always review bigger brands I would like to see you review maybe some local places and some smaller places and I think you know in my in my you know food repertoire I do know many local establishments with which do have great food and it would be great to review but the reason why I'm always hesitant on reviewing more local smaller places is just because I try to find how applicable they might be to a wider audience to a nationwide audience and if there is you know a more local place just one restaurant but saying you know it's been talked about on on television you know saying you know Guy Fieri went there on Food Network or was mentioned on the Travel Channel and people kind of know about it you know it kind of has almost an iconic type of fall and that I might review one day if I'm ever out traveling and I see this diner and let's say you know I might review that but say it says like some mom and pop you know pizza place I wouldn't necessarily give that a review just based on how clickable it might be you know I can go and talk for for 10 minutes about how good their pizza might be but in the end while people might still watch it how many people would really be influenced about it you know maybe three or four who might be in the general area and can probably go there regularly but chances are there's not going to be a mass you know mask pilgrimage to this pizza place just because I said they have a good pepperoni slice you know no man it might it might be it might be an experiment worth trying well know that one day my just worth it worth a shot you know just to see if I firing this pizza place you know what would happen just sort of just sort of toss one in there every once in a while and just kind of see what the reaction is and and also you know you could end up in there the next week and maybe then maybe the people who run the restaurant of senior review and and they either love it and they give you free pizza or they hate you and they kick you out and you're not allowed in they bring up a good point you never know until you try really it could make life for you locally really really interesting and exciting to start reviewing the fast food places in the the restaurant sort of places a that are immediately near you of which you know I know being in New England myself I mean there's a ton of small mom-and-pop places everywhere in a direction of you know selling all kinds of of food I mean it seems like there's new restaurants kind of cropping up everywhere every day oh yeah around around here yeah I can say the same yeah maybe maybe one day I just found that in for the Knicks and see what happens please do I'll watch it and to sort of end things off I wanted to ask you to finish sort of right now you know what are your plans for the future in terms of you know well you know your your personal life your your work and and even your YouTube channel I mean as as far as your 5-year plan goes I guess you know are you focusing on continuing to be a youtuber I mean I noticed recently you've also started monetizing on your videos I believe which I don't I don't think you had done for a great deal of the channels existence is that correct that is correct um you know are you trying to go a you know full-time with the YouTube channel and sort of take it to the next level or you know do your do your work ambitions kind of sit outside of YouTube definitely right now what I see is definitely going to be focusing on the channel a lot more you know one of the reasons why did I guess monetize is to keep that sustainable to be able to get enough to keep the channel moving keep things flowing you know acquiring number one for transportation number two for just keeping same feeling maybe upgrades here there I think I would have increased the frequency of the reviews too but definitely going to continue to vote in more time to the YouTube the channels not going to be disappearing or shutting down any time soon you know I have no plans on on stopping the reviews now my plan is to definitely continue on with the reviews probably keep keep a focus on what I have now you know mostly popular items some frozen food prices some energy drinks maybe even a local place here and there one thing I would like to see with the channel you know just recently I brought back the the auto mind lecture series by by popular demand so kind of also focus on other series to maybe in an idle mind lecture here and there keep working on the vo RW shows and in terms of any new new series I've had this idea kind of bouncing around in my mind for about a year now is maybe the one day branch out from just energy drinks and I were doing regular drinks you know different types of sodas say if Coke or Pepsi comes out with a new flavor or some promotional item you know if there's a new type of good old Mountain Dew be able to try that out too and review that and just do general drink reviews as well a various beverages yeah I think um you know I think I think branching out would probably probably be best you know not only for the variety of the channel but but also um you know you can't just be eating fast food and frozen pizza all the time you know you're not going to feel sooo good if you continue on that oh yeah it's baked the truth alright again I want to thank you for coming on the show being a guest answering the questions being a good sport and I assure you taking the time well thank you for having me it's really been a pleasure and I enjoy being here a lot "
HJr7UTqO2Q0,hi everyone I'm sorry you hate me on tumblr the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Rory album all we need Rory is in Atlanta singer and rapper songwriter and this is his full-length commercial debut and the thing that's interesting about Rory on this record and when he broke with his little debut mixtape indigo child is that he fuses these worlds of music like indie folk and hip hop think a little bit of andre 3000 mixed with a little bit of Fleet Foxes now prior to the release of this album and his breakthrough tape he did have some mild internet hits tracks like gods whisper as well as cigarette song tracks that weren't that fantastic but they weren't really that bad either in my opinion however the mixtape that these songs landed on was incredibly rough from the songs to the singing to the recording to the rapping nearly everything on this record sounded like it could have used an incredible amount of improvement but it was still interesting that Rory was fusing the musical worlds that he was and I'm willing to write this mixtape off because at the time that this tape drop Rory was really young he's still young now and the height that he had for this mixtape really came out of nowhere and since then he seems to have grown as an artist a little bit been collaborating with some other pretty interesting artists done some cool features so I did go into this new album with high hopes but I think Rory has only given us a record that is only slightly better than his previous mixtape I think the largest improvement that Rory has brought to the table on this record is a lyrical one he seems to be choosing his words and his messages a lot more carefully than he was on his last tape especially on tracks like forbidden knowledge where he seems to be dropping one conscious line after another throughout the entire track he invites Big KRIT on to the song to do the same and I enjoy what Rory is saying on this track I think his earnestness and his frankness on these issues is really great it's really in important however his monotone voice is just not really doing that much for me it's not exactly compelling in the same monotone sound kind of pulls down a lot of the other tracks in the tracklisting here Rory is far from convincing when he is just pleading with some girl to respond to his texts on the song love is not a four-letter word we're after getting frustrated with her lack of response he essentially brings himself to a conclusion where he's the one rejecting her and he doesn't need her anyway ah however for the most part I do give Rory poetry points on this record although every once in a while we do get a line like you can be salty like those fries if you supersize them I know what this is Cal you ghost wrote that line didn't you I know your ghost writing I know when I hear it I know when your ghost writing you keep at that that's good it's good that you're getting work then there's the production on this record and the singing which I think has only slightly improved there is bigger and more extravagant instrumentation on a lot of the mixes of these songs but it comes together in a slightly sloppy way occasionally there are exceptions like on the thunderous walls of synths on the song her but for the most part the instrumentation sounds a little flat a little cluttered namely on the song Devil's whisper or on the song love is not a four-letter word where we get this out of place jaw harp pointing away against some really bright brass and there are a few spots here like the closing track namely where the instrumentation just sounds way too sugary for its own good and like with Rory's last mixtape there are a lot of vocal harmonies on this thing but rather than improve them in any kind of way it feels like Rory has just started to tuck them back in the distance in the mix so that the flubs and the fact that the vocal harmonies don't come together that well isn't really a focal point but the thing is these vocal harmonies they really should be upfront in order to color these tracks properly and really provide some kind of impact and punch instead they just kind of hide away in the back and don't really provide that much flavor however I wouldn't say that this record is all bad once again Rory is one of the few artists fusing these worlds of funk and hip-hop together in a way that feels authentic natural and doesn't make me cringe like on the track trap tears which is a song that goes over way better than I think it should have given it's really somber acoustic intro we get a bunch of lyrics that kind of talk about addiction and I guess the downside of the trap and then once the hook pops and we get this booming sub bass kind of a trap style instrumental comes rolling in Rory's vocals are just so deadpan but stone-faced in such a way where he sounds like he's a emotionless and cold sort of like after years of being tortured over these issues and now he's just kind of numb to the pain and I think the song mama is actually really heartfelt and a surprising change of pace from the silly completely unnecessary argument that he placed on his last mixtape with who seemed like his mother and now he's kind of giving her this tribute in such a way where it's it's actually a really moving compelling song it may be a little cliched here and there with some of his vocalizations but I do think he puts a little bit more expression in his vocals than he did on some of the other tracks here and there are some other songs on here where I think the tunes really stand out even if I think the vocal delivery isn't really that fantastic songs like revolution where we actually had a pretty cool refrain on this track and there are some slight hints of Kanye influence going into the production on this thing and surprisingly enough I kind of liked the song CPU as well not only is Rizzo's verse on this track pretty cool but Rory's vocal melody is great as well and I don't know why but once he's kind of manipulated his voice and thrown I don't know some auto-tune or something over it on this cut he's singing in a more expressive manner on this track too I also want to say this is one of several tracks on this record where Rory really seems to channel his energy ah yay but like with worries last mixtape I think we have a little bit of unnecessary filler on this thing - I think DJ slow jazz is quite possibly one of the worst album filler concepts I've heard in a long time it really adds nothing to the character or what little narrative this album has it's just kind of a constant obnoxious cliched distraction of a smooth-talking radio DJ that doesn't even really fit the character of the music on this thing yeah pretty torn on this record I mean it's certainly an improvement past his last album and I guess at this point I'm starting to see the potential in Rory that a lot of other people are I mean I guess I kind of see the hype this time a bit more however I don't think this album executes it's with fantastic performances and songs on the interesting fusion of musical worlds that Rory presents I appreciate that Rory is very versatile and it seems like he has a lot of irons in the fire between his guitar playing and his songwriting and his singing and his rapping all of which he pulls together pretty well but he does neither of them amazingly I'm feeling a decent strong 5 on this LP transition have you finger me have you given this record illicit if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Rory forever 
AA3c4mTl8A4,and that a can review it again attend an attend review it again attend attend review it again hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a track review of the new Adele song hello Adele UK soul singing sensation Adele is back with a new track after a pretty long hiatus which I and many other music fans did not know when it would end and it just seems to have ended with this new single and the announcement there is a new record on the way so this single in a way sort of setting the tone for this new record what fans are and expect from this new record and prior to this I thought Adele had a fantastic voice and a pretty interesting and very modern approach to soul music I'm not gonna go into too much background description and all that stuff this new track is out the Internet's on fire what do I think of it but I think it's a decent track the song has a very good setup Adele comes in with these somber vocals incredibly personal lyrics and we hear a story where it sounds like she's on the phone with somebody who she misses probably in a romantic sense she's apologizing the lyrics take a sentimental turn later on the track and she starts talking about the past and it seems that these memories are kind of getting to her and are driving away whatever sorts of demons made them split up in the first place and she's just kind of starting this phone call here to reinitiate and then rebuild I guess the bridge that was once there and underneath these vocals are just some very simple somber piano chords not a whole lot it's an incredibly stark and simple and minimal beginning and then of course once the chorus launches off Adele's vocals just skyrocket in terms of volume and emotion and reaching up into her range as well but I think the hook on this thing does drop the ball a little bit and I think it does it instrumental what is underneath Adele's vocals at this point in the song just feels really Airy and just lacks any sort of punch the instrumentation does build up toward the very back end of the record and it feels huge orchestral in a sense very grand and showy but I guess I just missed that that moment in Adele's career where instead of sounding like just an overwrought overly emotional bit of a soundtrack pop that would be worked into I don't know something like one of the next Hunger Games movies that we hear something instead that feels a little more tangible the instrumentation on this track it shimmers but it just feels so digital it feels so flat it feels so hollow I was hoping for more layers of just really palpable instrumentation Adele herself I think vocally is doing fantastic on the hook if it weren't for her fantastic vocals on this chorus I think at this point in the song the tracker really just would have lost me entirely outside of that I think this track has a lot going for it and I'm just hoping that the next single or whatever songs are deeper into this track listing just have instrumentation that's a bit more punchy a bit more lively and really gives Adele the platform that her voice deserves I think the instrumentation really lacked the power that her vocals brought to the table way to mechanical and expensive and and glitzy whereas Adele just feels really human and personal I just wish the instrumentation felt as organic as her emotions do on this track and those are just pretty much my thoughts on the song it's an OK track the vocals are stellar the tune is fine the instrumentation I think really again drop the ball on that hook but what do you think of this song do you love it you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it transition have you given this song a listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Adele forever 
_ygkBblLHTE,that was bad whoa whoa whoa hey everyone wreaths and a view tan oh here the Internet's review review review music and it's time for a review of the new Big KRIT mixtape it's better this way oh you hear that ladies and gentlemen the big creek the scariest monster this side of the Mississippi um he's a he's a rapper he's not not a monster no way I know he's a scary man he sounds scary man Big KRIT is a Mississippi rapper who came up about 5 years ago at this point with a pretty awesome mixtape crit was here and since the release of this tape he has released several other album quality mixtapes for free and while these projects are good sometimes ranging up to amazing I think that he's had a hard time translating this talent that he has onto his commercial projects this is something that he has acknowledged in his own lyrics now out of the blue he's released this new mixtape he's just dropping one after another I will say before we get into this tape he is a pretty versatile rapper a rapper who tends to produce a lot of his instrumentals he has tons of tracks that are more personal introspective more conscious in nature address a lot of social issues other songs that are fantastic party songs songs about cars women money success the rap game it's rare that an artist comes along and bridges the gap between these two worlds as well as crit does which is why I've continued to listen to him and check up on him and his new music because I think he's a talented and an interesting artist now he's dropped a new tape out of the blue and he's making a huge statement right out of the gate with the album art here with the title of this tape and also the introductory track of this tape how this album essentially starts is crits car stalls so he's left on foot and he is standing at a crossroads and he to decide which direction is he going to go in is he going to go in the direction that he went before and other people went that way or a direction that he went another time and it was bad or is he gonna go in this new bold amazing totally different direction and I embrace this sentiment I think Crate has dropped so much music at this point that while he has displayed quite a bit of versatility he's also exposed a bit of a formula he goes into almost every project with so I'm kind of looking for a change from crib it of a an alteration of some kind that will bring him into the next few years feeling kind of fresh exciting and different however going into this new project over here he still sounds very greatly influenced by the same number of artists people like Kanye West Andre 3000 David Banner Scarface 8ball & MJG a little bit of trap a little bit of soul a little bit of jazz and of course across all of these songs it delivers a little bit of a narrative and I love the imagery of the introductory track and I'm absolutely floored by the following song Qing part for the Jazz instrumental on this song is intense as hell it's fantastic it's intricate it's layered it's beautiful Kretz delivery over this track while he may be addressing a lot of the same themes he usually does about success and determination and so on and so forth it's definitely one of the most fiery deliveries he's laid on to a song in a while shortly after this track falls into a pattern of familiarity with the song 86 something that he even acknowledges with the skit that happens before this song he approaches that familiar character that has appeared on his mixtapes before talking about 1986 and he's like oh this guy's gonna say something about in 1986 again so they go into this 1986 spiel mentioning all of these very culturally relevant moments from the year 1986 then they bust into a song which as I said is titled 86 and the previous song that he did that was pretty much titled after 1986 was so much better not only is this track inferior but crit is so obviously just repeating a theme and a song concept that he had before which so boldly goes against what the title the cover and the intro of this mixtape tells us this is not some road that crit has never taken before this is very much a track that could have slipped on to his last album or his previous mixtape and it would have fit there and not sounded out of place and the thing is I think the album kind of goes downhill from here I mean once crit embraces his old ways once again I think he just kind of falls into familiar patterns and starts delivering these kind of mediocre southern flavored pop rap tracks like on the song no static or on the song shaken off where I don't see the appeal of his guest producers production at all I feel like Big KRIT could have produced this beat with one hand tied behind his back this beat is so skeletal it's so flat and the synth bassline is not doing anything for me it's just so rigid and and lifeless it's a little old-school and vibe but I think that's really the only shred of Appeal as going for it and I'm equally uninterested in the auto-tune ballad that this same guy produces later on the record the song Vanilla Sky is kind of one of those sweet somber interludes that we often get on a Big KRIT song where crit is singing it's surprisingly enough one of his better sung tracks but again I feel like this is another moment on this record where crit is falling into the same patterns he's done time and time and time again on his previous projects I feel as if he's just done a bit of a baton switch on this new mixtape over here not only that he's kind of drowning himself out by refusing to reinvent himself in any significant way as we go deeper into the record the album fails to do anything exciting on the song keep it booming or party tonight which given the title you would expect I don't know something worth having a party - but instead the instrumental and big crate self delivery wise sounds like he's in need of a nap where's the allure and the electricity and the excitement and just the the vibe that you just want to be driving really slow with this booming out of your car midday in a crowded area even the moments on this record where I feel like crit is trying to make some kind of poignant observation with his lyrics don't really hit me that hard because he continually makes the same observations over and over and over in the same ways that he has before again I I feel like we've gotten the exact opposite of what this tape tells us that we're getting we're not getting anything different we're not getting anything revolutionary we're not even getting anything the least bit reinvented it's it's the the same elements that we've been getting from crit for the past seven projects just kind of rearranged in a slight way to the point where it's kind of aggravating and not only that but songwriting wise I feel like this this little mixtape over here is kind out to lunch I think there are some tracks on here that I could separate out of the track listing here a handful or so and I could enjoy them and there are a few instrumentals here and there outside of those tracks that I think are decent but other than that this mixtape is is slim pickins for me honestly I'm feeling a light two decent five on this tape transition have you given this record of listen if you have did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music forever 
nPtocY4kuLw,hi everyone we need bono here the Internet's in and it's time for a review of the new deer hunter record fading frontier there you go ladies and gentlemen the deer hunter back from the dead to head the deer whose memories are their parents dying from The Deer Hunter and you kick in the risk because the deer are still alive the ghost world hunting the deer hey hey hey deer hunter is an Atlanta indie rock outfit and they have some kind of noisy psychedelic tendencies and believe it or not it's actually been 10 years since the release of their debut album album album well it's actually been quite a ride this is the release of that album the band's breakthrough LP cryptograms their follow-up and very ambitious double album micro Castle and weird era continued their pop opus Halcyon Digest and their last full-length album kind of saw the band going down more low fight territory monomania now we have a new record over here not a lengthy album at 37 minutes in length just nine cuts however I did go into this project with positive vibes because I enjoyed the tracks that came out before the release it seemed almost as if we were getting a bolder more upfront more intimate Deerhunter with just less psychedelic effects in the mix especially on the song snakeskin where we get a rough and tough in-your-face groove and even the instrumental and the vocals on the very soft and kind of fragile Breaker felt very upfront as well and a great deal of this album over here follows suit with I guess the sonic clarity of those teaser tracks in a way this is kind of raw unadulterated Deerhunter but I wouldn't say the end result is exciting or Xplosive snakeskin I would say is probably the high-water mark of energy on this album it's a great track most likely will be one of my favorite singles of the year however the energy level drops off on a lot of these other songs as Bradford Cox and company kind of toy with a lot of rock and pop styles across this record with the song all the same Deerhunter eases us into the album with a track that sounds like it could have fit onto any number of previous Deerhunter albums and wouldn't have sounded out of place it's very easygoing it's very intoxicating but kind of odd as well I like Bradford Cox's very expressive vocal delivery on this track lyrics like you should take your handicaps channel them and feed them back our proof that Bradford does have some really nice one-liners on this thing also the kind of vocal melody on here as well as the twangy guitar leads that color much of this track feel like something straight out of the psyche pop era although the track does kind of have an abrupt ending a bit of a non ending I wish the song was longer which should extend it a bit longer especially since this album is tragically short in a sense and it's actually one of a couple tracks on here that actually feature a a bit of a dead end ending songs like duplex planet or the closing track on this LP which I thought had one of the better Tunes here but a kind of rickety structure that kills the impact of the song however I think there are some very nice fleshed out songs and the track listing here track like snakeskin as I mentioned earlier loved that track also living my life I live in my it's a really odd turn for this album because it's one of the tracks on here that is very synthetic in tone and really heavenly too there are these odd digital stretch marks on the opening very ethereal chords at the start of this track and there's some kind of intricate but very smooth and bustling beats and bass behind all these chords as well which are pretty nice and the mantra that comes up at the back end of this track which is incredibly catchy it just tells me that if Deerhunter wanted to go down a bit of a an indie tronic or synth-pop avenue with a future album it could potentially go over really well and on the song breaker which i mentioned i like a lot but this track it's got an odd flavor to it just odd for Deerhunter especially once the chorus pops up it sounds like a bit of jangle pop or brick rock that would have done kind of well on the radio in the UK back in the 90s and while I think the tune is really well written and it's it's just a sharp song it sounds nice the production is nice and clear I'm not really sure if this is the kind of sound that people go to Deerhunter for but one of my favourite tracks in the track listening here is one of the most blissful and that's the song take care and with how blissful it started off it felt almost inspired by beach houses song take care but it's actually a completely different tune it's like a serene psychedelic inviting lullaby the flourishes of guitars and since throughout this track throughout the first half of the track has me feeling like I'm floating on a pink cloud while the crescendo of instrumentation on the back end of the song is really exhilarating there's a lot of propulsion behind the instrumentation here however we do have other tracks on here that I don't really care for that much we have the kind of uneventful ad astra which is one track on here that I think kind of goes against the clarity vibe that a lot of these songs bring forward and sort of gets lost in its own dream to the point where it becomes slightly unmemorable and then there's the song leather and wood which takes a really odd turn into painfully awkward territory over a very sparse instrumental with some very dissonant broken pianos with Bradford giving us one of his strangest vocal performances on a Deer Hunter record to date it feels more like something that would turn up on one of his solo projects more than a deer hunter record now despite the fact that I think there are some real highlights here and in some of the best Deer Hunter material to date those couple of tracks that I don't really care for as well as a few others that I or maybe a little bland a little run-of-the-mill or just have abrupt endings are enough to kind of kick this album off-balance a little bit plus I don't really think there's that strong of a vibe that pulls all of these songs together really it could have to do with some songs just having a completely different stylistic take than others could have to do with just the lack of quality consistency among these tracks I think in other words I think this record kind of feels like a b-sides album in a way however the production is really good it's a very nice sounding b-sides album it doesn't sound under produced in any way but the material here is is maybe a little underwhelming I guess I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this record of listen if you have did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music forever 
5yl6jZ0Ac0o,hi everyone Tiffany can't hang out here the Internet's busiest music yeah and it's time for a review of the new beach house record thank your lucky stars that Beach s is hanging it's full of ghosts of the fish that died it that B it's just a regular beach house that they need their duo after I guess it's not nothing to do always it's a headache beaches beach house is a Baltimore pop duo who I am reviewing for the second time this year because just weeks after the release of their last album depression cherry they came out with this record over here a new surprise album that fans didn't know was coming down the pipe they just pull it out from their sleeve like oh yeah we had another record here it is and with this album coming out so close to the release of their last LP I guess it's kind of hard to say what I was expecting going into this new record for me depression cherry was just a slight disappointment it just felt like a more naked more stripped back version of the same duo that I've been enjoying for a long time there were some good tunes on the album though can't take that away from it now on thank your lucky stars the veil is actually back the reverb is back the atmosphere is just more open and spacious but the instrumentals here are actually more skeletal muscles been sounding this skeletal since the days of their debut record and devotion it seems that rather than push forward excitingly as they have on previous records like devotion as well as Teen Dream where Beach House was killing it with tons of instrumental experiments they have now taken tons and tons and tons of steps back to recreate their older sound I think there are most likely a lot of fans that will go into this record pleased because it sounds like another Beach House record the vocals the keys the very simple drum beats the drum machine beats a lot of the time are back on this thing the same kind of twine sparkly guitar leads and melodies I don't need to tell you that these elements are here on this record because you've heard them on pretty much every previous beachhouse album on this record for the most part beach house really only just barely scrapes and claws up to a standard more than they do exceed expectations as there's really absolutely nothing about a lot of the tracks in this track listing that make these songs stand out in any significant way from what beach house has done previously songs like majorette where the song is just simply alright or even the song one thing which is maybe one of the most under written Beach House songs to date not only is the vocal melody just dreadfully boring but the groove is incredibly tedious on this thing the only thing that makes this track significant in any kind of way is that the guitar solo on here is loud it's kind of distorted the guitar playing has a little bit of swagger to it which is not often an attitude that you usually get on a beach house song however I wouldn't really say that that slightly bolder guitar playing is enough to save this or any song on this record it just feels like another batch of beach houses usual vocal melodies their usual guitar intervals dancing up and down the neck of the guitar just rearranged in a slightly different way and there are some cuts on this record that offer kind of non endings as a lot of songs on depression cherry did the track the traveller is an example where this kind of sour chord is just laid on and kind of just carries the song out suddenly there are a couple highlights in the track listing here I think the song she so lovely has a nice tune to it some of the most somber and just really heart cutting chords on the entire record and the song common girl is one of the few moments here where the lyrics actually stand out in a significant way which to me serves as a reminder as to how many moments in beach houses previous discography songs off of devotion songs off of teen dream where the lyrics were really bold and upfront very clear and very in your face and very telling despite the music being as dreamy as it was here it's like the exact opposite beach house is like putting themselves to sleep on the song all your Yeahs I like the dreamy production I like the kind of slow skeletal driving guitars but the kick drum on this track is mixed very oddly it's almost demo ish it's it's like the rawness of the production here goes too far in that raw direction to truly not only embody beach houses older sound but to really get that dreamy vibe across and I think the closing track on here is decent tune wise it sounds like a it's it's like a bit of a last dance at a prom or something mmm but that's really all I can say about this thing it just falls even shorter of my expectations than depression cherry did a beach house is trying to go back in time in order to I don't know get together some inspiration or something but they come back empty-handed this material sounds nowhere near as inspired as the material did when they were originally playing with this very same sound Legrand's vocals are no longer commanding or heart-wrenching or bellowing in such a way that they really just steal the spotlight and take center stage in the music she's merely just another forgettable piece of instrumentation and the mix here I think this record has for the most part the enjoyable aesthetic and vibe that you would look for her to be chance record but the the wonderful and memorable song writing lyrics and bits of I guess extra instrumentation that would be worked into some of their more well produced material doesn't show up it's just not there this this release just feels so hollow it's feel so extra and an extra in the sense that I mean it's not really adding to the lure of beach house in any kind of way it's like leftovers I'm feeling the light two DS and five on this thing transition have you music music good forever 
bSF5oUGtqqs,hi everyone from window veneer the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new neon indian record Vega International night-school Anthony I believe the term is MIA Native American please don't trigger me Neon Indian is the musical project of producer multi-instrumentalist singer and songwriter Allen palomo who broke in the late 2000s on the music blogosphere which was bustling at the time with buzz for a new genre of music called chill wave we were just chilling that wave and we were loving this neon indian project songs like deadbeat summer singles that would end up on neon Indians debut full-length album psychic chasms and this chill wave movement that was going on at the time really the chill wave bubble that was going on at the time was this style of music that everybody was hyping up to be the next big cool thing that everybody liked but the more we hyped it up it seemed the faster we got sick of it and then once we got sick of it all these artists we had pigeon holed into this style of music just kind of had the relevance ripped out from under them leaving a lot of them in a position where they had to change their sound in some kind of way some of these artists adjusted well came through with successful albums but I don't really think Neon Indian did the follow-up record to psychic chasms in my opinion incredibly lackluster however this new album over here it's been a while since the release of that last night in the NLP not really sure to expect from this new album I did notice that Vega is the name of a project that Allen has also released music under so maybe we'll be seeing a collision of the Neon Indian and the Vega musical world and also this album cover is easily one of the boldest visual statements of 2015 having said all that Allen pulls together a pretty sharp album this time around it's a little nostalgic it's a little vintage a little obsessed with 80s pop and $0.80 funk it's a little kitschy but it doesn't take away from the fact that it's produced pretty well it's colorful it's fun and there's some very catchy songs on here to allens love of analog synthesizers shows up in the mix on this record in a big way these tracks are filled with them not only that but some killer grooves too it reminds me of chillwave in that it's it's very nostalgic but it doesn't have the the the gimmicky cheap miss that a lot of chili red x' originally did it doesn't feel one-dimensional I guess it's also got a bit of a sense of humor if you're paying very close attention to the vocal which are buried a lot of the time there is one moment where the title of the record is mentioned in the lyrics and then you kind of get this vocal snippet saying hoots Noom the record there are also tracks on the back end of this thing like c'est la vie which are incredibly goofy silly a little over-the-top to the point where it gets slightly obnoxious I think but I guess you can go into this album knowing safely that Alan is taking himself too seriously or anything like that it's an album that wants to have fun it encourages you to have fun to laugh a little bit but but it's a little aerial pink it's a little Toro y Moi especially that underneath the pine era and some tracks bring some more modern sounds like techno cleek where we do get some tech house a little bit on here the tune isn't really that fantastic but the beat is certainly strong and on the song bozo we have this funky little warped dance loop with a hard ass groove that sounds like homework era Daft Punk not too bad and the vocals for the most part kind of singing this falsetto soprano range feel little Prince and Michael Jackson inspired quite a bit of variety actually happens behind the wall of kind of psychedelic synths that cover many of the tracks here and even though the layers upon layers upon layers of sense on this thing feel sort of impenetrable compressed very fat very bouncy some highlights do manage to shine through in this beautiful little night school that's taking place in a very dimly lit rosey club where everybody's wearing form-fitting clothing and headbands and sweating and dancing the night away and we're a configure les gloves the - nanny it's okay but I do like the steady guitars and drums on this track especially the upstroke on the guitars it's one of the two moments on here that feels a little reggae inspired I can't say I love the song street level either but I do like the production on here as well especially the very warped woozy blurting synth leads on this thing it's a really trippy track it's dizzyingly weird how the sounds are so heavily warped on this thing I love the song glitzy hive this is one of the best hooks on the entire record possibly the best hook on the entire record bad the beat change on this track is fantastic is well in dear Scorpio magazine another part of the amazing stride that I think this album hits right at the midpoint of the record a song of seduction it's one of the few moments on the record where the lyrics actually pop quite a bit too often they feel a little too buried a little too obscure but you actually kind of get a tail of attraction in this song that's that's actually pretty readable the hook is fantastic as well also another song where the lyrics shine through is slumlord a track on here where Alan gives us a very pointed topic and subject matter in the lyrics the extension of this track as well where Alan takes the beat of the song and turns it into an extended dance groove is really great an undeniable dance groove not that the original track didn't have an undeniable dance groove and that's and that's the thing so many good dancey grooves on this thing I was rocking my hips the ending of this record is a little all over the place for me though we do have those sort of oddball tracks that turn me off a bit the song baby's eyes is kind of Alan's shot at a bit of a low-key ballad as is the closing track neither of which am i head over heels for I find myself kind of torn there some tracks here where I feel like I just wish there was a stronger vocal presence while in other songs where Alan does sort of seem to make room for his voice I'm not really in love with his somewhat nasal singing I guess I appreciate that it does sound old-school in tone and the way that he produces his vocals and mixes them does add the kind of warped psychedelic weird alternate musical eighties pop reality world that this album is coming from I just wish the whole LP wasn't so sloshy throughout the whole goddamn thing it's so melted that the songs just kind of all warped into one another in a way that helps the flow of this record because it makes it feel like this really cool sink tub musical experience but the other edge of that sword is that I think some of the tracks here just outright forgettable I think almost the entirety of this record sounds fantastic in the background I mean it's fantastic it just kind of painting the air and just filling the room with these wonderful dance grooves however upon closer inspection I think some of these songs or may be a little underwhelming but still overall the record does sound like one long beautiful drunken memory it's definitely a good record I'm definitely recommending it I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing give it a listen it's fun it's a fun record yeah I'll leave it at that transition have you music music good forever 
OESBE0xA5eY,ah hi everyone handy about a new burner and it's time for a final update where I talk about records that have recently made their way into my vinyl collection over here I had been up until recently doing a lot of videos about the 7 inches in my collection the singles in my collection and now that that's all over and done with we are going to get back to LPS full-lengths big boy records for the big boys before I get too deep into this I do want to give two to shout outs over here I want to get a shout out to vinyl me please because they hooked me up with a very nice vinyl copy of for tetes one of for Ted's latest releases a pink which I gave this a review on the channel I believe this went in a bit of a colder more hard-nosed and just a more robotic just more frigid techno direction than a lot of his other solo material and though it wasn't bad and it's very heavy heavy thick nice double LP just sort of a black pressing finally please if you didn't know they're a pretty cool vinyl of the Month Club which hook you up with exclusive pressings of various records in different genres and styles there is a link to their service down in the description box they support the show they're nice people so yeah they hooked me up with this double LP of four tetes pink that's very nice and also another record I got hooked up with fan of the show Kyle sent me a vinyl copy of a record that I reviewed positively on the channel a while ago on exploding sound records this is piles dripping if you're looking for some shouty and very eclectic indie rock with some good guitar work because there's some good guitar work on this thing look up piles dripping got a review for on the channel and it's a cool little record and nothing too extravagant about the know the packaging over here your simple black vinyl in a cardboard sleeve but I actually I'm very familiar with the album itself but I have not put this on to the turntable yet so I will be looking forward to laying this on the turntable alright moving on we have a bit of an exclusive pressing over here of one of my favorites one of my modern favorites we have a copy of andrew jackson Jihad's people who can eat people are the luckiest people in the world there's a bit of folk Punk over here very snarky very smart very um it's funny the lyrics lyrics are funny but it's it's it's dark humour it's black humor in the lyrics a lot of the time occasionally self-deprecating as well and this is a one of the records in their discography that had a very strong folky vibe to it whereas their their following records were much more electric and we have tracks on here such as rejoice brave as a noun survival song bad bad things no more tears bells and whistles Randy's house and so on and so forth and I guess what kind of makes this record special according to the label here which was written out is that this is a brown album it's brown which apparently there's only several hundreds of these brown copies of this record which is pretty crazy so I got me a brown copy of this record and is mine so there you go see it's brown ish it's kind of a weird purpley vibe to it too to the color but uh yeah I guess it's brown enough to kind of get that brown label on the front written Brown 400 there you go alright moving on moving on up okay man Oh thank you I want to give a shout out to the people at Italians do it better records they sent me a few of their new releases and I'm going to check them out but I just wanted to put this in here because I'm very familiar with this song this is this is probably one of the first records I heard on Italians do it better it is a 12-inch single of one of my favorite albums or one of my favorite songs on the label it's from an artist by the name of Farah the song is called gay boy gay boy gay boy make you change your mind hang your mind it's kind of about um one uh weird white girls attempt at sexually seducing a gay boy what she describes as a gay boy it's odd it's it's odd we have the chocolate martinis instrumental and her and the drums on one side and then we just have gay boy lullaby and radio version on on this side of the record it's it's an odd song look up fara FA are aah gay boy if you want to hear an odd little tune and it's it's it's a strange little novelty track that that has a special place in my heart because I think it's I think it's hilarious I think it's strange and it needs to be on vinyl and forever just living in my collection so that's that's all there is to say about that I picked up a copy because I'm just such a big fan of the of the album I just had to get another single from it wires last record mess they came out with a 12-inch single for one of my favorite tracks off the record Pro anti anti and not only is the submission cover art but we also have a bit of a b-side on here with song waste fraud and we have a bunch of remixes we have the Daniel Miller radio mix of this song the factory floor remix I'm excited actually hear that remix the Tres remix in the nest of teens remix so we actually have several remixes of this single on this 12-inch and also it's kind of this nice little orange e pinkish color it's a bit of a peach bit of a coral color to it pretty nice so yeah I'm really happy about that really happy about finding this picking this up since I do like that that liars record that mess records so much some y'all might know sitting in here somewhere I have that liars 12-inch where it's like the yarn is in the record it's in the record man it's in the record itself dude it's crazy it's crazy oh here it is here it is even mess on a mission man mission alright man we're getting deeper into this vinyl update got to give a shout out to my friend Derek my good buddy Derek he just got married congratulations to Derek you guys have seen him in a video was over his house the other day essentially made a trade with him you know I had an extra copy of a record over here in the collection that I knew he liked and I I gave him a cassette tape as well of a vaporwave tape he loves vaporwave so I made a bit of a trade he hooked me up with this record this freaking cure record pornography he hooked me up with this and then he gave me this singles collection from the Cure and then he gave me this EP from the Cure freaking the quadboss EP a night like this new day close to me a man inside my mouth all on this one nice little EP he hooked me up with these three records man good friend good buddies when you got buddies who hook you up like this you got to keep those buddies around so we got some cure over here and I was thinking just the other day you know I got kissed me and and I loved that cure record but I needed more cure in my collection and I've just taken a few steps to our remedying that so we've got some cure some more cure in the record collection over here all right keeping it post punky for this next record I bought a copy of the new ought album because I mean I just been spinning it man I just been spinning it I've been enjoying it also it's out on constellation records and they usually put together a good package and it's a nice thick heavy pressing also came with a poster that's really cool yeah and a bit of a print over here I like this I like this it's like I'm it's like a thought bubble huh there you go a bit of a screenshot for you also got a bit of a pained window over here seems like looking out into the city and as I said it's a nice thick pressing constellation kicking ass with this thick ass record and so yeah you know if you're into some art rock some post-punk oh and and all that stuff little Talking Heads a little a wire little television inspired but just you know very oddball definitely give this thing a listen it's got some great tunes on it and very excited to get this on the turntable soon although as I said I'm intimately familiar with the record gave a review definitely one of my favourite rock albums of this year again the band is aught title is Sun coming down there's the back end of it it's a good package it's a nice package for single sleeve it's not quite the gatefold but it's nice alright moving on I picked up a copy of this EP that I got familiar with after the release of their debut album black up Sub Pop Records this is a ship as Palaces EP that I got over here one of the couple EEPs that they released before the release of that album Shabazz Palaces of light it was on the templar label group is where it dropped and i did not know this going into buying this EP but it's actually a nice bright crisp clear green vinyl band very nice very nice it looks a little bluish in the camera though it looks green to me in person whatever this next one is a soundtrack of sorts seems to be the soundtrack to what is the j retard documentary better than something III think this record was sent to me by the people who put together this for this record we're releasing this record not directly by the people who did the documentary i don't think and it's actually a really huge package i mean this thing is huge it's uh it's yeah it's about the size of a record oh it feels like a little bit longer than a record because this thing is actually a book sure you do get a record at the very end of it and on this record they do have listed such a shame summer bitch no one stands me i get nervous tyrants head you call love let it all go that's that's just the first half right there and better than something's fading all the way death is forming not a substitute waiting for something nightmares let it all go so you do get a record on this thing which seems like it comes in a black sleeve i haven't there we go i haven't listened to see if the pressing is is great yet but it feels nice and it looks looks like to be in a great condition there we go but I was perusing through the book and looking at what what exactly is going on book wise in this package it's a little it's a little it's a little cumbersome but we're getting through it it's kind of involved it's its elaborate its elaborate but book wise we're just getting a lot of images of Jay it's pretty crazy fit whoa whoa that is not that is not PG that is whoa you can't okay we're just just go a little x-rated over here that's a dick all right there's a foreword if I wouldn't have found music I'm sure I would have been a petty criminal Wow and okay so there's like people talking about him in here and yeah I mean it's it's pretty extensive pretty awesome I mean it's it's an amazing tribute to one of the best garage punk musicians of the 2000s you know I mean it's really all you can say about Jay you know if you were going to sum it up in any kind of way you know great producer great songwriter tons of energy known for his electrifying live performances as well definitely look into this thing if you're a retard fan because this this looks you know this is going to go great with the the vinyl that I have is so far and again Jay retard better than something which you know also do look into the documentary that I'm assuming that this is the the soundtrack of of course 50-page color book with exclusive photographs interviews and Jay retard personal stories DVD with the film and 25 minutes of additional interviews with Jay retard and friends live Jay retard album there we go that's the package man it's crazy that's crazy yeah man Wow all right all right moving on because this is this is heavy there's some heavy however this thing over here is like the heaviest I've saved the best for last over here I say that I've truly saved the best for last on here this is a vinyl copy triple LP copy of Komachi Washington's the epic when I favorite records of this year you all see me review this thing is a three-hour jazz album of different styles sounds everything and as you can see it is thick like a mother because this thing as I said it's three LPS it's three hours long they managed to fit this entire record on the three LPS now I guess the downside to that is that they had to change up the track lifting a little bit in order to get all the songs on the records however knowing what I know of the songs actually don't mind this rearrangement especially on track one where a change of the guard is not backed up I asked him it's backed up by Isabel and asked him is on the back end of the LP whereas asked him to me was a track or a scheme was a track that felt too close to the intro track with the strings it was so heavy was so intense and I was hoping uh you know where I was I was thinking that that track would be so much better if there was a bit more space or you know we were given uh some just easier tracks you know to kind of uh separate those two moments and that's kind of what we're getting here and we get a bulk of the songs on to volume 2 a lot of the shorter tracks you know pretty much all the tracks that are under 10 minutes in length and you know we're getting a more sort of long cuts on Volume three including the Magnificent Seven rerun home Malcolm's theme clair de lune the message so yeah there is a bit of a track listing rearrangement on this thing in order to get it to all kind of fit however we do get these three beautifully packaged records gold black red and you know very very you know nice simple kind of minimal faces on the Front's of the sleeves but on the back we have extensive credits we have you know personnel listed we have all the tracks listed along with some sort of wonderful pictures Kumasi Washington looking like this the moon is coming out of his saxophone the whole band here the the core of the band pictured there and also a Komachi standing very stoic Lee with his sax and we also have like a few inserts kicking around in here change of the guard really epic looking like a samurai some sort or just you know like a warrior we also have like an extensive story that comes along with with this over here it's actually pretty awesome very intricate design over here on another piece of art that comes with the epic and on the back side I guess we you know have more sort of credits and personnel listed it's actually really fantastic extensive package however I have not sort of dug my teeth into it fully because it is a three hour album and you know I sort of really cherish what few times I have had since the release of this album to sit down and listen to the whole thing you know or at least sit down and listen to a vast majority of it and you know it's kind of rare that that occasion comes around but you know my birthday is coming up at the end of the month and I will probably do my best to make some time to you know have this album up in my life vinyl wise I guess is a I guess is what I'm saying so yes I will stop freaking you out by handling the record like this by sliding them into the very thick very sturdy I mean this thing is like a rock very thick cardboard casing I will stop freaking you out and I will just kind of put it simply that this package is amazing this is definitely one of the most impressive vinyl sets of any one album or project that I think I own this is incredibly impressive I mean if this you know is one of your favorite albums of the year as it is mine this vinyl package does this album so much justice this is wonderful I really can't say enough nice things about what they did with this vinyl package its it looks fantastic it feels great it just kind of adds to the aura of this record you know it's it's definitely one of the most fantastic and I want to say I'm beautifully recorded and written and amazingly perform jazz records in a long time and and this is just really the way to compliment it this is really a package that this album deserved so all the power to people to the people over brain feeder records for you know for what you know seems like really investing in Komachi and this album because again

3e_yNhZMXMU,where do you like why do your life why do your life why do you like why do you like why do you like why do you eh hi everyone tell ffunny truth tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new this world is a beautiful place and I am no longer afraid to die record the world is a beautiful place is a Willimantic Connecticut band they're from my neck of the woods and for a little while now they have been playing an amalgamation of indie rock a little bit of post rock some emo to the suburban blues a touch of punk as well a few years ago they made their commercial length debut with whenever if ever in-between the release of this record and their new record they had that between bodies EP which I did not like at all I thought was loaded with tons of pretentious horrific poetry but thankfully none of that makes it onto this new record over here now recently the group has been signed by none other than epitaph records which is pretty awesome and it's exciting to kind of see not only the band growing in popularity but it's going to be cool to see if this impacts their popularity in any sort of way or kind of exposes them to new audiences and kind of seeing how other people react to this Connecticut band so anyway once again the world is a beautiful place has recorded at Silver Bullet studios and Burlington Connecticut and they ended up coming through with a very different sound from their past several releases these guys have been a pretty sizable band for a while now like eight or nine members or so however on their previous releases I've never really felt that large instrumental presence of a band with that many members but I think on this new record over here they're starting to really approach that you're starting to hear a wonderful and very clean and clear balance of all the vocals the sense the guitars the bass the drums the strings and now that the instrumental isn't as a wash and Reaver herb are kind of tucked away and and very far in the distance the band is using this very clear instrumentation to create some instrumental intricacies in these tracks and write some very linear and long and constantly winding songs a lot of these tracks are multifaceted and just kind of progressed from one musical passage to another tracks like I can be afraid of anything or Mountain hum or January 10 in a lot of ways the world is a beautiful place when comparing this record to their last they feel like an altogether new band and that's going to be a good or a bad thing for some people I personally felt like while I did like their last record a lot of things could have been improved especially the clarity of the instrumentation but for those who like their emo to be a little bit more I don't know blueprint maybe they're not going to be happy with what the band is doing on this record especially since in the midst of this transition I think the group has kind of taken on some characteristics especially with the vocals from the worlds of pop punk and pop emo but what sort of becomes an Achilles heel for me is the lyrics which are more upfront more clear than ever on a record from this band and they are especially weak on the opening track here where I find them to be just a little melodramatic however I do like the backing acoustic instrumentation and I love that little crescendo that the man reaches at the end of the track the post rock style guitars on on this LP while they are a bit cliche I think they're done really well and they sound nice and they they have this feeling of girth and weight and swell that gives the music a very heavy sense of drama so if you don't care for pop pop if you don't care for post rock if you don't care for emo or indie rock that sounds maybe a little Death Cab for Cutie influenced I don't know if you're really going to care for this record because these worlds continue to collide deeper on the record like on the track January 10th where a lot of the musical elements in this track are very familiar however I find the lyrics on the song be really interesting and atypical for music in this eyal the song here actually tells a story of a very real situation of a woman enacting a bit of vigilante justice in Juarez Mexico against a bus driver - who had a history of sexually assaulting female passengers the band basically endorses this action in the lyrics and I guess it just makes for a really interesting and intense song subject not really something a lot of bands sing about I think there are some kind of corny lyrical moments on this track though where we have a male voice singing in a very boyish tone are you Diana and then we get a female voice popping and saying are you afraid of me well yeah shouldn't I be the tone of the vocals don't really match the tone of the story and if you actually weren't paying attention to what was being sung in the lyrics you'd think that they were I don't know singing about a breakup or something again I like the instrumental on this track and I think the story concept is really cool but why it didn't dawn on the band that they didn't have to deliver the vocals and the same stereotypical Cadence's that many vocals are on top of these styles of music I don't know regardless I enjoy a lot of the linear structures and the bright melodies and the growing and falling rock instrumentation on a lot of the tracks that follow this one even if this instrumentation is kind of matched with poetry that thinks it's deeper than it actually is like on the song the word Lisa where we hear lyrics like break the mirror we get younger and life is always weird I just wish some of the lyrics on the track were just a tad bit more direct I feel like the world is beautiful places constantly giving the lyrics on their records this is very esoteric poeta sysm so that when you're trying to read into what they're saying you're only getting little bits and pieces of it I feel like they're either using huge words or they're leaving out bits and pieces of what they're saying just so that they can make it seem lofty and important and really significant but I do get a general sense from a lot of these songs that the and is rejecting a lot of societal pressures which is a pretty consistent theme in punk music I just wish there were more tangible themes a lot like on the song January 10th throughout the rest of this record with the track mental health the instrumentation takes a kind of folky rootsy turn I think this track instrumentally is like a perfect representation of like fall in New England it's like a wonderful freshly picked New England Apple but I think my favorite track in the second half here is easily the song when Dover one of the sweetest vocal melodies on the entire record I wish the band again not just lyrically but melodically like on this track which is a little more direct than they typically are and the final few tracks on the LP here are two of the longest and the track listing they leave this album off with a large gargantuan very triumphant feel as the record essentially kind of marches off into the sunset especially with the song I can be afraid which has a huge post-rock ish finish while the closer takes very more subtle and sombre approach and that's essentially the record I like it I like it quite a bit I think the world is a beautiful place came out with another good album however I wouldn't say I loved it I think the band transitioned into a new sound here pretty nicely but just like with their last album I think there is still room to improve I think there is still room to grow however now that they're working with an entirely new sound my reasoning is a little bit different the instrumental presentation I think was really nice I don't have too many complaints when it comes to that the vocals however I think could use a little bit more variety and the lyrics are a little too obtuse from time to time and again trying to force this sense of poetic is Amit doesn't necessarily need to be there and I think only makes it difficult for the band's music especially on the lyrical side to have any kind of impact I think there's a kind of interesting collision of worlds going on here because a lot of the lyrics do end up sounding a little sad or tortured in a sense while the music on this record is really ideal ik and sweet that's cool but it's a bit of a double-edged sword because I don't think the music really enforces the emotion of the lyrics a lot of the time and it ends up feeling like the band is trying to tease heart-wrenching drama out of emotional situations that don't really carry that much weight regardless as I said I do like the album I do think the album is very good and I'm looking forward to the next project these guys release I'm feeling a deist of strong seven on this thing transition have you given this record of listen I know like a little bruise on my face or something on order to try what you think of this album did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana the world was a beautiful place forever

everyone Anthony Phan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd do you know who it is and it is a brand-new episode of the needle drop podcast where on this episode I have a very special guest all of my guests are special I call them all very special I'm going to uh I'm going to tell the audience specific things that you do and and you tell me whether I've gotten them right or wrong gotcha okay my guest here he's an illustrator okay right mmm he's an animator mm-hmm he is a Kendrick Lamar impersonator mm-hmm he's that's my country yeah just doing that he is a DC inhabitant mm-hmm he's a podcaster and one half of the double d's he's a broken dick expert and my digs broken right now keep going he is a an amateur hostage negotiator I didn't know yeah you know actually yeah if there's a hostage out there right now I can I can get him out in one piece and also asexual extra bitch exhibitionist uh how many shitty glitched out boys things can I do right now no I yeah okay yeah I am alright and and also as I just learned a bit of an emotional yes that is the most true out of all those I'm more of an emotional eater than I am an illustrator that's my first profession is eating whenever I'm nervous Oh have it how much does that does that pay you get paleo emotional um like you get paid per like basically the based on the feelings you get so you you're weighed you're weighed beforehand you have these electrodes on your body and then you go and eat and then they test the brainwaves after you eat that Twinkie and then you're like oh the more brainwaves you get whatever whatever sort of measure that is the more money you get yeah well if it pays I thought I paid in pounds which I thought maybe you should move out to the UK that's that's legal over over there oh hey man I've heard some of your fucking jokes on that podcast well stinkers not like 90% of them I've been a fan of yours for a while actually actually since you you hit me up and was like hey man you wanna do an interview and prior to that I don't know how much I knew of your statue see maybe my stuff before them I don't think I came across it because at the time I mean your channel was pretty small oh yeah although at the time I was pretty impressed with some of the interviews that you had pulled up until that point you were doing an interview series where you would draw a portrait of whoever you had had on to the interview yeah man that was the meat that was the idea that really could kick me off I guess I guess you have a background in IT correct I do I do that's my day job that I hate that I'm desperate to leave okay and so when exactly did you start to kind of not to get into a conversation about something that you hate but you know has technology and computers has that been a passion for as long as drawing has been or for not as long or was this career move just kind of something that you knew would sort of pay the bills and you knew could kind of supplement you know your income and your lifestyle as you're sort of pursuing illustration and the animation that's a really good question um the short answer is that I think I loved computers equally as much as drawing since I was like six that's when we got our first Mac like a Performa I think perform at 575 or something and I remember um it's gonna sound cliche but I remember getting that computer I remember how that computer smelled I remember the sounds it would make I remember interfacing with this thing and being like I I wouldn't get the internet for like seven years after that but I remember every day I'd spend hours on this machine and just we didn't we didn't play outside that much I grew up in a really shitty part of Brooklyn back in the late night he's like I'm way before gentrification but it was like shitty so it was a good thing for us to be inside on the computer and I just um yeah interfacing with it just felt natural it felt like I needed I wanted and needed to know everything about this machine as much as possible and I thought I'm a computer expert but I mean eventually I ended up getting a job because I mean I'm I'm decent and decent enough at that stuff but um I think the drawing like I said I've been doing it since I was like six but I think I I didn't have an idea that it was gonna be a thing it was a something that I was good at or just decent add until I was like an eighth grade and then from then it's just been a steady kind of me trying to figure out where I fit into the where I fit into all of this and whether or not anyone whether or not I could make it different and sort of make any kind of money off of it I'm still trying to learn that stuff I kind of get this feeling that the computers and and that sort of technology is something that you kind of took naturally to where his drawing wasn't necessarily something that you were good at off the bat and that you needed to kind of teach herself but what was driving you to do that was was passion yeah man I think a lot about that word I don't even I really do think about that because I don't know that the traditional way we use the word talent and passion or even I don't know that it's even relevant I mean like but answer to your question um drawing for me trying for me was I was always a creative kid like you could ask me a question like you could ask my six-year-old self like okay where do where do flies come from and I could make a story for you that's not that's still to this day it's not hard from you can ask me something I'll just make up some bullshit out of my head so I think I always had that whatever that thing is that's installed and you that's like you give me a blank piece of paper like I'm dog shit at math but if you give you a blank sheet of paper I'll give you a story I'll give you some made-up shit but uh drawing from you I don't think yeah I I'm still not the not the best trash man if you just if if I'm going based only on um my drawing abilities I'm not the best I'm never going to be and that's one thing that I had to learn I think like three four years ago I really learned that I was trying to be for the longest time I was trying to be one of these guys who spends like 60 hours on a painting and then it's just this still image that you just hang on your wall that was my idea of what a good drawing or good art was and I didn't I it wasn't until I really started becoming honest with myself about what my capabilities were and what I loved doing that I started doing stuff that was sort of like my best work started when I realized I like when things move and they don't necessarily need to look finished but they need to move and they need to I like when images move and talk and sort of do more than just sit there and look pretty with one frame were you enamored with animation as a kid because I kind of feel like our generation especially in the 90s and and in the 80s too exposed to an incredible amount of animation actually maybe more than 90's than the 80s because you know a lot of cartoons were kind of relegated to you know sort of Saturday morning or just kind of when kids might be watching TV just in general where's a platform like Nickelodeon in the 90s was just throwing animation at you from night until day although you know they had Nick at night so you were watching the oldies shows on there which I don't even know if they do that as much as they used to but yeah I mean pretty much all afternoon you were just saying cartoons cartoon cartoons cartoons cartoons and I think as a result of that people who grew up during that decade kind of have a bit of I guess a soft spot for animation in general to the point where you know a lot of them grow up and they continue watching shows like Adventure Time and and and that kind of thing and and and also when those people grow up I mean you have more animation Moke open and more cartoons but they're for adults now you know it's South Park it's Adult Swim you know it's it's it's Simpsons although you know that was a already kind of I guess a bit of an institution in the 90s but that show was you know one of the first of its kind to be as successful as it was an animated show that was just more for adults yeah I watched so much Simpsons I watched a lot of cartoons but I would I would say that I think it I would argue that it transcends generations I say this because of I love watch I love art in general but even more than that sometimes I think it's really important and I love to watch people consume art you go through museums and you see like look at someone looking at a painting versus looking at a video it's like how much time are they spending on each one I would argue that from babies to grown-ass people grown-ass being like 40 i30 it above I think people are very much drawn to things that move and make noises because that's it's it tickles a different part of your brain something that still is I mean I'll just call it like it is it's not moving and there's there's less colors like there's a reason that well anything that's gonna stimulate more senses at work right now is is is going to unquestionably attract more people a so it has it has more to it again that was another that was a big revelation for me it's like I can't do one thing really good I'm never gonna be able to paint really good but I know that one of the compliments I get probably the biggest compliment I get it's nothing physical like the the the biggest compliment I get in my life is that people like my voice so they'll say oh you haven't deep voice you should do radio you should do something like that and it sort of clicked with me once it's like I have all these things I have all these things in this bowl and it's like let me just talk and draw and do all this other like whatever it is that I can do let me just do it all at once and what does that look like so the idea being it's like you use your voice with your drawing with um anything else that that's that's available to you to make something that's uniquely you so yeah you're right like stimulating more senses than just one because I can't I feel like I can't get someone with just me um with just a still image I needed for it to move I need for it of sounds to be incorporated I need to do as much as possible to make something that's that's me would you say that you're the type of artists I mean I think I already know how you're gonna answer this but it seems to me like you're the type of artist to really kind of you know is is where they are simply off of just kind of a I don't want to use the word passion again does it kinda you know it's fun you know but but I guess kind of just a focus and a drive that comes from just an interest in in that sort of thing versus I don't know what what some people would just call some kind of raw talent that comes out of Noble I see you're getting you know I know people would argue that and I have argued to people that people say yeah you're talented that's why you are where they are and any day I would rather have someone call me pastor and say that I worked for whatever it is that I have because that's that's the reality is like I I'm obsessed with getting hey what's going on it's my roommate I'm obsessed with getting better and doing doing the best possible job and if I'm doing better than I was a month ago or a year ago I I think that's that's great but I do have a really strong work ethic so sure yeah I'll take that any day over the guy who could draw really well from the beginning but is making stuff that's not that exciting or they're not that happy about it cuz I'm loving this every moment are there truly guys like that or you know is is that or is that just something that we assume kind of like what you were saying with a you know that person who you just just brought up kind of as an example you know we're not audience to that person's process of kind of teaching themselves to draw from the B game so as a result when we come across them doing what they do we're just like oh yeah that guy just got his raw talent has been amazing since he probably picked up the pencil I think there are people like john singer sargent is one of my favorite artists and he's he's like what you imagine when you think of painting from the 1900 well is let's say it's just in 1902 painting this guy you look him up incredible draftsman and this guy you look at some of the stuff he was doing it with like from 12 or 13 it's like right out of the gate he was just smashing just smack like effortless even when he needed to learn how to paint someone's nose he would just do it like a few times and he would just not that even work hard but I think there are definitely people who just their aptitude is higher like you only need to show them something of a few times or just once and then it's like they have it like know how to draw a nose for the rest of their life and there's some people unfortunately it was like it's gonna take them 500 times to figure out how to draw that nose but your questions like are there people who who know I mean you pretty much okay okay you know you pretty you pretty much answered it but uh but but going a little bit further back you you went to art school correct yeah I went to University of Maryland and it's it's a research university it's its science and tech and research but they have an art program there I just say our art school uni that's I went to the art program in Maryland so I got hard to be from there yeah yeah okay where were you were you studying computers over there at the same time or yeah I got my job on a kind of a fluke because I was I was lucky and I was good at computers and people like I know how to get along with people and those are being able to get along people is a huge huge skill um anywhere you go if people like you they will things good things will just happen to just for you from you trying to be good and and link people up but um yeah this yeah I studied studio art and over there it was pretty much their main they were kind of an abstract art school and they still are like then when you go to art school your your faculty determines what kind of curriculum you have obviously like what kind of stuff you're taught is the good art so you go in there like a lot of kids will go to school being like oh I had anime and manga and Batman is like that's the best kind of art stuff like concept design Star Wars paintings like that's the good stuff but they would they would kind of try and beat that out of the kids and teach them about Picasso and I don't know you know Rothko and whoever else you can think of who's kind of abstract now you you grew up in New York what what exactly attracted you to that particular University well I moved I moved down you live it you were living there no no I moved down here when I was I moved down to mid the Maryland DC area when I was 8 so it was was local it was the best the best school that was local to me at the time I was super religious so like I had my foot still kind of in the door above being a Jehovah's Witness so I I didn't want to leave too far so yeah I was a commuter okay and and that's another thing I kind of wanted to ask you about you know growing up with Haitian parents who you you were born in the US yes born in the u.s. you okay and and and your parents you know what what is it sort of you know like I guess in your experience if you could kind of quantify it or kind of put it succinctly in any kind of way I mean you know I think it's one thing to sort of grow up black in this country but it's also well you know another thing to grow up black but have parents who are you know first-generation immigrant you know fresh off the boat I guess yes a lot of people would say you know that has to be an entirely different experience in and of itself and also for them to you know have this very specific sect of Christianity kind of be their belief system I mean it just kind of seems like there's a lot of sort of separators yeah there between you and sort of what you would just call mainstream culture absolutely and I think that back then I think I used to feel I think everyone feels different but like you said there are a lot of separators and the religion specifically it was like they wanted you to separate yourself and they there were all sorts of things you're talking about the people that run the church yeah yeah that's yeah that's how it works the people in there sort of teach you to separate yourself like I didn't whenever there was like um Christmas or Halloween celebrations in elementary school I had to tell the teacher that I couldn't be there and she would send me out of the class like stuff like that but in in hindsight all these things really reinforced I think my ability to just if I'm sitting even though if I'm sitting by myself anywhere I can just I can just zone out and start thinking about stories or whatever I don't know if don't know if these things would have would have been inside of me if if all these I guess separators weren't there but I do know eight something that comes very easily to me um and I'm also not I am aware that I like when I was growing up uh it's like I got accused of talking white all the time but people would just make fun of you for reading it shit like that I get I didn't go to good schools into public schools but like I never felt as though what I was doing was wrong like I never felt like I needed to give in to be like anybody else because that's I guess that's sort of like the Haitian component where it's like you're not like these people anyway and I don't know if I don't know if you know this but like it's like Haitian people like immigrants don't see themselves as whatever it is that like they don't see themselves as black people like Haitians come here like in there a Haitians they're not black like blacks are like black Americans and they pass better for worse they see themselves as different so it's like you're not like those kids and it's just it was like instilled in me it's like I should never consider myself like them whatever it is that they're doing that's their business I'm sort of on this path so if I'm if I'm sitting there reading novels and comic books in gym class which is what I was doing it's like I'm on the right path whatever those other kids were telling me it was sort of like but on the flip side I can think of a lot of Asian kids who didn't who did sort of I don't know assimilate to what I've liked and and behave however like the American kids were I guess no I I mean I I sort of expected that answer I mean you know the my father is a and awarded you know weightlifting coach and I never knew this yeah and then one of his um you know closest friends who he trained and you know you trained at powerlifting meets with you know he's Asian as well and you know they pretty much have the same the same opinion about um you know what it is to be Haitian versus what it is to be kind of categorized in Americas as black you know it's it's interesting because you know it's it seems like you know you just you just had so many things going for you at a young age that were against the the cultural grain of of where you were and it kind of seems like you know you just kind of shrugged it off and you're like whatever you know I'm just doing what I do despite the fact that it's not what everybody else is doing yes because you just and I wish I wish more kids could could think like me look at me visit this beacon of hope and act wage upon me no but um I would have I really distinct moments in my life and my brother was also a big influence on me were just like cuz he and I he's the only other person who had the exact same upbringing used me so I could talk to him about that's all the time but like so he also reinforces like these ideas about like okay so it's okay for me to be had to work and do whatever but I remember he wasn't really interested in fitting in either oh absolutely not no less than me because he doesn't this thing that I have about reaching out to people and making art and all these magical things that sort of move around and make noises so I can get girls to pay attention to me or whatever whatever the fuck reason I'm doing all this and reaching up for attention or a love from people he doesn't need a tea doesn't need that yeah so yeah I'm also where this is this thing that I needed which is I mean it may be like the nature-nurture thing where I just it's just inside of me anyway but um doesn't make a great point oh why I could I could go off of that if you don't know what your point I I do remember I okay it's real quick I remember their distinct moments in in my life like read my first Stephen King book and feeling like I don't know who this guy is who wrote this but I was probably like in seventh grade I don't know who this person is but they they sort of understand me on some wavelength like I'm tapping into something I think I actually met him in sixth grade when I started reading his books his books but that was a super Angela thing for me and from then it's like you're reading even more weird of looks and like okay there are other people out there who are have these fucking weird thoughts like I do and it's not it's not bad you know that's funny because um you know I've heard a lot of people say certain things like that about you know certain pieces of art or certain artists of whatever medium but I've never had that kind of experience honestly when I've enjoyed much of anything you're saying when you were younger you never had that moment where you're like I'm connecting with this person today they sort of get me I know it sounds cliche you know no no no and I I really have it and I know it does sound cliche I mean I've heard a lot of times in the punk scene you know that right I was but the thing is like I never really got the the the sensation that when I was listening to something you know let's just use music as an example because music is is what you know I enjoyed the most when I was you know younger and what I enjoy the most now but I've I've never listened to a record and and gotten the sensation that man this person gets me you know III I think the closest I've come to that is that you know I listen to the record and I feel like I understand the artist or at least what I think the artist is portraying themselves as and and I think that that's really interesting you know but but the thing is it's it's that kind of emotional connection and that's that kind of point of view that that you know causes the situation when I review something negatively and then somebody's like fuck this asshole this guy because because the thing is you know a lot of people when you don't like an album or don't like a movie or something you know that that that they feel like you know this gets me you know when you could cheek that when you just like that it's like your critique them right you know and your disliking them because some people feel like this rep this represents me you know and and I think that there are some records out there that I really enjoy that maybe I I think I might connect with on an idea logical level or maybe maybe I could say if my personality was a record it could sound like this or it would be this specific album or something but uh but even so when I go to eat up the finer details I'm like oh you know I don't like that or you know I would never say that or something what about now you know okay we're not talking about your 10 year old self now are there moments where you consume a piece of art visual performance you know quesadillas and Cheetos you eat something whatever and you and you think to yourself this is transcendent this thing is what I've been looking for oh sure absolutely you know but I don't think it's uh I think having a moment of ecstasy and transcendence with art is different than feeling like the art represents you or the vision some kind of dance around now it might be a semantic thing it might be we might have to sort of describe what is it I don't necessarily think so I think they're two very different things and I think they're different things in the in this way I think I think the transcendent kind of thing and you can tell me I mean if this is not how you're imagining it to me the transcendent thing the the the thing that is so amazing it's kind of like you know staring at a wonderful huge gigantic piece of architecture or something that's just so huge an awe-inspiring you know it's it's so grand and so amazing and so well executed that it really has nothing to do with you whatsoever you're just in awe of its greatness of course you know that's all based on your perception so it has a lot to do with you but you know I'm not really thinking of myself at all when I'm thinking of those moments I mean actually I think the way the reason I prefer those kinds of moments are that makes me feel that way is that I actually you know forget about myself as a person for a moment it's like I or the world that I exist in doesn't even you know isn't even real the only thing that matters right now is this thing that I'm observing whereas you know the other thing the flipside that we were just talking about is something that I guess it kind of comes down to relatability you're kind of feeling a little less lonely ruled or yeah you know to me art that I'm in awe of doesn't you know make me feel less lonely it doesn't even make me think of loneliness or me or anything you know those more about how great that that piece of art is whereas you know the the the loneliness and the relatability and and that sort of thing that's that's a different that's a different thing and and certainly you know that there are records that I have felt like over the years that you know I relate to in some kind of way but I mean I I never really feel like an album has gotten me you know maybe I'm not listening to the right artists I don't know I do still think I mean that second thing you described me being made to feel like you're not alone is that probably described that that's a better description of that feeling I had then saying uh something gets me because I've never really liked that phrase but the idea of being not alone is a probably more powerful way to describe it because it's like okay it doesn't under like this this object doesn't understand me whatever that means but this other person who is here is sort of like it's almost like if you were looking at a glass cube with some hamsters in it and one of the hatches is like it's kind of strange that we're inside this cube right and the other ones like holy shit I have these thoughts - that's crazy does it make sense okay yeah no I think that's the feeling I've been describing on a very like micro sort of yeah ya know it's it seems like maybe these are feelings that someone who considers themselves an artist is tends to have a little bit more or maybe somebody who is a maybe more of an emotional sort I mean I've always considered myself to be like a little a little too pragmatic you know to kind of sort of have I guess those kinds of emotions you know those feelings of loneliness kind of drive me to be doing anything significant although you know I think is interesting about you and sort of what you're talking about when you're a kid is that you're not really necessarily looking for acceptance and trying to fit in with with the kids you're not really worried about kind of following the life path that a lot of other people are in order to you know kind of portray outwardly as somebody who you know I'm just like everybody else I get it just like you do you know we're all into the same stuff we're all thinking the same things so so you have that opinion you have those feelings but simultaneously you're trying to reach out and connect with people but not through fitting in but through absolutely yeah you've got it perfectly that's great because um the feelings I got from consuming those novels and you know playing video games when I was an adolescent just like final fantasy seven for instance like those those memories asked anyone who's played five as he's seven when they were an adolescent that that game is just burned into your memory and it really just it is this thing where you're where even if you're talking about the game you're really you're all talking about this experience that you add and then this kind of this bonding thing through the art and not necessarily like you doing what your cool well you're supposed cruel kids at your school we're doing that's not how you were bonding you're bonding through these other things and this like you're you're raising all these sorts of like ideas in my mind like I'd love to see like a cross-section or sort of like how like like what kind of people think about art in these these different ways like who's thinking about it in terms of it being this thing where you have to like it obliterates your sense of ego or your sense of self is that a good thing versus is it making you feel like you are with other people and is that a good thing and you know honestly I think the same piece of art can elicit those two reactions it just kind of depends out of that just depends on who the person is really and and sort of what they look for in art I guess you know I and and maybe this is something I'm more tending to to do these days because of just kind of my job but you know it's I'm not really in the business of trying to you know sort of try to analyze and think of the artist behind the music I'm listening to you know I'm just trying to think of the music that I'm listening to you know I want I want this out so I can monetize it and let's let's exploding just exploit these guys so coca-cola can get their money alright do it sorry go on there's probably I'm gonna put it I'm gonna put a youtube adsense commercial right here I'm gonna try it I'm gonna try to get it to be a coca-cola preview but I have no kin I have no control over this right as I'm trying to say profound things just throw a coke at right in the middle of it you know I just feel like the world is just you drink a coke you fuck your you're lazy and you need to drink this to feel better yeah I hate it when a commercials try to portray like this uh anything having to do with being meaningful you know like like all of it like oh you're your soft drink is just like super super important to the emotional well-being of so many people I've been tuned to that now and you can tell by the music they play where you have this chorus of people and there's like all this twinkling and the fifteen-year-old cube boy and the thirteen-year-old cute girl are holding their cokes together like yeah it's a warm and fuzzy and it's like what does this have to do with me drinking a sugary like fluid man and there's like some really just like a crappy pho commercial indie pop hanging in the background that has like you know a bunch of like boys and girls going you know with like some acoustic guitars and electric guitars kind of twinkle and you're not fooling me motherfucker but the other thing I think about is like if you had a coke commercial where it was like you see this large bloody field and just like this naked woman with one arm it's crawling through it and she's like I lost my family I'll and she says I lost my family 30 times and she drinks a coke at the end I'd be like this is the greatest thing ever I was a kid I had and this is like maybe a junior higher so I had this idea in my head that what would make for in amazing ruffles commercial is just like a really like a person in a room sort of like I guess like an all-white room maybe in like a straitjacket or something and and just like screaming his back for 30 seconds and just like just like have it cut to him like you know screaming a different part of the room it's a very small room so then you could throw a camera up in the corner and just you know now he's screaming in that corner he's screaming that corner now he's like running into the wall or something and and then you know and then just have ruffles come up or something you know I thought in junior high I thought that would make an amazing it still would I would buy that bag of chips but I would choose I would buy a bag of ruffles tomorrow I know though that the majority of people would be like what the fuck is ruffles saying this isn't it doesn't make me feel good I don't feel I don't feel night than nice and fuzzies when I see that group was commercial but I mean I don't know the Internet has opened the the the world to a lot of different weird advertising concepts although they're they're mostly just for a comedic end though you know they're not trying to weird you out in kind of a Twin Peaks kind of way to try to get you to buy ruffles I love that yeah so um so things like you know like visual art like final fantasy you know is is is it easy to actually let's kind of Center in on the final fantasy kind of the thing here Final Fantasy and video games first first huh before you continue did you play any Final Fantasies yeah you know but I caught up on it or I played it on Super Nintendo whereas I'm kind of getting the the feeling that you that you weren't playing it on that plan I was I play four four six and seven or my first one and eight actually I went to steppin okay seven eight six four but anyway you can continue so so yeah you know IIIi have played the Final Fantasies on Super Nintendo I didn't get PlayStation you know I was playing like Nintendo 64 so you know I wasn't playing like a lot of those bigger Final Fantasy titles on on playstation where you know a lot of people sort of I know that some of them were out on Nintendo 64 I think oh maybe I'm wrong I think some of them were I know they had crystal chronicles on GameCube but I don't think there's ever there was ever a Final Fantasy on until in 64 yeah I didn't end up catching up back with Final Fantasy until I got a PlayStation 2 and then they had like Final Fantasy titles given yeah that was pretty good one um so although at the time there there were other RPGs I mean I was probably more into Zelda and we're in a secretive man okay okay Chrono Trigger now we're fucking that that's my new that's my new catchphrase you like that oh now we're talking okay that that sounds like a that sounds like a good catch with she just say it in your in your board room meeting say it in the laundry line say it when your mom calls you to dinner Oh sir are you are you using this at work oh yeah now we're fucking Dominick did you get did you get those TPS reports completed now or fucking Alex outside of context you want you want to get lunch now we're fucking all right I'm done good let me know how that goes it's terrible I'm homeless now my catchphrase ruins my life but I can't stop music yeah sorry I was gonna ask you this sort of stuff these video games Stephen King novels stories and narratives visual art you know is this the kind of thing that that you look back upon more fondly than maybe kind of I guess your history as a Jehovah's Witness or even your cultural roots I mean do you feel like you identify more sort of just with your artistic of tastes and pursuits and just kind of your I guess your experiences with with art then then you do I guess kind of a where you feel like you're just you know happen to grow up culturally or religious wise and then that sort of thing because it's it seems like that sort of thing sort of very nostalgic for a lot of people for you it just kind of seems like it happened right absolutely and I think now we're about to get into some deep stuff I'm just gonna like dip my feet dip my toe in the water a little bit there are Jehovah's Witnesses they're cult and I had the disassociate myself from a lot of stuff I experienced because it's just it's years years of repressed feelings and missing out on so many things kids should and I think I I don't look fun back fondly on that because it was a lot of it was shitty like for me to just I still have nightmares about going to church it happens to me like every now it's down to probably like once every two three months I'm locked in churches and I can't escape even when I want to so like that that part of me like I just I do look back on it as something that just happened but all of the video games the books the music and stuff I consumed that was my choice and that's something you as a as a Haitian American it's like you do feel like you're in these two worlds because it's like at home you're eating like my mom and platon and like Creole and stuff like that but like your friends aren't doing that and you leave your house and you're in a different world almost but you have these choices you can make like I can choose what kind of books I read no one's telling me what to do I can I can play the video games I want and even in those universes you get until you can make choices as well so I think that also helps I mean helps people like I would imagine a lot of people like sort of assistive themselves out of bad situations but in their childhood by sort of understanding that in these universities you can make choices and maybe that's a reflection on your own life but I do definitely look more positively on my creative endeavors and stuff I chose to do unlike being forced to go to church and that's where stuff which was those sorts of nightmares - those influence your art in any kind of way or have they I guess influenced any sort of narrative or anything or is that something that you know you just rather not even indulge in when you're sort of you know making the choice to do something you'd rather do I'm not actively indulging it right now but I think I think it's so built-in to me that I mean let's take Quinn for example in hip hop RPG Quinn is this recurring character that um through all my stories I think for the past ten years whenever I write a story I always end up writing about like these female telepaths who are some kind of stuck stuck in some kind of cult situation or getting killed or something like that and this is a recurring thing and it might be my subconscious trying to work something out I mean Quinn escaped illuminatus he might be the representation of Jehovah or something or he might just be I have no idea but I think subconsciously I'm probably working out a lot of issues in my art but I do consciously want to work on these things and put them out there even though honestly it scares me because it's it's really close to me like these concepts of but what does it what does it feel like to be a Jehovah's Witness I haven't consciously tried to touch that I mean I'd love to after hip hop RPG is done I'd love to try and work on that and see what it feels like because I don't I think will be a unique unique experience for me and maybe the people watching because I don't I don't see many animations on YouTube about what it's like to be stuck in church you know I see a lot of like joke cartoons about like Sonic the Hedgehog but I mean like all this other stuff that is what's important to me do what I mean that's that's a hot trend and you're not even capitalizing on it you you haven't done not one meme Sonic in and I mean how about all that sanic train but I might I might put sonic in church and he doesn't want to be in church with those Chaos Emeralds being thrown at him but I might just kill a few birds with one stone yeah in church they don't allow him to go fast they tell me I gotta go slow but I don't want okay I just wanna be fast my friend Hopson okay who talks exactly like me because I can leave in one type of I saw this amazing video on that clickhole youtube channel click click hold the the sister site to the onion where they just kind of make that fake click bait site the the the video is about how this amazing new video game was breaking I guess gender barriers with this really amazing female lead character and it was just a bunch of screenplay of Sonic the Hedgehog it was just a bunch of screenplay of Sonic and Tails and the woman sort of narrating it was like you know Sonic is breaking the gender barrier by featuring a beautiful blue woman who goes very fast and collects rings and she was also saying that the blue the beautiful blue woman who was the the protagonist and Sonic was also deaf so Sonic the Hedgehog was as a woman and deaf as well fighting not only gender barriers but disability barriers as well and it was just just in insane Nicole was doing God's work click hole is doing God's work um so uh I want to talk about hip-hop RPG but just before we do that I do want to talk about video games specifically and dive into that a little bit more because I feel like you know that that influences you know sort of what you do in the hip-hop RPG so much so so I I imagine as a kid you was there any kind of limitation to the stuff that you could be playing and you know on video games or you know what were video games something that you took to later as an adult when you had more control over your life or that's a great question alright um so I was raised by my aunt and my aunt she she like pretty much ruled with an iron fist in every realm of my life except for what I consumed on the computer and with books and it was one of those things where it's like she's in Haitian immigrant she has enough enough like worries trying to take care of two kids with with her her job or whatever and yeah she's like okay these kids are on the computer they're reading books I don't have to worry about it they're pre-act right meanwhile at least they're not outside gang banging they're not fucking girls they're not they're not stealing they're doing fine price but I'm sitting there reading books when I'm six like in the seventh grade about dudes killing men women and children and just running around in different universes like people dying and all kinds of weird shit happening but I was just loving it and I think so there weren't restrictions every once in a while she would she would see us playing like a first-person shooter a Final Fantasy game and she'd be like this is demonic what is this what did you doing and we just be like just shake her head and just leave and to this day like she recently threw out all my video games that I had at home all my video games dummies and comics because she said this demon stuff fuck but I would say there were only like two or three times I can remember where she actively took a book I was reading and threw it out because it was demonic Lord of the Rings being one of them and that was widened never finished that series because I was so furious that she took my Fellowship of the Ring book and threw it away so there were restrictions but there also weren't like if she had been a super good jewel was when this Christian I would be in trouble right I probably would be talking to you because she would have been burning all of my video games okay so so so you did at least have enough time and enough exposure and uh you know an enough leeway to sort of play something like Final Fantasy 7 and you know out of Ed of all the different artistic mediums that you were into and you were younger I mean were video games something that you felt the most drawn toward I mean a you know if there's another thing that aside from animation that I think you know our generation had the unique I guess kind of position to be like first exposure on an extreme degree you know it's it's definitely animation and then there's videogames you know which I mean of course they've been around for decades before but I mean video games really flourished in the 90s not only in terms of just their popularity but also the graphic quality as well you know you could even though you know the graphics aren't as good as they are today I mean you know that was the first decade where you could see like blood and Mortal Kombat or you know that kind of thing and you were able to make your own choices in these games you could and nowhere near as much as no but that was a big thing it's like if I want to play this way I can do that um yeah video games are probably the biggest like artistic medium that that in effect on me you might I watched a lot of cartoons and movies as well but um video games were definitely like I it definitely affected me on a really powerful level just being being involved in all those universes and making choices and uh yeah big stuff aside from final fantasy are there any other video game franchises that that have a really strong impact on sort of what you're doing with the hip hop RPG uh I think I'm pulling the most from that but I think there are other you know had impact um not if I'm RPG I don't think that I don't think so that's gotta be the biggest one I mean yeah I'm okay okay well then that's that's fair um so what is it about I guess Final Fantasy especially you know this this kind of older era of the franchise that made you kind of want to recreate it kind of in this new animation you know with these sprites and and and also you know what were you as enamored with I guess the the it's it seems like somebody who's so young who was really drawn to books you know RPGs like Final Fantasy would be ready really because so story reading I mean there I wasn't as big into RPGs as I was other games that were maybe a little bit more action driven but I remember my father like video games as well and I remember I remember if I was ever at a point where I was playing an RPG he would just be like look what the fuck are you doing this is like boring as hell you you you pressed the you pressed the fight option and then he went to go hit him and then it said like 53 what the fuck is that you know what's 53 you should be dead won't you please WWF yeah and you know and I like those games as well and you know my dad was a Mario Kart addict who loved some Mario Mario Kart he was just he just liked some some racing bullshit you know but uh you know that that was just a really you know fun fast easy straightforward concept to grasp and you know sometimes he could kick my ass in it so you know that he liked it you know wears like an RPG it wasn't uh you know it didn't have that competitive sort of nature to it and you know it's meeting it's about you experiencing this universe on your own no it's it's kind of like the video games answer to a book you know and and and the thing is you know if I wanted a book I just go read a book you know I but but but but still um you know I I imagine you were really enamored with the the story of these Final Fantasy games absolutely because it's I mean this isn't that was it Mario shit I mean just playing playful fantasy seven I picked that up on PC like a year after the game came out and I just knew sort of what it was about and I didn't I wasn't even aware of what I was getting into it just so you go from you go from pong to see Ruben Mario Brothers which was Super Mario Brothers and Sonic is what I was playing when I was a little kid until I was like like twelve thirteen and I got five as he's seven and then all of a sudden you're involved in this story that is so deep that you're spending seventy hours on it and main characters you you grow with them you train them up you give them items and sort of understand at least on a superficial level who they are like you you sort of had all these different like character characteristics to them and if I've asked yet seven specifically they kill one of the biggest main characters and that was a huge thing and I was just sitting there like this is a beautiful experience for them to just like you don't get that in Zelda you don't get that like like link dying high a halfway through or some it actually wouldn't be linked it'll be more like princesses yeah the storyline isn't anywhere near as Germany right and and the thing is you know while link while it may be a great game story lion wise it's pretty cliche absolutely all of them are I mean I still wear soccer you know time was really good but it is still really cliche it's like he is the good great adventurer and he does good thing because he's good and I fuck out you that shit yeah I mean the Final Fantasy characters as far as storyline goes there they're definitely more complex than any kind of other major RPG yeah so I mean it's it's it seems like you know that complexity and those sorts of storylines have really kind of impacted what you're doing over here with art with the hip hop RPG really looks which you know models itself after a lot of those older sprite based RPG type games and features a cast of characters that are just pulled out of mainstream contemporary hip-hop you know featuring Kanye Kendrick Lamar Drake and right now you're five episodes into a five and and and is is this the kind of thing that you know how many episodes you're going to go until you're done or are you just kind of doing it as it sort of requires you know do you know how it's going to end right now yes um I am like 95% sure how long it's gonna be I want to do ten episodes total and we're gone six right now okay and I I want to stop it from my sake because I know um originally I had like 16 17 episodes right now and I at some point I had to stop like this is crazy you have this we had a bunch of episodes just like storyline wise written it yeah yeah and this is Jeff or you've even begun an exactly and this is just like we were talking about with the IPG is like you just you place so many of these games that are so deep and have all of these these tendrils of story coming off of them and I was reading like you know a Stephen King book that's like nine books long like one series and you just like I I'm emulating that because that's where I come from and I love long convoluted stories but I have to rein myself in that's one of the hardest things to do but I know of I'll also thank myself for it because this is a very long project I'm used to very short stories like boom get in and out but this is a kind of a huge undertaking for me but I know where this is going mm-hmm okay so I mean you're pretty much dead set on the idea of there being just like 10 more episodes yeah yeah I'm dead set on it because and this kid I'm working with would you rocket from from the UK he's really good at he'll tell me when with some ideas you'll be like yeah you know I mean maybe you could trim that off if you want to but then you'll give me some awesome ass idea like oh yeah what if what if Action Bronson is like riding in a desert and it's like a post-apocalyptic wasteland I'm like that's so fucking awesome wheel we don't have the resources for this you know at the time so I I really had to rein myself and I'd love to keep this thing ongoing but I also want to move on I want to move on the shorter stories that don't have to do with hip hop RPG at some point because it's just I love doing this and this is I feel like it's my greatest story work and animation work but it's a lot of work it's a lot are you at the point where you're where you're sick of it yet I'm not sick of it but sometimes sometimes it feels like I just want I just wish it could be done but I know I know what it looks like in my head but I also know that realistically it's like I'm gonna need two years to take it's like you're taking the biggest dump that's what it's like that's a really great comparison yeah it's just a steamy shit you can look at online sorry this is I'm really selling this are tied these guys just out there clicking you take the clicking to go check it out right now so so for anybody who's listening right now and this is one of the main reasons I invited you onto the show to talk about the hip hop RPG because this is sort of what you're putting most of your creative juices behind right now yeah it's so open one to this so you know can you sort of give the listeners a bit of an elevator pitch as to what they can kind of expect or sort of uh you know why they need to go check this series out all right I can say right now there's probably I think they're you've never seen anything like this I can say that yes I can say I mean it is true it is super specific and it's it's like imaginative elevator pitch were an elevator thing I'm pushing for 13 whatever we're gonna die so as this elevators rising we're dying this animation is about you picking up a game in a pawn shop a game that never existed you're the only one who has it you put in your Super Nintendo it's about a bunch of rappers fighting Illuminati aliens in a post-apocalyptic future it's like two worlds colliding that you would never think would collide oh yeah and that's that's the best part of it to me it's like and and and the thing is the people who listen to my or watch my show and listen to my podcast you know who considered themselves to be music nerds and specifically hip-hop nerds and you know and and love their kendrick lamar's and their Lupe Fiasco's and and that sort of thing you know I I think that they're gonna enjoy this because the thing is you know there's also a lot of music humor on it as well or just kind of you know you're taking these real life people you're putting them into this completely made-up fantasy band but you're you're sort of applying characteristics and sort of personality traits that you know that these artists have at least you know in in the art that they create and you're applying it to this you know fantasy story absolutely like I mean the biggest ones should be each character for me had to have a nugget like you said some truth to them in terms of how they how they behave or cliches about them just being funny about it because I can get I can get super dark and have things be like just blood and sadness everywhere but I needed to take I needed to make it as funny as possible in this dark world and I mean the biggest one that was just a gimme it was just so easy and I think is the strongest characterization is like Drake is a white mage he heals people that's his thing he doesn't fight he's only concerned about making sure you have enough health and MP to go on and he's like a peacekeepers people are fighting he's like stop you all we need to hold on like that type of thing but that's so uncharacteristic of his beefing now he's he's beef yeah but I think that's all I think it also makes it funny it's like he's his white mage but he's still like you're you're right though but it's like imagine him imagine a white mage just trying to act to me and it's like he's you know it's it's it's true though because the thing is uh you know the the the the problem with that is and we could talk about this is that you know you're sort of coming up with characters based off of these artists who you know are are evolving in their own right right you know I mean when when you initially start this series you know and Kendrick is sort of the lead role and he's saving the world and and all that I mean when you started this series to pimp a butterfly wasn't right you know so I mean you're trying to come up with this cohesive story line that goes from beginning to end you're asking the audience to buy into it while simultaneously you know these people are in the public eye and they're sort of doing things that have nothing to do with this story that you're pulling together yeah I have thought about that I am a slave to current events like if someone puts out a new album like an episode for I don't like shit I don't go outside I'd just come out and I was like I want to use that I got a yeah I got to put that in somehow and then the next episode when when Earl comes out I incorporated that into his character anyway it just happened to be perfect perfect for it but I do yeah things are it's it's to me it seems to be living and breathing it and it's not gonna be just one thing like if if Kendrick comes out with an album you know six months from now and it's in something - perfect for me not to use like I have that incorporated so it's also this this is the most challenging story ever in and I don't really feel like sometimes it's super challenging I had to sit there like what the fuck am i doing like how am I gonna make this work and make it current but it's it's super fun and it's also like a child it's a big challenge for me to figure out how do I work these things in it's like how do I work in to pimp a butterfly you know I I did luck out because in Episode two I I made the idea of a mind worm before to pimp a butterfly came out and it was and I love that there are parallels between this giant worm that you're inside that's providing energy to something and the idea of this caterpillar consuming things and eventually turning into a butterfly I mean this is like loosely I guess there's some loose parallels there but I lucked out I think people might think I did that on purpose but I didn't at the time it just kind of worked up you you should you should say that you did do it on purpose because you knew Kendrick was calling you and he's like you know you already know what he sounds like you do perfectly I called me actually I he called you and he said what should I call this next album you know I I'm really inspired by this mind worm that you that you've pulled ahead gentlemen these album was to quit use vectors right he's sitting there turning his grave right now cuz D respect is dead you know honestly like I feel like your your Kendrick impersonation is is dead on in terms of you know the yeah like a Frenchman just like a little like I just yeah but I feel like you take it ten steps further and you just make it a friendship I do but it makes me laugh though how bad it is because especially like it when you're making someone like D respect angry it's great anytime you can do that but I know it's shit and I know it probably annoys people so that makes me happy or to that is not as accurate because you brought him up let's just go into the the podcast little the the the podcast that you have with D respect called the double T's podcast which I will link you guys down to in the description and and I'll just put it bluntly they just kind of talk yeah you know and it's a lot of current events stuff and just kind of things that they just have some personal feelings on and you know could be some media stuff could be politics could be whatever they just kind of talk it out you know however the thing that kind of perplexes me and and this is really all i want to ask you about the pockets and you can kind of say whatever else you want about it after this is I just kind of feel like U and D of the podcast world or just like you know just just basically the odd couple of the podcast world I mean you know he's basically Klugman and and you're Oscar you know you're kind of the cleaner nicer more well-mannered more cultured and you know just I guess kind of more well-meaning guy while Dee is just kind of this brutish you know weird gross you know a little bit more vulgar though you're vulgar to yourself you know but but I guess you kind of have a bit of a an artsy Flair to you it just kind of seems like to me on the surface that you two just have so little in that way does it because there are so many moments during the podcast you know he's just like oh that's just some dumb you know shit that you're just into some dumb indie or whatever shit I haven't heard of that artist who cares you know or when he's like trying to talk about sports and he's like you're not even into this stuff so you know just very often I'm not into it but that that's the thing no in the great thing about him is he's deceptive he wants you to think that he's some some meathead jock but he's not he's super into the same stuff I am and you'll get these moments where those are my favorite moments of the podcast are when we're both we both me that this in this point we're both talking about super abstract weird art shit because ultimately we were very similar but I think I think we do I mean it's kinda like we fall into these hyper characterized versions of ourselves cuz that makes it that makes it funny because we can shit on each other but like we are very similar though yeah I mean it just kind of seems like both of you have these primary interest which don't really line up but you have a lot of secondary interest that that maybe go a little unnoticed unless you've listened to many episodes of the podcasts that are very much in line with one another it seems like both of you really like you know discussion podcasts comedians philosophy and and it seems like that's you know you have enough second-tier interests together that that the podcast actually goes over really nicely and that you can kind of maintain these discussions and and you both kind of end up I guess butting heads a little bit on kind of the these more major things but you kind of have this underlying foundation underneath it all that kind of keeps it all flow yeah definitely I think it feels like doing a podcast it is like some somehow it's like you're you're jumping off of a cliff into this abyss but you know that at some you're gonna land you're gonna land on your feet every time having a having a conversation with him it clicks it's always clicked really well from the beginning and it's like we could talk about I feel like we could talk about anything for a really long time it we probably are losing people we're talking about below 80 or submit by our three but I mean that's that's really the power of you respect is he can take something and really run with it and I can I can be like oh shit that's great you brought up this thing it's it's super fucking fun you guys should watch the show or listen to it there's no there's a watchin yeah I mean it's it seems like he's having fun to it to having fun with it as well to the point where he's not even you know keeping up his usual YouTube content prior to meeting you which is originally what brought you two together to begin with I think he's cooking up some some major stuff and I don't I I think the decision to put on his main channel it's like we'll get some some bigger viewership um I think we should probably put something back on the d top podcast channel that show like yeah we went here a little but we're just trying things probably yeah which trying things out or moving around and ultimately sort of what-what are I mean you can't speak for deep I can't I can actually I'll speak for Kenya okay so speak for him right now and tell me what the ambitions for the podcast are correctly and just kind of you know your your relationship together um our relationship together really get married probably and that's legal yes but um our ambitions I think just to just to keep going and having the good discussions we have um having more guests on your welcome whenever get making it bigger I just bigger and sense in the sense of getting more listeners um hopefully just I don't really just taking it wherever it goes as long as it's fun and we have good conversation which is just that's inevitable it's been a blessing that great guest you've had some of the most fun discussions I've had like we've wrought episode like 118 which is we've talked for a hundreds of hours at this point any including I know it seems like we don't it seems very scattered rain and we both are but beforehand we do have an idea of where things are gonna go so I know things uh yes so we do we do talk a lot outside of it well where things are gonna go um I'm really proud of our skits I think we have really super weird a skits you guys can listen to the skits have gotten funnier over it oh great man cuz we and and more detail - it kind of seems like more discussion goes into this yes oh absolutely yeah we do every time we come in with like yeah what if what if you're zombie and some shit tab I don't have to be done in these zombie things we do have move fluke - which is that we've created a lot of crazy-ass characters on this show on the fly we create like new food - is this this Haitian warlord demon really likes Nice Kicks uh yeah I wish that has to come up a little more often yeah a lot of weird stuff it's great yeah I mean I think you guys could actually you know just probably put out some videos here and there of just those sketches you know every once in a while just come up with a standalone an audio sketch I think that would be really cool you know you guys really seem to be really good at it and it's it's sort of a the highlight of the episode some time although I think my favorite part of any not only a recent episode with any episode is when Dee was trying to tell the story about the guy who walked through the store with the blu-ray and you're like why are you behind the counter and he's like listen to me he's like I don't get it why are you behind the counter I legitimately did it I'm just you tell me the story out of like you didn't understand which is why it was so this store trying to buy something and then like I didn't understand why he was bribed to counter of something and I just I have to go back and listen that would actually be a really good time too because Skinner said I've replayed it new really time well I mean I have listened to so many episodes that I know what he does for a job I don't realize why you didn't sort of realize what he was talking about right from the get-go just like I had a brain fart but you at some point I got of it I knew we had a bit at some point like probably like a minute into me saying I didn't I didn't get it I just started laughing cuz he was so bad that I didn't understand and I do that even if I did understand at that point I was probably gonna push it a little harder cuz it just it just had to be funny you just find all these little bits and these little caverns in your mind that you can go down because in a conversation and then and then at the very end I think you guys did like a presidential sketch or something and then you were like I don't know why by aborted yeah it was a good one so yeah definitely check out their podcast it's a very very fun time and to end off I would be remiss if I didn't at least ask you at least a couple of music questions so that so that people in the comments could make fun of you for not having a patrician sort of next level which is very high level tastes like everybody else who watches my show oh man let's go I just now we're fucking you got your own fucking catchphrase you fucking loser you forgot your own fucking you said you said your own catchphrase wrong yes you just said let's watch but like you fucked up your own catchphrase no that works in the streets my friends Jesus I was just gonna ask you you know sort of what you know we're at the the second half of the year you know list season is probably gonna be coming up really soon unless the world ends next week and it will and it will and it will so you know let us know right now what your favorite albums of 2015 are so that everybody knows that before they die you know some what your favorite records of this year have been thus far okay um is the pimp a butterfly 2015 or 2014 it's 2015 bro put that shit at the top alright okay and then put depression Cheri okay wow you really love love beach house Matt are you excited for the next record yeah thank your lucky stars I'm waiting I'm waiting I'm just I'm charged up right now charged up like Draya my hands are glowing like Sonic the Hedgehog you know I'm saying I'm ready to go depression cherry throw-in currents and tame impala I love currents and uh I think I think those are the big ones yeah those three I know that you saw them this year you saw Death Grips this year yeah you know where does the powers-that-be sort of sit on your your favorites list um I've only listened to Illinois oh you know you're not as crazy about really no not really I mean I gotta listen to it some more man like I really don't yeah it really didn't I gotta listen to it too more as this I get into these moments with albums I I will choose like four or five albums and just listen to them over and over again it's hard for me like of course I love the signals from the powers-that-be like I I listen to all right I'm gonna say this I'm gonna sound like a fucking and plea per se but like I listen to on GP and I'm like this to me sounds like it's like a crazy beautiful symphony like it's just it so it's almost like and I feel like an asshole because I'm saying this yet I only just on an album like twice but like on GP for me is like it's a beautiful crazy so I imagine I listen to that it sounds like the us it sounds like I get this picture of the u.s. being um like an idealized but somehow post-apocalyptic form of the US like you'd hear in some kind of alternate universe commercial about us propaganda does that make any sense no it doesn't but anyway yeah so but but those other albums that you've listed you you've been returning to those albums a lot yeah absolutely I listen to him all the time hmm yeah I mean I've returned to uh to pimp a butterfly tons of times um although I will say I myself haven't returned to the powers that be at least not many times after the release of the record I at least for maybe like um you know the album came out I listened to it a ton of times to review it loved it thought it was amazing thought it complimented the first disc of the album really well Jenny death you know really enjoyed it and then after I dropped the review maybe like a week or so after I dropped the review it's not that I didn't like the album or that I didn't like any other of the other Death Grips albums but I just I think I had burnt myself out on them god damn I really did and and and then I went to go see them live and for the second time - motherfuckers - not a lot of people can say that sometimes Death Grips two times two now we're fun now we're fuckin oh hold up MC ride seeing my catchphrase continue and then and then after that I kind of feel like I did enjoy the show I thought the show was great but uh I I think that kind of solidified the mood that I was in where I was just like mana burn out on Death Grips right now I'm just like praying they don't come out with anything like for like two years or something and and it wasn't until I think just the other day you could you could check and see on my Twitter account when I was listening to them the other day at the gym I was just like you know I should listen to this again and then I didn't I was like yeah this is great oh man but yeah I essentially burnt myself out on them for like a minute and I just didn't want to listen to any Death Grips like you know I I look at the money store and be like the bad thing again like oh man I listen to that thing so many fuckin times but that's the thing you know it's like you could as much as you might enjoy stuff you know you could really burn yourself out on stuff and the thing is that's that's kind of a position I haven't really put myself in for for a long time because there are a lot of Records that I remember I play over and over and over when I was in high school and albums that I think are still really good today but you know even today I don't even really you know have any kind of intense passion to listen to any of them because I just played them to death when I was in high school in college you know I just kind of know them like the the back of my head the back of my hand if I ever want to listen to them all I need to do is fucking think about it just yes you burn it out I'm getting there with I think the past that would go butterfly I still listen to it a lot but I my god man and then I'd you to the point you start skipping tracks oh geez III heard you in the podcast once you were like talking about some wack lines on that record what did I say I think you pointed out the the line where he said I remember in the podcast you said this line was wack when he goes he gave us Billie Jean you think he touched this kid is terrible no I like it not not that not that listen it's it's not that I disagree it's just that I thought the way that you put that was really it's it's a shit it's a black line because it's like it's like that's the reason Billie Jean is is the reason why you touch those kids that saw they made means that it's like is that what you're gonna say in court Kendrick Thank You Lana I can prove to you that he did not touch these kids man check out these out of them listen to that shit man and the judge is like you what the shit is hot is my case of the fuck you well it's true it is really it is shit logic yes as much it's it sounds great and as much as I love that record it's not good logic it's not I mean you know kendrick could go out and sort of kill a bunch of people tomorrow but you know nobody would say in court it's like hey man he gave us to pimp a butterfly you think he did that you think he killed all those people you think you know that but man listen to this fucking album and the juries like you like acquit this man hey I mean at least honestly like I wish he would have just come out and made the argument that if you make an a piece of art that's great enough it should just you know completely uh just exonerate you from any bad that you do that's basically what he's say like if you're if you're a great successful artist you should just be allowed to just laws should not apply what if he's wait I'm above they're gonna blow your mind I'm not to blow your dick right now all right so what if he's saying he gave us Billie Jean do you think he touched those kids what if he's saying that you you really think he touched those kids listen to this what if he's actually saying listen to Billie Jean what there's there's some stuff in your manual do you think he touched those kids like what if it's a question of course it's not but that's this alternate universe that's alternate universe Kendra questioning Kendrick Inquisitor Kendrick I'm imagining I'm imagining an alternate universe or the only thing that's different is that line is just the work created it's like all this potential stuff people could be flying a BB gun no it's just one mine and it's not even the line is that is that different the lyrics are the same but the thing is he says it with a different inflection oh my god says it with he says it with the inflection of a question rather than an exclamation we figured out interdimensional travel what is the place we get there psyche what is there's no difference we spent all the resources on earth to try and find a new world that's different nothing yeah and then someone discovers the difference says I've got it good I think we're gonna leave it at that my guest Dominic Raburn thank you for coming on the show and talking about what it is you do and then thank you for giving us this wonderful catchphrase which I'm sure is going to catch on and on the engine listen your fault now we're fucking on a needle drop broadcast thank you for having me here and thanks for supporting me being a friend and it's really fun to be at a different position like I always feel weird being interviewed it feels like being in a spaceship that's not of my creation but this is a really fun spaceship is a fun space you created you're really good at interviewing this is great great questions awesome stuff um love your work of course good stuff now we're fucking Howard fuckin cat neh I'm gonna bring them together now we're fuckin forever 
y8JUeP3ODic,ah hi everyone roar thony roar tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of new churches album every open eye churches re Glasgow pop and electro pop trio who broke a handful of years ago with some fantastic little pop singles like recover and the mother we share I think churches went on to hold their own onto a debut EP titled after that recover single however I think they rushed a little bit into their first full-length album we're about halfway through the LP I think the band displayed a little bit of a lack of ideas still I thought this help you did have some decent tracks on it I for the most part enjoy Lorin Mayberry as a singer her voice to me is a little childish a little light on the ears but I think she has some good range and she certainly sings with conviction on some of these tracks especially during the big loud booming choruses she has range and I think churches as a group has potential more potential than they displayed on their debut record however I can't really say I was excited going into this new full-length album because none of the singles really piqued my interest however a cowl is definitely looking forward to it I love you Laurie now you love you older I can't believe you said that you sexist pig well on this new LP over here churches don't really change anything up in any significant way the production sounds a little boo me kind of gargantuan a little more high budget but that's about it a lot like purity ring earlier this year I think the band is kind of taken a step toward glossy gutless nests however the separating factor for me between churches and a project like purity ring is that Lauren Mayberry can be an exciting front woman although I think she does better over a lot of the peppier more explosive tracks in the track listing here when it comes to subtlety and and and maybe intimacy I don't really think she has that much to offer especially during the very subdued closing track on this record we're not only hear about the instrumental itself just is really drab and kind of bland it's a bit of a directionless cliffhanger here not the strongest writing on this record though interestingly enough the very finish of this track in a way sounds like it sort of sets the tone for the intro track on here almost as if you could just kind of play this album continuously in a loop and there's never really a point at which it sounds like it should stop maybe unless you kind of get tired of it then I guess it should stop the intro track on here though never-ending circles it's a decent song it's got blossoming shimmering choruses that are really bright kind of catchy even though almost every single thing in the mix here sounds synthetic the instrumental presentation still feels very large almost as if I'm listening to a full band or something the the sound is very wide it's very panoramic even though it is kind of sanitary in a sense the song leave a trace as well has a pretty sharp chorus too and when these courses burst in Lauren makes sure to really pick up the intensity on her vocals she sounds really in sync with the instrumentals here however I think the verses on both of these tracks and on other tracks here too are totally boring and insipid and under written it's almost as if churches is taking the approach that so many other pop acts do and that's that they just underwrite and completely neglect their verses to the point where there's nothing really interesting going on lyrically or melodically so that the course is sound even more important than they really are the first song and the track listing here that I love from front to back is the song keep you on my side which comes right out of the gate totally fiery with a bustling instrumental just a very busy set of beats hanging in the background Lauren's vocals quiver with passion in the instrumental here when the chorus breaks in there's just this pumping dance beat and there are these really pretty synth flourishes that are kind of dancing in the left and right channels this to me is an excellent example of churches pulling together a song that is beautiful but also has a lot of pop but after this the instrumentals and even Lauren herself head in a really mild direction like on the song make them gold or on clearest blue where the only saving grace of this track is the pumping loud thunderous bridge on the back end of the song on track six churches tries to pass off another song without lauren Mayberry's vocals just like they did on their first album there are so many formulas that are running parallel from their debut record to this record over here and just like on their last record the singing is not good and I have no idea why with such a capable front woman they would continue to put tracks into their records especially with subpar vocals that don't feature her for me this is a record where I was hoping that churches would come through with some more bold and distinct ideas and take a few risks which i think is necessary for this part of their career especially considering that every single girl producer duo or trio wants to be this group they want to play with this sound and they're copying everything that churches does but instead churches is just simply repeating themselves and tossing out mediocre tracks like this now the fire on this record comes back with a song empty threat didn't love that vocal melody on that hook oh there's some throbbing old-school synthesizers on this track and some really righteous lyrics coming through on the song too however I still can't help but feel like much of this record just feels like a high gloss high budget repeat of what we heard on the last album which I guess if you loved the last album that probably won't be too bad of a thing but for me what was an issue on the last record is that there were a lot of tracks that paled in comparison to others because the writing really wasn't that fantastic and that's essentially the case once again on here there are at least a handful of songs on here that I think are really fantastic but for almost every track on here that I think is great there's another song that I am skipping immediately while a whole bunch of other tracks just kind of meet somewhere in the middle of being fantastic and just being a nightmare I'm pretty indifferent toward this record overall I'm feeling a decent strong 5 on this thing Tran have you given this wrecker to listen if you did you probably enjoy it a lot more than me and that's completely fine you don't have to be indifferent about this album like I am you can enjoy it that's totally okay but if you enjoyed this album more than me which you most likely did and you're pissed off at this point in the review and you wish I was dead do your best to explain in the comments with out wishing death upon me to tell me what about the album appeals so much to you cool cool have a good one bye 
jBXlxCnGXks,hi everyone fight the new rainbow here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new new order record music complete this is the latest full-length LP from what I feel is one of the most significant pop and electronic music outfits of the 80s and and maybe the most important music act of the new wave era in addition to dance music trailblazers I guess not inventors but people who if they did not make the music that they did dance music would not be what it is today I like them a little bit more than Joy Division though that's neither here nor there they made one killer record after another in the 80s from movement to power corruption and lies lowlife Brotherhood technique so many good albums their discography gets a little spotty after that however I've never really gotten the impression that new order was the type of group to just continue releasing music to hold the attention of what they have left of their fans just to maintain some last shred of relevance still much of the output this band has had since the 80s has just been okay nothing really so bad it's unbearable although maybe that weird b-sides collection they just came out with sort of borders on that regardless I was looking forward to this new album over here quite a bit because it is their first studio record in ten years on the keyboard Gillian Gilbert is back although Peter Hook is gone which kind of sucks I like Peter Hook and I did enjoy some of the singles leading up to the release of this album like plastic and Restless it also seemed like there were some interesting vocal guests and musical guests appearing on this record people like La Rue and Brandon Flowers of The Killers as well as Iggy Pop who is probably the most prominent vocal guest on the entire record sort of providing this weird gravelly creaky voiced monologue on the top of the song stray dog a song that not only feels out of place for this record but feels out of place for a new order and Iggy Pop's vocals feel out of play so over this somewhat plain flat synthetic dance pop instrumental I think the only upside of this song is that it certainly makes picking my least favorite track of the entire album easy the bulk of the other songs on this record though are really refreshing and fun and poppy and catchy updates on new orders typical sound it's like listening to old school synth pop and dance music with those classic new order songwriting chops but with some more modern cleaner just punch your production what toolpusher ol Papale pachie pitchy bit me cheese yeah stop interrupting oh I was on a roll I had a good momentum going and then you killed it you're just a big grouchy Eggman eggs um I'm really liking the song writing on this record for the most part I think the vocal melodies and the hooks on a lot of these songs are super sharp as are the verses I like the song singularity a lot which has this driving drum be in these glassy synth melodies that are really fantastic Bernard Sumner's vocals on here still kind of have that melancholy boyish tone to them that I've always liked and on the song nothing but a fool I love the refrain on this chorus over here where it is sung sometimes you don't know what you got and the string sections in the background are really warm they're really inviting and this track to me while it does sound new in terms of production it just kind of feels like this lost New Wave gem just sort of brought to the light and on the song academic there are some very anthemic guitar leads and keyboards which are really great and I love the refrain on this track as well yo hot is code in your blood man's dress it's really moody the verses are really moody and kind of sensual as well the instrumental I think is a little plain a little flat I think new order while updating their sound they kind of hesitate to lay on a lot of the digital effects that I think would have normally been in their mixes back when they were recording analog maybe they didn't really care for the sounds of any of these digital effects or maybe they were kind of afraid of laying them on heavy whatever led to the decisions that were made in the mix and the production on this record some of these songs do instrumentally sound a little one-dimensional like there's just not much space between all the instrumentation like things are just a little claustrophobic now those are songs that I like those are tracks that I think are great in the track listing here songs that I think can go toe-to-toe with many great new order songs in the band's back catalogue however there are songs on here that I don't care for at all stray dog as I mentioned earlier there's the song tutti frutti which to me is incredibly goofy especially with these weird deep gravelly Italian vocals kind of popping and occasionally just to say a word or two kind of reminds me of like what Daft Punk was trying to do on their last full-length album except nowhere near as successfully and people on the Highline feels like this weird disco flavored funky tune with a bassline that makes me wish that Peter Hook was back likewise why is this bassline here don't don't do this to me guys and on the song unlearned this hatre the keyboard loops on this record are probably one of the most obnoxious sounds on this entire record sometimes when new order really tries to go for something that I I think they're I think what they think they're doing is maybe making dance music electronic dance music that is a little bit more new and refreshing but rather than coming out with something that would be very much today I feel like they're only dabbling in stuff that would have been trendy like in the late 90s or the early 2000s or something every single time new order tries to do something new ish it ends up sounding more dated than the timeless sounds and songwriting that they've come to be known for overall I still think this is a decent record there was at least a good half for at least two-thirds of this record that I thought was really good very enjoyable very sweet well-written the production can be a little plain but at least the instrumentation is is is well balanced and audible and just a well arranged and put together especially when some extra stuff like strings pops up in the background and it does end up sounding nice but there are some glaringly bad tracks in the track listing here where it just kind of sounds like new order after all these years is just kind of getting a little indulgent and deciding to do something a little unexpected but every single time that happens on here it ends up sounding like the band is falling flat on their face unfortunately but still those moments where I think they do play to the strengths that they've built up especially during the 80s where they came out with some of their best stuff sound really good I'm feeling a decent strong six on this thing Tran hey how you doing thanks for watching the review I appreciate it you mean all the way to this point that's really nice or you skip to the end just so you can see the score and yeah it was a 6 another one shut the up anyway what did you think of this record did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana new order forever 
ZLd80ase-GE,ah no thony more tan oh here the Internet's busiest music turn and it's time for review of the new Alex G record beach music he is a singer-songwriter from the Pennsylvania the state of Pennsylvania and he's come to be known on the internet for a series of homespun releases which kind of took off on Bandcamp took off to the point where he had labels scouting him out his last full length album DSU got a Rough Trade records reissue and his new album over here came after a domino record signing which is pretty nice now personally Alex's music has never really struck a chord with me or made me excited in any kind of way so I basically went into this new album over here uh looking to be surprised not really totally knowing what to expect because Alex never really came off to me as an artist that had that distinct of the style or sound a lot of his previous releases to me read a little bit like rehashes of a lot of 90s indie rock and Lofa rock music so maybe Domino records and all of this recent attention on him and his music could tease out alex's potential again didn't totally know what to expect coming out of this thing so I gave it a listen it's a short LP 13 tracks or so though a lot of the songs in the track listing here are somewhat brief and Alex covers a pretty impressive amount of ground throughout all these tracks we do have straightforward indie flavored somewhat old-school rock songs we have some stripped back more acoustic cuts on here songs that are more synthetic keyboard based kind of ambient very vast and glistening we have the very precious cute little duet tune bright boy and a lot of these songs flow into one another making this record feel kind of cohesive they're actually some production techniques and little I guess editing quirks that I haven't really heard many artists in this particular style use maybe some weird vocal manipulations or some strange noises here and there and and even though alex does experiment occasionally or changes styles nothing on this album really feels too out of place or too out of reach either I think the one track that sticks out is just being unlike anything else and and maybe not in the best of ways is the intro which features the stuttering drums and screaming vocals and very noisy layers of guitars and it sounds really quiet super lo-fi and nothing else on the album really fits the tone of this introductory track it's pretty much everything you're not going to hear on this record am i in the first track from the music no no you're you're not okay so so I minded ablum no god I would I would hope not I would hope not and I hope that continues to be the case I hate you and I wish you were I wish you were dead again or in hell wherever you came from okay so this intro track immediately transitions into the song bug which is a very laid-back low-key stringy indie tune which is a dead ringer for a Modest Mouse instrumental if you just pulled Alex's vocals out of the picture and Alex sings in this very kind of lazy melancholy slacker type of way and doubles as vocals up for the effect of I don't know a sound that's a little Elliott Smith ish but the tune itself the alex is singing isn't really that bad and the instrumental is well put together it's I don't know I guess got a lot of detail to it but listening to the first few songs off of this record and Alex's past work I really have no doubt that he is everything he's been hyped up to be in terms of being authentic and just being very emotionally real and his songs but the thing is as a singer-songwriter and as a personality I just don't think he has that strong of voice some of Alex's lyrics and tunes and vocal deliveries on this record are outright flavorless drab and boring especially on tracks like mud I fail to even see the purpose of the song walk in the tracklisting here which just kind of sounds like a short filler in strim ental with no real beginning or ending that has a bit of lead guitar that to me reads a little too much like Mack DeMarco but when this record does manage to win me over it does it with some beautiful and well assembled loafing music more than it does with a strong and winning and sharp and and smart and interesting singer-songwriter personality and thankfully that happens somewhat often on this album like with the track thorns where I'm loving the doubled-up guitar arpeggios but interjecting between the very sad and somber verses that are very keyboard heavy it's a sweet little instrumental alex's falsetto doesn't sound too bad either and on the song kicker I think the guitar lines on this track are some of the coolest pieces of guitar work on the entire record it's got a really odd group to it I love the way that the guitar sync up with the drums and I think that there are a lot of moments here where what this album doesn't have in personality it makes up for and just cool creative musical ideas Alex takes really well to a synthetic drumbeat and some heavy keyboard layers on the song salt ball and I love that little about the vocal refrain which is a very nice and sharp catchy point on this song this track of the song look out they're really just synth intensive and especially look out which feels like it has a bit of an ambient vibe to it even though these songs are very light they feel a little aerial pink inspired in our two of the more distinct moments on this record and then following these songs we have the very heart melting bright boy and then with the song in love we kind of get a piano ballad with I don't know maybe one of the odder vocal deliveries on the entire LP I guess in concept I kind of liked this track and I don't mind the tune or the lyrics but the vocal delivery here just feels like such a put on the last few tracks on here are tad bit generic and maybe our our few of the most unmemorable moments on the entire record Alex really doesn't experiment as much on the back end of this record as much as he did in the middle of this album I definitely see the appeal of Alex gee I think he comes up with some interesting musical ideas and I think that there are some people out there who have a bit of a soft spot for the nostalgia of the 90s when it comes to indie rock and alternative rock and low-five music and Alex certainly channels a lot of those influences well however I think he kind of fails to put an interesting or even his own spin on it quite often often enough to make some of the tracks on this album kind of I guess drowning in their influences a little bit I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing transition have you given this record to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Alex G forever

will actually leave an email address down there in the description if you would like to reach out and possibly send along a question for a future episode so here we go I have three questions here I'm going to address each of them in this podcast and just kind of give my thoughts on everything posed by the people who sent these questions along here we go we have an email here from Michael Michael says hello my name is Michael thank you and you've got me hooked on your video since 2012 thank you but my question is how much emphasis do you usually put on lyrics when you are reviewing an album of course this does not depend on the genre as rap and hip-hop is usually based around the lyrics but I would like to know what your stance on an album that may not be that they may not stand strong instrumentally but lyrically my main reason on asking this is because I saw your y-you know review for August of 2015 and you called counterparts tragedy will find us paint by the color metalcore however many reviews have praised the lyrics on the album or the musicianship so my question would be according to whichever the genre of music you're reviewing how much emphasis do you usually put on lyrical content and delivery I think the amount of emphasis that I typically put on lyrics sort of depends on the amount of emphasis in the amount of care I see a lot of artists put into their lyrics now that's not to say that you know lyrics are just kind of checked off and completely irrelevant if it seems that an artist isn't a great lyricist I mean in the case of someone like little Wayne or young thug yeah do I go to their music really looking for lyricism no are there good you know redeeming qualities about their music outside of lyricism absolutely but the fact that they are saying not much of anything for such a long amount of time does kind of drawn me admittedly and and there are some artists who I guess you wouldn't necessarily call lyrical but I find them funny and entertaining because they have a sharp or I guess somewhat tongue-in-cheek or delivery that is a very full of life or animated in some kind of way a guy like ASAP ferg kind of comes to mind or even I want to say riff raff comes to mind as well riff raps lyrics I think I put a lot of emphasis and I put a lot of attention on his lyrics when I'm listening to a riff raff song because I think his lyrics are really clever and I think funny and I think he puts a lot of personality into his lyrics do I observe a riffraff verse in the same way that I would a nas verse or something like that or a Kendrick verse of course not so I mean of course I put emphasis on lyrics but I don't think there's one good way to write lyrics I don't think there's one right way to write lyrics that doesn't mean there aren't lyrics that I hate and lyrics that I think are awful and lyrics that I think are crap there certainly are but I think guys like riff raff make lyrics that are entertaining I think artists like Phil elrom of the microphones make lyrics that are interesting and intriguing as well again I think it sort of depends on how much of an emphasis I sort of see the artist putting on the lyrics let's take for example a guy like Jay retard certainly he has some okay lyrics on his songs rest in peace but a lot of his lyrics tend to be kind of redundant and simple and blunt mostly for the sake of kind of making the songs that he's writing very simple and blunt and energetic and visceral because he's writing punk tunes you know garage punk tunes in a sense so I don't really go into his songs to kind of eat at his lyrics and observe everything that he's trying to say lyrically however though sometimes ignoring the fact that the music can sound a bit dry or flat or bland because I don't care for a lot of his studio work I put an immense amount of focus on to the lyrics of one mr. John Darnell of the mountain goats who you should check out their latest record which is a kind of a very interesting series of stories and tales and vignettes that are pro-wrestling themed you wouldn't think that a singer-songwriter would I guess delve into such a topic but he does so for an entire record and it's it's his knack for lyrics that allows him to do so knack for lyrics and his knack for storytelling I again I don't really think it sort of depends on the genre I think it depends on the artist specifically because in each popular genre that that lyrics are kind of a focal point there are examples of not only awful lyricists but great lyricists whose appeals run far and wide now I I don't think and and of course I mean there are examples uh I guess on both ends of the spectrum the mountain goats being one like I just referenced where sometimes the lyrics are so great that the music it can be okay but I'm still kind of enamored with what's going on in the song because the lyrics are so good and then there are examples of records where the instrumental is so great that I guess it doesn't really uh mmm I want to say cross my mind as to what the lyrics are doing or it's not you know that great of a factor for me I guess maybe an example would be maybe ASAP Rocky's Live Love ASAP or something not that the lyrics they're bad there's certainly not I think a lot of them are catchy actually however I wouldn't say that ASAP Rocky's a star lyricist I guess I enjoy that album that mixtape more for its vibe and its aesthetic and its instrumentals and its hooks then simply its lyric certainly the lyrics are fine they fill the space left open by the very spacious beats and I think the mixtape wouldn't be as good as it is if ASAP rocky didn't have some semblance of character or personality to what he was saying and his flow and his delivery so you know he certainly got that I'm not taking anything away from the guy but uh that that's not really a record where I'm trying to eat up every single thing that he's saying because he's not trying to tell a story or anything like that I mean there's a lot of I guess uh vulgarities and braggadocio and that sort of thing you know it's it's nothing too deeper or anything like that and and the thing is I think um I think it's fine for music to be that way sometimes yeah you know I think there are some albums certainly you know whose lyrics I'm enamored with so much that that they may overshadow the music however I can't really sort of I guess uh Coralie some kind of trend for me with with particular genres I mean certainly there are hip hop albums that I've enjoyed that I've gotten comments saying Anthony what the hell's wrong with you this guy's lyrics are stupid this guy's just making you know crappy pop rap or whatever you know however I think the lyrics maybe have different qualities different entertaining qualities other than that you might find on like another hip hop album I like this year like czar phase for example you know this is very specific type of lyricism that I think you know mmm it's great and it's fine and I have nothing against it I mean some of my favorite emcees you know are cut from the same cloth the guy like inspected Decca's or at least a very similar cloth however you know I I don't think that's the standard every single hip-hop artist should be held up - definitely not that would be like saying every guitar player that doesn't play like Jimmy Page isn't you know living up to the standard of what guitar playing should be it's ridiculous so I mean I I think again you know I think it depends on the emphasis the artist him or herself puts on their lyrics you know certainly I'm not going to I guess I guess downgrade an album for the the lack of flashy guitar playing if the only you know guitar playing that we hear across the record is just some rhythm guitar in the background oh there's just not enough flashy guitar playing on here sort of like a it would it would kind of be like demoting LCD Soundsystem's sound of silver for saying though there's not enough guitar-playing on here you know I mean there's certainly a lot of keyboards and bass guitar and drums and vocals but not a lot of guitar on LCD Soundsystem's records and and and it's fine you know I think it's I think those records are great but you know I'm not going to demote those albums for you know not having a particular characteristic or not kind of expressing that characteristic in a in a certain way so I I suppose again I I guess I don't really sweat the lyrics of like a Ramones song you know as much as I do like a Dead Kennedys song because Dead Kennedys are are quite famous for making some really strong political statements in their music I don't really sweat the lyrics too hard of I guess I want to say maybe a Meek Mill song though I do like meek Mill's music at least on his newest record however I don't really find however I do sweat the lyrics of an artist like PJ Harvey who on her latest record I mean she put in quite a bit of effort with making a lot of political statements and telling a lot of stories on her new LP let England cake or even Bjork with with her recent record kind of being a breakup album with a lot of those themes coming through in the lyrics again I think it just all depends on how much effort that artist puts into their album as far as the lyrics go if the lyrics are passable and they're just okay and at least the singing is good to me that doesn't really take away from the album or it doesn't really you know add to the album it's kind of like a neutral factor however I feel more impressed by a record if it seems that the lyrics are telling some kind of significant story or the lyrics are really clever or making some interesting point or really evocative in some kind of way so yeah I mean I certainly think lyrics are important but how important they are I think depends on how important the artist in question makes them and I think it's up to as the listeners and reviewers or whatever to kind of pick up on that and I think it's just kind of best to take it on a case-by-case basis you know not like rock lyric should be this rap lyric should be this or whatever singer/songwriter lyric should be that I I think you know we should take it on a case-by-case basis and in the sense that okay this particular artists making this particular album I like these lyrics and this is why or I don't like these lyrics and this is why okay thank you Michael for for that question appreciate that email moving on to our next question we have dear Anthony I just recently started watching your videos and I am very glad that I did as I very much enjoy them I've got a question that I would love for you to discuss on one of your videos recently I watched that movie about Amy Winehouse that came out some time ago although I absolutely love Amy's music I asked myself whether we're not only overhyping her because she died at such a young age under tragic circumstances and at the peak of her career from then on evolved the question whether we do that with other artists for example Kurt Cobain as well do you think that if musicians like them hadn't died in that way they wouldn't be as famous as they are today and do you believe that other artists like for example Eminem had dried died tragically young and at the peak of his career before material like encore had come out would he have reached more of a legend status sorry for all the mistakes that may have occurred English is not my first language with all my love Yasmine Desmond thank you for the email I appreciate that and I appreciate you watching thank you all right so these artists kind of dying at the peaks of their careers dying young does it cause us to overhype them you know I think at least in the case of Kurt Cobain and Amy Winehouse prior to their deaths they had huge huge records they had gigantic records huge hit songs so I mean I think in the case of both of them while yes their deaths were untimely and they were very tragic while these people were alive they were incredibly famous I think it's not so much that they're not here that causes us to be so intrigued by them you know like if Kurt Cobain for example were just a regular average dude and you know didn't have the emotional problems that he's that he's so well documented as having and one day for example he was just hit by a bus or there was just a terrible accident that you know was really nobody's fault you know just a complete mistake by chance that took his life and he left this planet and as a result you know he was passed on and he could no longer make music III don't think that we would be as enamored with his memory as we are currently because the thing is Kurt Cobain and Amy Winehouse I mean not only did they pass away at a very young age but they passed away tragically and there's a lot of tragedy surrounding both of these people which adds to their backstory and adds to the backstory of their music as well I think another example is Ian Curtis of Joy Division you know these people they have very tragic backstories they're not like people who just passed away by pure accident out of the blue you know there's a very long and uh arduous story to how each of these people passed on and the thing is the general public the the general public they love drama they love tragedy and the thing is that the personal life stories of these artists who you know we're generous enough to sort of share their pain share their emotion with the world through music through some great music you know kind of broadcast this anguish to us with some wonderful art and we also know that these people sort of you know again hadn't let let sort of tragic lives which during the lifetime of Kurt Cobain and Amy Winehouse the general public was very interested in the general public at least you know people who were big Kurt Cobain fans were very interested in the emotions and the thoughts and sort of what exactly made Kurt Cobain tick and the same was for Amy Winehouse I mean Amy Winehouse while she was alive the tabloids chased her around every corner to sort of see her getting thinner and see her abusing drugs and see her inebriated you know the the tabloids are really wolves when it came to Amy's public life Amy's social life so even prior to Amy's death the general public was obsessed with with Amy Winehouse's life choices and you know her flaws and you know a lot of people saw the the writing on the wall and and knew that she was addicted and to various substances and and and abusing a lot of them very heavily and and and knew that if this if this person could take you down this road death was imminent death was right around the corner it was it was only a matter of when for a lot of people you know they saw that coming and the news media the tabloids were certainly doing their best to try to capitalize on it and sort of be be the first one there when it happened so that they could take pictures and broadcast it out to the world honestly I mean I think I I think people if Amy Winehouse and Kurt Cobain hadn't passed on I I think people still would have continued to be interested in them because their that their stories were tragic however if like maybe one day sort of on on their next on their follow-up records both of them had gone through rehabilitation got help cleaned up and then led very clean-cut normal lives after I guess battling their demons the general public's interest and at least their personal lives because their music may still be great the general public's interest in their personal lives would have just evaporated because they would no longer you know just be this sideshow to gawk at and stare at you know and and that sort of again just kind of been a characteristic of the general public's interest in celebrities for a very long time um you know look at somebody like Lindsay Lohan for example who people have obsessed over you know the her train wreck of a series of life decisions for years for years for years despite the fact that you know for a while she wasn't even like you know really making any good or really any TV shows or movies or anything but people are still interested of what's going on with her what it was she doing who's she drinking with was like you know what is she wearing all this stuff so yeah I mean I think the the tragic circumstances are kind of pivotal here to this particular situation I mean that they're artists that that pass away sort of at a young age but maybe not so tragically you know or not as a result of you know just very self destruct of behaviors you know and certainly we mourn them but there's not really anything for us to a you know to to obsess over in terms of them being kind of like a you know this this damaged personality or anything like that I think the the fact that Amy Winehouse and Kurt Cobain passed on the way that they did it just adds so much story in so much context and so much tragedy I I recently did a like a classic review for Nirvana's in utero and when you think of sort of what was going through Kurt's mind up until the point when he decided to commit suicide and then you sort of juxtapose that against the incredibly depressing and very I don't know self-destructive lyrics that turn up all throughout that record and just howl off its hinges it's emotional hinges that album is it adds a lot of character to the very tragic storyline of Kurt's death you know when you look at the lyrics to the final Joy Division album and then you juxtapose that against an curtis's tragic death it's sort of I guess intensifies the lyrics in some kind of way because you know the person that was on that album you know for them those incredibly dark thoughts on that record were very very very real to the point where it drove them to make the ultimate decision you know essentially so I I think you know especially in art we like our dark tortured souls you know as far as you know your your example with Eminem I think if Eminem had had died as a result of I don't know taking a little too far with the violence or the sort of the pills or the drug is that he was known for rapping about so heavily on his first several albums you know I think then people would kind of oh you know it's super tragic he was you know dying I guess as a result of you know his vices which were so proudly displayed in his music you know take take a look at people like Tupac and Biggie who both died in this incredibly tragic way you know if Eminem like kind of like my earlier example had died shortly after the release of Marshall Mathers LP 2 because he I don't know tripped and fell off of a building or something or like I said you know gotten hit by a bus or whatever a train or something you know it it wouldn't have really added to the story the tragedy the character or anything like that I was just life taken from us too soon people like story lines like I said they like characters they like Jarama you know somebody's life kind of being taken away from us by some kind of mere accident for no reason whatsoever you know doesn't add to the drama doesn't add to the character you know people again they love that tragedy they love you know a storyline like what went on with with Tupac and sort of the tension of the East Coast and the West Coast and and and and the fact that this friction this drama sort of took two lives of some very important artists in the history of hip-hop so I mean I think I I think death you know certainly has a way of I guess enhancing things especially if it is to a dramatic effect and you know if an artist does end up passing before they have an opportunity to put out a record that displeases fans I guess that's also I don't know I guess a way of death kind of in a really unfortunate way is kind of maintaining the the status of their music because we never have an opportunity to kind of you know watch these artists end up putting out an album that we think is disappointing and some kind a way which you know every artist does eventually but uh but whatever you know I think I think my I've explored this question as much as I can very morbid question but you know definitely something worth pondering and and I don't completely know if I if I came up with any significant or if I came up with all the answers for this but you know I think I've certainly tried to explain how I feel and I think we're gonna move on to the last question Yasmin thank you again for for shooting that to me all right our final question here let me just check on the time looks like we're almost about 30 minutes in thank you for listening again all right we are going to be taking a final question here from Jay Jay says sup Anthony greetings from the UK Hey Dude thanks for emailing me from the UK I've been a fan of yours your reviews for a while now I find them both entertaining and down-to-earth thank you and I have discovered heaps of artists through your videos so cheers for that I wanted to share a question that I've been thinking on for some time I think it's safe to say that on the whole artists tend to release their best music during the first half of their career the cliche of course being that you have your entire life to write your first album however I've noticed that after the principle songwriters in bands reached the age of 40 there tends to be a decline in the general quality of the songwriting perhaps because for most this is the point where you've settled down and therefore have fewer stressful influences on which to draw inspiration from writing music of substance many bands be they Green Day Radiohead Beck or even Paul McCartney seem incapable of capturing the essence of their younger selves having crossed that 40 mark personally I'd much rather that older artists turned to producing or man bands of the future as their expertise may be better used helping craft other musicians records rather than churning out poor music of their own in short my question is does musical life end after 40 I would love to know what you think about this and whether or not you think I'm totally right or wrong keep up the great work you're sincerely J plinth all right J um III I'm not exactly sure as to add to the exact age of any of these artists but there was a video I made a little while ago about this very topic where I had actually listed a series of albums that were late career albums in particular artists discographies that I thought were great and I will link to that video down there in the description one album that certainly comes to mind or one you know at least a few artists that come to mind who are coming out with some of the most riveting stuff around or past the age of 40 people like Scott Walker or Tom Waits or Bjork right now is coming out with some great stuff PJ Harvey who I'm pretty sure at this point is past the age of 40 is coming out with some great stuff The Flaming Lips are actually still coming out with some interesting stuff or at least are you know experimenting in a very in a very bold way on some of their latest records they're certainly a lot of examples I think I also want to say Shabazz Palaces Shabazz Palaces as well really the list can go on there's really no shortage of people sort of past the age of 40 putting out some great stuff mmm or at least stuff that you know really seems to be pleasing to a lot of hardcore fans I want to say Kate Bush as well you know I think it really all depends on where the music that the artist was making in their youth where that sort of came from emotionally and whether or not they still continue to try to make music coming from that same place as they have aged rather than evolving and progressing and creating in different avenues to me you know you cite Green Day you know who's early work I mean while I like a lot of green days early stuff it also comes from a place of anger and frustration and angst and what have you all emotions that are kind of hard to maintain into old age not that there's no reason to be angry when you're old but I guess it's a kind of hard to sort of be angry in the way that sort of an unruly teenager might be angry or twenty-something or something I've always kind of considered myself a very pragmatic person but but you know I enjoy a lot of music that is sort of over the top and and very heavy and very extreme like that you know I think napalm death just came out with a pretty decent record I think a converge just came out with a killer record and I mean geez they've been at it for decades at this point decades man yeah I mean I think it really all depends on on sort of how you aged with your art some people try to do the same exact thing in a sense that they were doing 10 15 20 years ago and are convinced that they can just continue doing the same thing and that people are just going to eat it up the new Interpol record kind of comes to mind which wasn't bad but I mean jeez what a rehash I think I think Paul McCartney I mean he's certainly evolved over the years and then he had some decently career albums but you know I think the thing about Paul McCartney is a I don't know if he's really you know sweating sort of putting out music as much as it used to you know I I think I think the thing about these artists is you know not just that they've aged but I think another kind of term and determining factor here is that they've all seen an incredible amount of success and maybe going down the road that has led to maybe less fire in their bellies because there's not really anything to prove at that point you know people have acknowledged them as great artists you know there's no question that they're great artists regardless of whether or not their next album is good beca's come out with so many color records Radiohead has come out with so many game-changing records Green Day I mean as far as mainstream pop punk goes their early stuff really doesn't get much better it doesn't get much better than their you know their earlier stuff you know and they and they were pivotal for painting the way for a lot of sort of those MTV level pop punk bands that would rule the charts over the years you know all of these artists have had an incredible impact on the art of popular music and I guess the wider world of music at large whereas I feel like a guy like Scott Walker an artist like PJ Harvey people like Bjork who you know always seem to get way more out of exploring you know and just kind of a the oddity of experimenting and trying something new more than she did I guess kind of the compliments that people would lavish onto her and as she stood in the spotlight you know the people like Tom Waits as well who's you know known for being a bit of a recluse and not really touring you know these people they really create because it seems like you know they've got to you know not not because it's kind of just their career you know and and not to say that that's a bad thing I mean you know people like Paul McCartney have an excellent business sense and and have has done great things with his career you know post uh I guess you know post putting out some of his greatest music you know so there's a point at which some artists kind of realized that it makes more sense to kind of just live off of their legacy more than it does trying to reinvent themselves all the time and I think you know at that age once they've kind of proven themselves and they don't really have anything else to to prove to the world or you know to kind of convince the world of maybe they just kind of you know except that which I mean isn't necessarily I mean that's that's kind of their right to you know in a sense I mean has Paul McCartney put out enough great records I think so you know if he wants to live out the rest of his career just you know being Paul McCartney the fucking rock god that's completely fine with me you know I have no qualms with that you know I I don't doubt that you know if Paul McCartney I I don't doubt that Paul McCartney probably has good music left in him but does he want to put himself through the process of kind of writing an entire album getting musicians together trying to get a label to put it out and taking the risk of I guess you know making it a really out of their record and doing something totally different and unexpected you know plus I mean you also have to accept that people like Paul McCartney he grew up during a different musical time you know does he want to necessarily adhere to a lot of the trends and sounds of today in order to kind of keep up with current times and and sort of compete with this newer league of artists not necessarily you know like I he's kind of proven himself you know he doesn't need to compete with any of these people who's Paul fucking McCartney he's Sir Paul fucking McCartney and and at this point I don't really think you know artists like Radiohead or Green Day or Beck really need to uh to prove anything I mean these people have have in a big way influenced the music of a lot of these newer artists they don't necessarily need to dive into the trenches and compete with any of them you know these artists are drawing inspiration from a lot of these people so so I mean I don't know I I don't think musical life ends after 40 I think there are just some artists who have seen an incredible amount of success and just sort of see the way of the future as just kind of embracing that legacy that they've earned for themselves and just kind of thriving off of that meanwhile other artists for whatever reason could be maybe that need to prove themselves is still there could be that they never really found that sound that they were totally happy with could be a bunch of other completely I guess undefinable factors there's some artists out there who into their 40s they're doing something totally different than they were doing in their 20s and it's still crazy it's still exciting it's still out there it's out there in a new way and and and I think artists like that are fantastic I think we need artists like that certainly there are some bands that you know should definitely throw in the towel if you know I'd rather a band do that then try to force something that they're not happy doing or just put out another record that sounds exactly the same when they damn well know that I have anything to say or you know offer that they haven't offered already however you know I still don't think that you should just quit because you're 40 you know quit when you don't have anything else to say you know quit when you feel like you've composed your last good melody and you don't feel like you can come up with another good one you know I feel like that's the time to quit you know don't quit just because you're a certain number as far as age goes you might still have a lot to offer the world who knows all right I think I'm gonna leave it there thank all thank you to all of you for chilling with me even though I'm a little tired and this is a pretty laid-back episode of the podcast but again if you want to submit any questions

weDCTRLky3Q,here we go hey hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the most arduous segment of this YouTube channel the monthly y-you know review where I go over a series of records that I haven't done a formal review of over the past month which usually leads to a lot of people getting pissed stopping like hey why are you reviewing this fucker you idiot I hate you I subscribe you you should go outside yeah so I I don't review some albums because I'm one human being I can't review all the albums I'm trying believe me I'm trying and if I could I would but I can't so I try to address some records that I've been wanting to touch down on in brief in these why you know review videos on a monthly basis like I said let's just get straight into it this new peaches record comes long after I guess her initial controversy with her earliest releases and she still comes off very sexually starved on this new record over here but also in a way mature - I like the skeletal beats and I like that she took a more I guess quieter approach with her vocals on this one very subdued album even though it is very vulgar it is very sexual however over the course of an entire record I find a lot of these skeletal beats a lot of these very quiet vocals a little underwhelming sort of makes the album boring as a whole project but at least it's interesting for a few songs and if you sort of wanted to catch up with peaches just sort of see what's going on with peaches as of late I guess pick up this record Kim Gordon's on a track that's cool I can appreciate that they wanted to do something new with this record and do something modern with this record however I think in the process of modernizing their sound they also embraced every new pop cliche that there is and invited on a series of almost unbearable vocal guests on a lot of these tracks not liking this know if you're a big grouper fan a big Liz Harris fan and you would like to hear those grouper styled vocals over some low fight we ish Slumberland style pop and rock then check this thing out other than that there's nothing really too novel or exciting about it last dinosaurs god I hope so III just feel like Slayer is completely out of ideas at this point III don't understand why they're not just the touring when they want to make more money I mean they're one of the greatest metal bands of all time they put out some of the most significant metal records ever hardcore metal fans are going to come out and see them play live whether they have a new record or not putting out a disappointing album in my opinion is not really the way to go I mean surely it plays closer to their roots than a lot of their sort of groove and new metal inspired albums that came out in the 2000s however this is some of the worst drumming I've heard on a slayer album in a long time it's not like they haven't recorded with paul bo staff before on drums the drumming is just so plain and so hideous the vocals are definitely raw and in-your-face I can appreciate that but the guitar riffs that that are on top of these drums just nothing really all that new or refreshing or anthemic or even memorable coming from Slayer on this record it's okay I think it just just barely barely meets the bare minimum criteria for what a listenable Slayer record should be if you want to get into some very atonal noise Rock I give this thing a listen I was pretty impressed with a lot of the initial singles to come out from this band a lot of which ended up on an EP that precedes this album over here but the record itself the full-length record itself a little underwhelmed by it not that excited by it it's definitely not structure very sharply it's definitely not melodic enough to be catchy but I don't think they're going for that they flirt with a lot of no wave isms on this record the bands that seem to very obviously influence this group a lot of which are on Rough Trade records are very savage very intense very noisy very extreme and I just feel like girl band doesn't push that envelope far enough if in fact that was what they were going for it's not your average rock album but it's not experimental enough to be out there or wild or exciting either this record is kind of like listening to a very small cute precious cartoon rodent sing some very sad sad songs over a series of instrumentals that have kind of an indie chronic flair I can't say I've ever cared for youth lagoons vocals or youth lagoons music before and I don't think this new sound where the singing and the instrumentation everything is just more up front brighter is changing my mind still don't really care for it probably one of the most uninspired albums I've heard this year all of the group's original charm and romance and songwriting ability right out the window listening to this I kind of feel like I'm being trolled and the demented dr. Seuss style cover art that does not help this is a side project of mr. Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys where he does not indulge in a lot of the blues rock that he does in the Black Keys but instead a lot of soul and psychedelic rock which coming out with this album shortly after the release of the last Black Keys album it makes sense because he was hinting towards those genres on that Black Keys record so now that he has this side project where he can kind of indulge in that it's not really that fantastic or exciting it doesn't really feel like this release that there was this just great creative energy that just needed to be put out there into the world and he had been holding it back because maybe the Black Keys just wasn't the appropriate project for it and now that he has this thing he can sort of in old Genet soul indulge in that psychedelic rock and pop instead of it being kind of this release of tension of this creative tension it just kind of sounds like a bit of a drab nostalgia it's okay ah it's okay that Bill Gates track was was hot though hey I did not see this coming a mixtape from jazz and a lot of the instrumentals on this thing are pretty good it's sort of like an interesting fusion between lo-fi somewhat analog hip-hop music and Chaz's usual musical style and there are some pretty cool vocal guests on here it does feel a little demo ish on some tracks and it does have that somewhat amateurish very loose feel of a mixtape however I think it would be really cool to hear some of these genres and some of these elements turn up on some of taurima's future projects I mean I like Chaz's pop music I like his approach to psych pop and dance music occasionally sometimes however hearing him diversify in the future and just try some new things on his commercial projects could be really cool I don't love it but it's definitely intriguing and it's awesome to see Chas continue to become more versatile over time Big Boi and Phantogram collaborating didn't sound that good to me on big boys last full-length album and hearing them string this weak watered-down southern hip hop indie tronic fusion that is super bland into a full-length EP doesn't entertain me either I mean I like a lot of big boys verses on this thing but the production is just doing nothing for me a lot of the time I don't see the hype I don't get the excitement I don't see what's so great about it I mean certainly Phantogram has fans Big Boi has fans they're great artists in their own right though I admit I am NOT a Phantogram fan but hearing them come together again it doesn't create sparks for me it's as exciting as hearing Linkin Park and jay-z collaborate and that is the why you know ravu thank you for watching you're the best dition have you given a listen to any of these records did you love them did you hate them why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana why you know review music forever 
kfglHY_7bUI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another vinyl update actually the final vinyl update the final vinyl update when it comes to the seven inches down here down here these seven inches down here that's what I'm talking about right there it's taken me four videos to go through my little shelf of 7 inches and singles 45s in my record collection over here it's been fun it's been fun y'all it's been real but we're we're to the end even if this video goes a little long we are going to just bust through the rest of these seven inches over here okay and yeah that's that's pretty much all there is to it from em to the end of the alphabet I forget how to pronounce this band's name well it doesn't even matter that that's the last 7-inch it might not even be in alphabetical order but what we have up up here first man I can't believe I have a single of this Eddy money take me home tonight did it it did essential 80s hit right here oh my god have you heard this song before if you haven't you should it's it's a nice little 80s pop rock tune and calm before the storm on the b-side on your remember what the b-side sounds like on this thing but that a side that a side that take me home tonight okay you can't say no to that offer you can oh oh boy oh boy I got another 80s hit over here I got mr. miss take these broken wings I got broken wings on on a 7-inch over here and on the b-side we have a uniform of youth oh boy oh man and the quintessential quintessential 80s hit over here it's the single on one side it's the instrumental on the other that's how fantastic of a track this was we just had to lay the instrumental on the other side Eddie Murphy party all the time my baby next to body out of death body of the tent body other time back when Eddie Murphy wishes he could be Michael Jackson he was seeing a lot of pop songs and man he really liked to rock that little off falsetto soprano that he had going and yeah that was probably one of his biggest pop hints although he had other singles he tried to drop around that time but yeah man party all the time Eddie Murphy if you want to have a good giggle Eddie Murphy's party all the time definitely check that track out all right here we have a little bit of a new wave since Punk art Punk's single this is actually one of the groups a name dropped in LCD Soundsystem's infamous losing my edge although it's not one of the more well-known groups that are dropped in that song we have the normal with the song TV out day today out a day and warm leatherette on the b-side if you haven't heard this single definitely look it up the normal TV OD not much to the packaging over here other than this little visual on the backside TB OD is a really really strange song definitely look up this track the normal TB OD you will have fun it will be fun I promise you I promise you here on Southern Lord Records really cool of them to pick them up for a single off of Southern Lord records we have a nice heavy 45 this is a heavy pressing over here this is like the heaviest 45 I've ever held this thing is heavy as hell we have off off of Southern Lord records with these songs compared to what and rotten apple and it's a 180-gram 45 and it's a deep blood-red record I love it definitely one of my favorite 45s not one of my favorite off songs but still a fantastic packaging over here they did not skimp Southern Lord always pulls through with some decent packaging so amen to them hallelujah to Southern Lord and also if y'all have watched my vinyl updates before you might already know what's coming up next but of course we don't just have this little off 45 over here that I am having a hell of a time getting back into the plastic it came with uh I was about to give up on life right there I was about to give up on life I was gonna quit like I was just gonna say okay it's done we have off first for EPS here in a box set in a nice box set which I picked up right away when I had the opportunity because this is definitely one of my favorite punk albums of the 2010s and it's got a cool little insert with uh you know a bit of a description of the band some some background some credits some of the art that I guess didn't make it onto the the Front's of these little EPS and a few a few lyrics over here not lyrics to all the songs but you know lyrics to at least some of these tracks and then we have the EPS themselves each of which come with a bold bit of very very very gritty contrast heavy art love that love that I do he's like a werewolf man and we got the guitar in the bloody foot and you know of course like the track listings on the backs of easy peas and you know the EPS are actually pretty thinly pressed black labeling I mean they're you know they sound great they're they're really grainy grimy really nasty hardcore punk  so I haven't really loved any of offs albums since the release of this it's at least cool to sort of see somebody I guess kind of you know keeping the keeping the dream alive as it were alright we are Oh Outer Limits recordings this is a bit of a we have to seven inches from Outer Limits recordings here which have appeared in previous vinyl videos and this is a bit of Lofa pop music songs I need my TV burning through the night Julie and plastic child Outer Limits recordings if you're in the mood for some loaf i home recorded pop music look into these seven inches and now i believe we have a few singles we actually have a couple singles wrapped up into a one sleeve from the pains of Being Pure at heart singles from their second full-length album two of the better singles we have heart in your heartbreak and we have say no to love with a lost st. on the b-side and then the one on the b-side of this 7-inch to 7-inch singles from the pains of Being Pure at heart off of Slumberland records ooh oh I forgot about this this is a nice magenta nice magenta 7-inch y'all had this one for a while yeah that's the heart in your heartbreak 7-inch with that nice magenta color although I'm not sure if this is a color the say no to love single is that a color oh it's like it's like a nice winter green that's nice or a nice Trident green that's beautiful nice pastel color there so there we go digging into the 7 inches coming up with a few impressive selections right from the 7-inch collection some sweet little noise pop singles well not really noise mop I mean they were noise pop with their previous record that's just really you know really some tweet and some pop rock right there but the pains being pure of heart look at them if you haven't seen them before we have Carl Perkins with blue suede shoes office son records look into son records if you don't know son records on the let's see the other side here we have Carl Perkins again with honey don't son records fantastic rock and roll in country records throughout the 50s a lot of great hits by the great classics a lot of the foundational songs of American music we have Pink Floyd another brick in the wall off of Columbia and one of my turns on the b-side a single that backed up the release of the wall and oh nice queen we are the champions we will rock you those two songs on the same 45 how can you say no actually the album these songs come from in my in my record collection over there oh here's a blast from the past this is a this is a 7-inch from a band that was local to me when I was in college and the band's name let me see I know that they okay Mike Mike Danielle bearded John hey I still got this copy of rip and offsides coming together on this oh that's offsides yes that's right there it is Christina Kyle max then nice nice so I bought this because the band that was local to me is rip and this is a bit of hardcore punk over here with some feminist leanings coming through on the lyrics and you know just like some really nasty hard-hitting stuff and then the band offsides on the on the B side both Connecticut hardcore bands and but but the group who I had I had sort of acquaintances and was rip and they had a they had songs on here such as I'm not unemployable I'm just young and in love and growing up not old and time's up great great job great track title right there and Battlefield Earth crisis whoa whoa and this came out on spicy soup records peligroso Boulevard Ella Grasso Boulevard in New Haven so that's a nice 7h split from off sides and rip there's a Connecticut has quite the hardcore history quite a few hardcore bands out of Connecticut this is one of my favorite singles I mentioned this single in my Lana Del Rey review because there was a really poor cover of this song on the end of Lana's new album we have sent a s my Dada with don't let me be misunderstood on the a side and on the B side we have your my everything and now we have a bit of screamo popping up from shizune hope I'm pronouncing that correctly I remember I gave this band a shout out for putting out one of my favorite EPS I believe one year and one of my best of lists and this one is a nice blue that's wonderful gotta love that no complaints about that but if you're a looking for some really hard-hitting screamo music give this band a look-see give this band a look-see especially this EP the CP solid was an ICP only if you left wrong we're almost there had to buy this this was one of my favorite singles of the year dropped 2013 and or at least one of my favorite EPS or something I mean I remember I reviewed it soap and skins sugar bread really twisted music on here if you're looking for some very dark I don't know just dark singer-songwriter music that's super heavy super dreary thick accent on it look into that and oh here's another Connecticut band who's seven-inch I bought the band is sorry excuse now if you go around Connecticut and you maybe hit up some record shows you could find one of these 7 inches except each one has a different drawing on it because all they did was print the top and the bottom and then they hand drew sometimes with crayon this cover and this one in particular seems to be done in pen and it's kind of like a dr. Seuss thing and it says say I like sorry excuse I do I like them sam-i-am says the band sorry excuse and this thing I believe is red yep it's red because I've played this 7-inch many many times after I got it it says it was supposed to be $2 on here although I might have paid more and it was on this record label in Connecticut that I think is defunct now vandal Children records nice kids from Connecticut and there are actually some songs on here that I remember sorry excuse was great sob story was fun date with destiny I thought was a little annoying Elvis come home was kind of weird and there's a great song here called touch butts which is a really fun little punk tune although my favorite track on this entire thing which I remember I have put this track on many a mix tape for many different people is this bands cover of this magic moment which was a really fun rough wild and rowdy punk cover of that song I mean it's just really this magic do this magic boba head and there's a little lyric sheet in here which is sweet oh yeah tick pots the touch but song is uh pretty funny but uh but yeah sorry excuse Connecticut punk act which I wish I knew where they are now because this was a fun little 7-inch that will most likely be in my collection forever not only because I enjoy it but because nobody else knows what the hell it is so you know alright so moving on I have a 7 inch 7 inch from sunset which I believe is a musical project of one singer/songwriter by the name of bill Baird and I bought this song for the ACE side which is titled I'm not a perfect person looks like I  up again which is a sad depressing little acoustic track about being a fuckup and it comes like completely useless person I guess I'm just very simple labeling black vinyl and on the b-side we have a song called love shines - which I don't recall instantly off the top of my head but I do remember I love this looks like I  up again single looks like we have a bit of super humanoids here the song is a crowded hour on the b-side and then there is Michaela on a side nice little a 7-inch single on white iris records I really liked although white iris didn't put out a lot of records that I liked I liked what they were doing with their 7 inches over here with these sleeves I thought this was really great colorful packaging that they were doing really great work on that I'm trying to remember this group's name hopefully I can see it sort of printed more clearly in here 10 moot mankind yes this should be in the T section this I believe was a little bit of hardcore punk and black metal mixed together on this 7-inch it's really epic artwork I mean the gold the silver and it's a really dark and that wolf on the front it's really good labeling on the 7-inch itself - I got to play this thing I feel like I put it at the end of my seven inches over here because I been meaning to play it but but i but i believe i heard a little bit of it and it was at like kind of some blackened hardcore punk i need to play this tam moot men kind I believe it's uh yes it's it's it's it's called or at least the the group is titled so I'm I'm gonna put this to the side I'm gonna try this give myself a refresher but I do remember this this seven-inch over here this is office Slumberland records it's from a band who I gave a very positive review to on one of their I try to remember the name of that I think it's a self-titled album Veronica Falls the single is bad feeling it's a nice little kind of a twee pop tune and on the b-side what do we have on the b-side try again the song try again very nice just kind of a bit of a brown black white greyish sort of uh color scheme here very cohesive liking that packaging and just very very simple 7-inch right there from Veronica Falls and Slumberland records and those are my seven inches this video in the previous few videos where I was kind of tripping through all of these records these 7-inch records hopefully I will uh I guess explore that side of the record spectrum a little bit more often and hopefully pick up some gems in the future because that's that's kind of a section a lot of people overlook occasionally I do need to get my together and do a little searching in that seven inch section fine to find some new good singles out there and uh yeah that's it I thank you guys so much for watching and just kind of chillin with me geeking out over a few records here and there and I hope you're well you're the best Anthony Fantana music 7-inches transition vinyl vinyl vinyl music forever 
KfSSnCZCIqk,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new game album documentary - the game is a west coast gangsta rapper who has been at it for years now broke through about ten years or so ago with his most successful album to date the documentary which this new album over here is the sequel to this isn't the first time I have reviewed his music I've been underwhelmed by a lot of his latest output to be completely honest so I was looking forward to this new release over here because I thought sort of doing a sequel album maybe a record with a bit more of a standard to it would sort of put a fire in games belly once again however I'm not reviewing this album by myself I'm gonna be doing a discussion type review of this record over here with fellow YouTube music reviewer Luke James there is a link to his YouTube channel down in the description below if you want to check out his stuff and we're just gonna go right into the review with little with a little shirt change as well transition hey everyone Anthony Fantana here again with the power of the internet with mr. Luke James how you doing dude good man how are you making it I'm good I'm good invited you on here talking with you through the magic of the Internet that's alright this new game record I kind of feel like we can't just simply go into our overall thoughts on the record because it is such a long record or in there and there's so much context to sort of take into scope with the album in general and also with the fact that this is a sequel record which there's there's kind of a lot of talk about these sorts of things in the hip-hop community when it comes to to sequel records I mean do you feel like there's a certain level of pressure that comes with with records like this do you generally feel excited when a record or are you very very hesitant definitely very hesitant as soon as I heard the game was gonna make the documentary too I thought to myself here we go again because just like with movies and music sequels don't always come up as good as the original I mean predator was a classic predator to no one talking about predator to but shout out to Danny Glover but as far as music goes blueprint a lot of people consider that to be a classic but the blueprint - on the other hand that takes a lot of heat and that was a double-disc just like this one mmm LP - that's another perfect example that's one that a lot of people are split on because in my opinion the first one that's one of my personal favorite albums but the second one I couldn't get down with that at all so a lot of time with these sequels I think a lot of people kind of go into them with lowered expectations I I agree I think I I think expectations are lowered but it's a certain kind of lowered expectations I mean I personally I like mmm LP - but I don't think it's anywhere near as great as the original obviously it simultaneously I feel like people go into these records not expecting them to be a bit to be better than the original but simultaneously it's kind of like these artists effectively hitting the reset button a little bit because it draws more attention to them if the then than if it were just any other game album because a lot of his output since like 2010 or so hasn't really garnered that much attention absolutely and this is 10 years after the first documentary so you know he can do the whole 10-year anniversary type of thing and I gotta agree with you his past couple of albums I wasn't too big on a lot of people feel differently about those I mean Jesus piece some people think that was one of his better albums I couldn't get into that I thought bloodmoon was just some of his worst work even though that's considered to be more of a compilation but you look at his first couple of albums I mean the documentary one a lot of people say it's a classic I mean that's arguable it depends on how you feel but the impact that head on the game when it dropped was crazy like if it brought the west coast back and you know just working with 50 all that dr. Dre production it was such a great album and even the doctors advocate that that was a good follow-up but then like you said it kind of fell off a bit you get these albums like the red album I don't even really remember too many songs off of that one but I know it wasn't that great I mean from the mid-to-late 2000s as far as like voices on the west coast going game was equally the essentially the biggest voice on the west coast and like you said I mean records like the documentary did bring the west coast back in a lot of ways so I kind of feel like I do want to make one more M&M comparison before we go into the record while I don't feel like a review spoiler that this is great as the documentary just like mmm LP - wasn't as great as mm LP one I do feel like game did go into this project with I don't know a bit more hunger than usual it's almost as if there was a standard that he was reminding himself that he had to live up to when writing a lot of these verses and delivering these rhymes on these songs I can agree with that because you can definitely hear it in his parish just the way that he flows I found he was very aggressive he was really coming at these tracks as hard as he possibly could he wasn't really bulging on these songs like a lot of artists do when they've been around for a long time especially one of the other things that worried me about this not only just the sequel thing was you look at the track listing and how long it is which you brought up at the start of this review and then all the features as well and there's so many features on here and then you listen to the album and a lot of them are very miniscule they don't bring a whole lot like you have Diddy just talking on the end of standing on Ferraris just like he did on one of Meek Mill songs on his last album I forget which one it was but he was just you know talking like did that it was actually the last track but at least he's one of the last tracks on the record yeah and even with some of the other features I know Dage loaf just does a little pirate on the end of step up I believe it was which I actually kind of liked that song just because as the 80s baby that beat took me back to the 90s because I've heard that beat before I can't place which song is from but I know I've heard that yeah then it was something as serious nostalgia going on in a few of the samples on this record I actually liked I actually think this record is pretty solid from like the first two the intro track of like the fifth track and everything everything is pretty solid for me I mean I could have done without the the Diddy monologue at the end and standoff Ferraris but I'll make the record for the first five tracks is super solid and the instrumentals on this thing are killer even on a lot of the tracks that I don't like he did get a lot of good production on here but I feel like there were a couple songs that didn't really vibe with me I didn't like that la song and all that to me just kind of seemed like more of a radio mainstream grab and I've actually heard that same sample flipped on an exhibit song I think it's called Family Values and it's flipped much better than that song that was probably my least favorite song on here actually I've actually that's this one of several samples on this thing that I've heard in other places you know including those really devilish horns from that song that screamin Jay Hawkins song I put a spell on you um you know there's actually some really obvious sampling going on throughout a lot of these tracks but I guess I didn't really mind it too much I mean the only thing that really bugs me about a lot of these tracks musically and song wise is that we get a bit of a throwback to ìshe R&B hooks that you normally would have heard on a lot of rap albums in the 2000s which I guess the album overall I mean a lot of stuff on here feels like a throwback from 10 years ago not only those styles of hooks but also the fact that we do have such a long with overloaded very feature centric album that sounds like it was a huge budget going into this thing which i think is also proven and the fact that we're getting another disc of this record just a little while after the release of this thing I mean it certainly sounds like and you also look at the producer list on here I mean will.i.am appears a number of times as well as Boy Wonder does it be on here and there's a really great DJ Premier instrumental in the tracklist here I actually didn't mind la too much I actually liked the track a little bit I felt like the the last handful of songs and the first handful of songs are where this album is really at its best and I feel like game is a toward the back end of this record and playing toward a lot of that nostalgia and trying to bring back that old-school West Coast sound and you know kind of getting back to I guess the roots of the type of lyricism in the type of music I he grew up on especially after actually summertime yeah I really like summertime a lot actually that was one of my favorite tracks on here and I was surprised that that was a Mike will made of production like that sounds nothing like the beats that he normally makes cuz he's known for making those bangers working with rae sremmurd so when I hear his when I heard his cue at the start the ear drummers and then that mellow beat came in I was like what what is this this sounds like some Jake one production nothing like he would make but I really liked that song a lot cuz of the vibe and I wanted to come back to what you said about the old iron B hooks that's one thing that stuck out to me on the song step up I was actually listening to that and my wife was sitting right here and she goes are you listening to brandy because there's one pirate in the hook where the melody comes from Brandy's song I think at one get was I want to be down come on you know this isn't Randy but you know I picked up on that once you said it and like you said before about how there's so many songs on here I found that was the biggest weakness here I found some of these tracks kind of bordered on filler the Scott Storch produced one bitches ain't shit was just you're kind of typical you know chauvinistic type of track but I also thought that was a bit of a missed opportunity if he could have got like two short on there or Devin the Dude to me that song was screaming for a Devin the Dude verse maybe even a hook because that's exactly the type of thing that he does know I agree and I think I think sort of what he does with that track topically I feel like it's almost redundant at that point after he did the song circles where you know he had that whole I guess a bit of a fight you know with his girl that a bunch of random bullshit you know it's it's just a moment the album gets super dramatic I mean I agree with you with the album being kind of overly long and there are tracks on here that are most definitely songs that I would categorize as filler I kind of feel like if if the whole middle portion of the album just does appeared we'd have a fantastic beginning and a fantastic end and it would meet somewhere in the middle although I feel like even though there are a lot of tracks that I don't like it all at the middle point of here of this record including circles I mean I don't really care for that track I think the acting that I guess you could call it in the middle of the track between him and the the female singer that he has on the songs god-awful the uncle sketch I thought was kind of a hard to sit through as well as the track with future who I thought was maybe the most out of place guests that he had on the whole record I feel like if the whole middle portion of this record just disappeared the this project would have been so much better there was also that one cut with what was the name of the track with jellyroll noxious Li shouting throughout the entire song and I just threw off the track entirely like just one more moment on here where we're a feature just ruins a song I mean I kind of feel like you know wasn't there any point once the album was sequenced that when you were listening through the record didn't anyone realize that the middle portion of this album sounds entirely different from everything else on it and it's just not as good yeah that hashtag song was that was my least favorite by fire he kind of sounded like a broke-ass little John to me just the way that he was screaming yeah and on that same song wasn't there like he's like rapping and there's a weird story on there about how he's getting head and his mom walks in and he and he's watching The Goonies yes and that was the other thing like like I listened back to the first a few times and I was like is he getting head to the Goonies like it just kind of felt like he was talking about watching Goonies and then all of a sudden he's getting head I don't know if it was happening during the Goonies viewing session or if he had just fast forwarded a little bit well those two things I mean they kind of go they go together a little bit I'm not gonna hate all the guns yeah I mean sloths in the background might be a little bit weird but no still a classic oh my god yeah and and and that's kind of one of many lyrical moments on the record that that he just really lost me I mean I can enjoy a lot of games older stuff because even though it may not be really conscious or super lyrical there's a certain kind of unapologetic meanness and bluntness to it that I think is really entertaining and really badass and just really you know in your face and and nasty and that's the kind of fire that I don't think he's had since like ten years ago and it's kind of cool to see it make a bit of a comeback on this record but still the lyrics do become a bit of an Achilles heel on this album I mean I think one of the most glaringly bad lines on the entire record is Wenham I think it's on that made-in-america track when he says I wanted to be easy but then I realized it wouldn't be easy yeah he says I wanted to be Tupac but then that might get you shot I was like fuck what yeah he definitely reached I mean I can't disagree with what he's saying but he just puts it in the most I don't know no I I feel you 100% he definitely had some barriers on there that I didn't know what he was thinking there was on another song where he said something about how he was hitting some girl under the bleachers while she was on a rag and he goes on blood and I was like oh I get it cuz blood and blood oh nice one that was the classic game right yeah but he he did come hard on some of these tracks like I think he killed it on the song with Kendrick I bought that last verse he had I thought he went off but it was kind of weird in that first part when he was doing the acapella and he did that thing that game does that a lot of people get annoyed with where he sort of mimics people where he kind of does the same thing as the person who's on the track with him for example on Blood Moon on black-on-black that had Jeezy and Kevin gates who both you know sound like they need some sucrets so what does the game do he kind of put some of that on his voice and does the same thing and on this song with Kendrick he kind of had that high-pitched tuned up thing happening on his voice did you notice that on that last verse that was right that was the moment right after Kendrick first right yeah yeah that was that was a soon his kendrick was done rapping and kind of doing his little singing spot it was he says we need acapella Kendrick says and then he starts yeah he kicked off the track Kendrick comes in and then when the game reintroduces himself it was kind of weird because I was like wait who am i listening to who's popping up on the track now because he had kind of changed up his is delivery so much at that point the song and he does that on a lot of songs I call him the shang tsung as rap cuz he just gets on the tracks and just sucks the soul at whoever's there and does their same style he's been known to do this although I thought he did I thought he did a decent job and I think I'm gonna start you know maybe centering a little bit more around some of my favorite moments from the UH from the record past the first five tracks I thought he held his own and did well and stuck to a concept on the song 100 with Drake which I liked a lot I thought Drake came through really well on that song and I thought you know the this idea of just being true to yourself and truthfulness was really great I loved the title track to this thing I thought the flow that he did on that title track was one of the best flows on the entire record and and and I already referenced it but I thought the kind of laid-back and nostalgic and really sentimental tone that he took on summertime was really great too yeah the title track was definitely a standout that primo production was just classic again that classic 90s sort of sound that he had on there and he sounded hungry on that one that was another one where I thought he was spitting some of his best material but one of the songs I didn't like I know we're trying to get into the ones we do like but there's just these weird moments throughout this album and it was mula Kanye West on moolah I'm sorry like I I'm trying to be excited for Kanye's next album but his little features here and there they haven't been doing it for me I liked him on Smuckers on that Tyler the Creator album I thought that sounded kind of like the old braggy Kanye that we like but then he was on that ASAP Rocky song I wasn't really a fan of what he did on there and then he gets on this and he's doing that singsong II type of flow and that Kanye just what are we gonna get from Kanye I wouldn't even call it sing a song as much as just kind of him howling and moaning yeah you know which he did a little bit on the Travis Scott thing too although he was like extreme enough to the point where he did kind of jump off the track you know he really popped out of the mix and it was it was at least entertaining for a little bit but but I I hear ya I don't really like moolah either I mean of course there were some tracks that outside the middle point of the record I didn't really love but for the most part of those songs just kind of underwhelmed me a little bit just kind of like like that Mulan track like just just another day as well which I didn't love but I didn't think was fantastic either yeah there were a lot of middle-of-the-road tracks for me on this record as well I think there were a lot of cuts that um just didn't do what I thought this album did best and that was game kind of going back sticking to his roots playing to his strengths and instead when he varies from that I feel like it's only to do something kind of trendy and that's when he you know is inviting Kanye on that's when he's bringing future on I think the one moment where he does something trendy on here but it goes over well as 100 but outside of that I don't really care for a lot of these variations from a lot of this old school and a lot of this West Coast style production that he does on this record I think a lot of it just kind of ends up I'm know showing his age a little bit not that I think he's too old to be rapping but he just kind of sound a little outside of his element I guess he definitely gets a little bit all over the place on this album but that's kind of has to be expected when you have an album that's this long I mean 19 tracks backing tracks and that's like without bonus cuts and sometimes I feel kind of bad when I when I'm reviewing albums are talking about albums and I'm complaining about the length cuz in a way the artist is just giving you more music you know I don't want to hate on them for giving more music to their fans but at the same time when you're looking at how an entire project sounds I would rather a couple tracks be shaved off and you give me something great then a bunch of filler that I'm just skipping through and you know some songs have great moments on them I'm coming back to circles I really like that little cute feature it's not cute hips best verse by any means but that beep switched up where it had that really nice vibe to it and q-tip did his little thing that was great but the rest of the song with the you know Tyler Perry acting going on throughout that was unnecessary yeah I mean honestly in the abstract I don't really care that something is nineteen tracks as long as all 19 tracks are great oh absolutely absolutely cuts on here that you just don't want to be there because they're not really that good however I feel that game and his producers wanted the record to flow is this cohesive thing because a lot of these songs on here especially toward the beginning and toward the end flow into one another like the beginning of one instrumental has a bit of the last instrumental in it or you know one track overtly references the other in some kind of way so you know I could tell that they wanted to put together something a little ambitious something that came together into a I don't know a bit of a story or a picture or something you know not not many tracks on this thing's stand out is just like you know standalone single type songs I mean as much as I like that Kendrick track for example you know it doesn't like have a banger chorus or anything like that and uh quite a few choruses on this thing like I said you know kind of have this softer or just kind of old-school R&B style some hook which these kinds of courses I mean are long dated at this point well you know I hear these kinds of courses on the radio anymore I mean game is obviously indulging in this kind of his stuff you know for his for his own tastes and just kind of his own artistic style yeah he definitely lost his way a bit on this album but I think it's for the most part there's a lot of good songs on here but not a lot of incredible ones there's not a lot of songs here that when I'm driving around I'm really coming back to I did like 100 even though I found Drake's voice verse just to be overly drakey you know how he's saying like little to drinky if I wasn't successful I'd have more friends probably and just all that type of stuff but you know again you kind of expect that type of thing from Drake and it did work on the track to give it a nice summertime wavy type of vibe and I got a shout out the production from was it Johnny Giuliano I think that did that he used to work with Wiz Khalifa a lot I think he did the beat on that and so he did a great job on that and most of the producers did I mean game he said before this album came out that he was going to be working with a lot of big name producers and some of the people that he worked with on a first documentary like Scott Storch who he brought on this one as well so the production definitely had a strong points but I think he could have done more with his rapping he does have some clever lines here and there and I like his overall sound his vocals and his delivery and his gruffness but there weren't a lot of lyrics that really stuck out to me and had me rewinding or you know wanting to put in game as a talk to your lyricist yeah I mean a lot of my favorite lyrics and verses actually come from some of the guests on here I mean I thought ice cubes feature and dr. Dre's feature were fantastic I thought have soules feature wasn't too bad either of course Kendricks was great you know but but again I kind of went into this thing expecting gain not to really wow me lyrically all that often really just kind of impressed me more with just his brutishness which is typically what he brings to a track so would you say you're satisfied with what he brought on here as far as that goes as far as bringing the aggression or just a Senate race and his aggression and his personality yeah I mean overall I think I'm satisfied with the record I think I'm pretty satisfied with the record on the instrumental thing on the instrumental side of things as well however where I get kind of torn is that I think some of the hook sound dated I think some of the songs are awful and I think some of the features actually ruins some of these songs you know and then some of the songs I mean they aren't really awful as much as they are just really under written like like that hashtag track for example which just kind of fades out out of nowhere with just more Jelly Roll screams the track with Kanye West feels kind of under written too there are some tracks on here that just don't feel as well crafted as some of the best songs on this record and it's really obvious and I don't know why they made it onto the track listing well I think is you know kind of one of the things that games should have observed in the modern era of rap records you know I kind of feel like you don't have these lengthy rap albums anymore because people can put these kind of throwaway filler tracks that have bigger names on them and they're just putting them out there so that they can get more notoriety as as deluxe and bonus tracks and I feel like if we took maybe five or six of these songs and turned them into deluxe and bonus tracks and threw them on the back end we would have had a way tighter way more entertaining project and you still got another disc coming so think about that like what is this whole project gonna sound like together as a double disc so that I think his approach here was pretty interesting to release this first disc and sell that to the people and then sell the second one so it was a smart move even after being somewhat indifferent on this first project here I can't really say I'm I'm gonna just completely ignore the second disc because looking at the feature list looking at the producer list on that disc it seems as if he's put in just him out of that just about as much effort on the next disc to again just from that feature and producer standpoint the the second disc here doesn't really look like a slouch either what stood out to you that you saw on the second disc as far as producers because I saw a DJ Quik on there and I'm a huge DJ Quik fan so when I saw he was on there and he has a quick screw v' like anyone who knows quick knows he always puts a quick groove on his album so to get one of those from DJ Quik I mean that's that's a blessing right there um you know him and I just uh you know will.i.am as well who I thought pulled together some of the best instrumentals on this record and I also was looking forward to the schoolboy q feature I mean who I think out of everybody in Topp Dogg he puts together some of the best features so it'll be interesting to kind of hear him appear on a this second disc on here I mean he really should have just got Jay rock on as well and she's got the whole black hippy collective on on these two discs I believe if he's on the second disc is Lily okay well then I think I might have seen him on there he got the whole gang together yeah he definitely knows who to reach out to for this album like you said he's kind of going with the trends and picking who's popular but he does a pretty good job for the most part of incorporating people I mean some of these features are misses but every now and then he gets it right and makes these good songs like 100 that one came through but I think some of these songs were unnecessary with the features like did you really need Dage loaf on the end of that song I forget what she just kind of did a outro chorus thing that didn't really add much to the song I don't know how necessary that was and again we can come back to jelly roll who at first when I saw jelly roll was on here I'm like is that the fat white rapper from Tennessee are you familiar with him you ever see him he works with like little white and three 6 mafia and those guys I'm like why the hell is he on here but this is jelly roll from I know he's worked with exhibit before and some other West Coast guys producer and singer so he came through on there but I'm looking forward to the second disc I want to hear what is gonna sound like together the whole thing yeah I mean and maybe between now and then some of these tracks the middle this project will grow on me or you maybe I think the growing is done for me I've had this one in rotation for a little bit and you know a lot of those ones in the middle it's not even that they're trash like a lot of these songs I don't think they're all out awful they're just not overly interesting there's a rehash of content that I've heard before they don't bring a whole lot like just another day that was one that was a pretty good song but it's not one I'm gonna keep coming back to and at first I thought that was gonna be his track from off of Compton remember you had the song on Compton yes just another day I thought it was gonna be that one at first but then it was completely different one and he had the line about hanging the that shooter with the Confederate flag that was that line stuck out to me a little bit cuz he didn't make an effort here and there to say some socially conscious stuff not not a whole lot I mean between the girl on her egg under the bleachers and goonies blowjob there's a little bit of stuff there that he's trying to say yeah I'm tracks like that and also on New York New York you know he certainly was making the effort to I guess sort of you know pulled together some sentimental moments and some personal moments that was the one with you right yeah I mean you know the the moments where it does feel like he's addressing something socially not that it's a bad thing you know you get the sense more that he's not trying to make a political statement he's only sort of talking about it because he feels some kind of way about it personally you know which is good because it leads to those moments going over well it makes them it keeps them from being preachy or as if like he's just kind of commenting on something that you're just a comment on it you know yeah I was actually interested when I saw the tracklist for this and I saw there was a song called New York New York because of course there's that dogpound song from back in the 90s New York New York the famous video where they're stomping down all the buildings so I didn't know what I thought you might be going for some sort of weird creative approach there but he didn't really take it that route no I wasn't it just it just kind of felt like to me you know I thought that there that it might be some kind of disoriented beef back up again or something I don't know a couple times on here he didn't really say anything too hard what was it he said no 50 cent documentary to keep the change sure something like that everybody makes mistakes he didn't like that line did you I see you laughing you didn't like that one did you that moment on the record it's it's just I guess what I kind of find funny is that I think you know outside of some of these more emotional moments you know ten years on from the documentary it seems like game isn't really sort of you know saying anything much different than what he typically says you know and and and that's another thing I think we should probably say about this thing before we uh before we head out on this review you know going into this record you can expect you know games typical sort of gangster talk a lot of mention of bloods and Compton and you know like a lot of descriptions of places local to him you know your typical I guess game lyrics however you know even though he is kind of blunt with a lot of what he says occasionally he's poetic and I I think you should probably go into this thing expecting to you know laughs as some of what he's saying but not really laugh at him kind of laugh at just you know how much of a I guess a badass he builds himself up to me yeah yeah he does have his moments on here and now he's got the beef with stitches going on so I'm sure that's nothing yeah he's mostly ignore that dude which he should you should just can be a dude yeah stitches I don't think is gonna be a big up-and-comer I don't think that's gonna last but yeah it has it hasn't even lasted yeah that he had those couple songs where people were just gawking at him because he's crazy yeah and I think games just gonna continue to ignore him because he's just he's just a thirsty dude absolutely and I think one more thing to add on this review that you got to expect from game is the name dropping because he is name dropping every song it's just I mean that's that's just what he does he loves to drop names he even got at Lupe said Lupe was a weirdo - which Lupe responded by posting creep the song creep by Radiohead so you know I don't think he's really taking stiff jabs at these people just like you said he's kind of doing what the game always does just throwing these little shots here and there yeah alright I mean like I said I'm somewhat indifferent toward this as a total package but there are a lot of songs on here that I thought were really good and even though you know I kind of went into the same thing not assuming it would be as good as the documentary and it's just kind of your typical case of hip-hop sequel itis in a lot of ways I did feel like he went into this thing with a little bit more ambition and hunger than he typically does and I admire it for that and I think a lot of songs on this thing came through as good as a result of that but still you know the moments when he tries to do something trendy and tries to do something you know a little or you know invites some people on who actually are detriment to these songs he actually ends up making this album worse than it needed to be which is not really a risk that you want to take on such a long record to begin with you're already kind of testing people's patience a little bit with 19 tracks you're gonna want to make sure that those 19 tracks are your sharpest and tracks if you're gonna put out that many and you have a second disc on the way I'm feeling a like decent six on this thing I'm gonna go with a 3.5 out of 5 on this I really did like a lot of the production on here I think like you said game was bringing more energy than he did on his last projects and when you compare this to that blood moon like this this is just so much better than that like volumes way way way better and I actually like this better than Jesus peace I like it better than the red album so I think this is one of his better albums at least in recent years so 3.5 out of 5 fits for me and I'm curious to see what the second disc is gonna sound like alright and you know you and I can have a bit of a discussion when that comes out - absolutely thank you have same--in thumbs up come again thanks for having me yeah thanks for coming on I think we're going to leave it at that I will leave a link down there in the description box where you can check out of Luke's YouTube channel and see many of his reviews on various hip hop albums that have just dropped and again we're probably gonna have another discussion once this second disc of the documentary comes out so I'll talk to you again soon dude see you man bye forever 
TdwoYwB_0hk,[Music] hi everyone sore theny throat tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Loma Prieta record self-portrait hey I have something really cool to show you come on over here right there look at him hey with alligator friend don't bite my finger oh I think I'm going crazy Loma Prieta is a San Francisco scream oh and post-hardcore band whoo I stumbled upon back in 2012 with their full-length album I V one of my favorite albums of that year not only a fantastic scream oh and hardcore punk record but also one of the most cacophonous abrasive and unforgiving rock albums of that year it was absolutely destructive and I was wondering if on this new album over here they would serve up what was essentially another whirlwind of horror however I was noticing that the teaser tracks leading up to the release of this album were not as abrasive a little more melodic seemed like some of the instrumentation and the mix in the recording was certainly clearer and overall this new album over here is not nearly as relentless and as unforgiving as loma prieta x' previous work there's actually quite a bit of balance between the cleaner sounds in the mix here and the more distorted sounds a lot of the bass and the drums have quite a bit of resonance while the guitars and the vocals especially the vocals are very fuzzed out they're very distorted they're very rough and there are actually some more melodic passages worked into these songs through the guitars and through the vocals more than I think anyone who enjoyed Loma Prieta as last album would have expected which is kind of a tune I feel like I've been singing a lot lately with the new deafheaven album with the new black breath album however I don't feel like these more melodic passages actually weaken this new album in any way the more melodic bits of these songs actually don't take away from the intensity and the potency of loma prieta x' energy there are tons of throttling melodic punk in mentals all over this record I think the opener is is slightly drab with it's kind of tedious very dreary melodies but I love the song black square where the band transitions one time after another from these dissonant guitar chords to these descending spiraling riffs that are slathered and distortion there's just a ton of momentum behind this track it's pretty overpowering and seems kind of converge inspired or with the track roadside cross I love the harmonious guitar passages that the band busts into on a few occasions on this track Loma Prieta has become just noticeably sweeter on this project give a listen to the closing track on this thing where you're actually getting some shouted kind of bright vocal harmonies a sort of warm moment on the album just before a lot like on the band's last album this song sort of descends into this wall of distortion that just smothers the entire mix and kind of closes the track out so even though the mix on this record is cleaner noise still plays a pretty integral role in Loma Prieta sound and even though I like the vocal arm and he's I like the melodies on this closing track I think this song could have been better and and some of the other tracks on here too I guess it's because I wish the vocals were louder I wish they were cleaner I get that noise is an important part of this Bands formula but I feel like the vocals are just too obscured to really connect with them in any significant way the vocals often are so quiet they're overpowered by the guitars they're barely even readable which I guess wasn't really an issue when everything in the mix was slathered in some kind of distortion but now the vocals just kind of feel a little out of place against these very resonant drums bass and guitars and these vocals feeling so out of place I think takes away from the impact of some of the best tunes on this record like the song more perfect where there's a really great vocal line and even on tracks where the vocals feel like they have slightly more presence like on the song nostalgia it's almost as if I'm hearing some kind of wall between me and the vocals that just isn't there with the other instruments these distortion effects and this very quiet mixing on the vocals actually just impact them to the point where on the song never remember ironically they make the vocals way less memorable however when I listen in very closely to a lot of the melodic ideas that the vocals are bringing forward they're actually not that bad and again I like a lot of the instrumentals on this record actually I think they're great I think the performances throughout this album are electrifying and just very high intensity the production when not looking at the vocals just observing the bass and the guitars and all that is great I think the songs are certainly there on this record and song structure wise Loma Prieta I think are coming together with some of their most ambitious tracks yet however it's just that vocal mix that I think kills a lot of these songs just the vocals having no presence whatsoever because they're so distorted they're so quiet throughout much of these tracks and I think in the midst of transitioning to a new sound Loma Prieta has lost maybe just a smidge of identity however with some bolder louder more tangible vocals maybe that could be fixed maybe that can be changed I am liking this album quite a bit though despite my one major issue with one single aspect of it really I'm feeling a light 7 on this thing transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Loma Prieta forever 
euPwooYyB-I,hi hi hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's froggy is music nerd and it's time for review of the new disclosure album kara disclosure is an electronic music duo hailing from the UK who broke through a few years ago with their highly celebrated debut album settle it was a record I enjoyed quite a bit it featured a lot of very sharp house music productions on it as well as some very well-received vocal guests people like Sam Smith as well as alunageorge however some of my favorite tracks on this record didn't feature any vocal guests tracks like f4u and when a fire starts to burn yes the music and the album did sound like the the perfect soundtrack to some kind of Hawaii toidy high-end retail clothing shop and it most certainly was that but I thought disclosure had a kind of artful approach to house music and dance tunes with a kind of old-school Flair complemented with some modern production and just more contemporary music sensibilities I have no reason not to go into this latest LP over here without assuming that we were going to get another set of very sleek smooth classy bangers however one thing I did notice going into this new disclosure album is that it seemed like a lot of the vocal guests were centering more around what was topping the charts in the US and that there were some more high profile names people like the weakened and Miguel and of course Lord and Sam Smith hops on this new disclosure album as well and there were some other singers and faces on this thing that were at least new to me that was pretty excited to hear as well and it's a pretty diverse array of guests on this thing coming from the worlds of alternative R&B and pop music and soul and jazz even which is nice because it keeps the LP from going stale because a lot of the production on here while I do like it it is somewhat Sammy Sammy from track to track with a lot of the driving for to the floor kick drums the offbeat snares and hi-hats as well as the very gummy baselines it may be a really obvious formula but disclosure are far from your average EDM DJ's I mean I'd rather listen to this then like Avicii or Zedd however though I think on this new record over here disclosure leans a little too hard on their guest stars sort of hoping that they would guess kind of carry the record here when in fact they don't really because a lot of the biggest vocal features on this record are so the most underwhelming unfortunately as disclosure just sort of tries to fit one guest after another into these old-school house music vocal lines regardless of whether or not it actually fits the respective style of the singer and some of the vocal performances here are just a little underwhelming like Miguel's who he just sounds absolutely anonymous on this track it would not have guessed it was Miguel if you hadn't told me songs on this record like jaded and echoes songs that I like quite a bit that don't have a celeb vocal credit put on the tracklisting tracks like these have way bolder singing in my opinion but another example for me on this thing of trying to fit a round peg into a square hole is when lord is trying to take on this old school how sound I feel like her breathy kind of dramatic vocals don't really fit too well into this vocal style the weaken certainly comes close with the opening track here nocturnal the the verses are a little middle-of-the-road for me but once the chorus pops in it's just sparks with the multi-layered vocals and the weekend reaching into his upper range able not to noona Sam Smith's multi-layered vocals on his track actually do get a little muddy though which I don't care for too much but the tune that he's on is good but I think the first fire vocal appearance on this thing actually comes from jazz singer Gregory Porter he sounds amazing on this track not only does he have a fantastic vocal presence he's very bold his voice is very husky it's very expressive he has a great melody to sing but also he's like he has a very intimate familiarity with this kind of music with this old-school house music that Disclosure borrows from so obviously definitely more of an intimate relationship than some of the artists on this record do then I feel like disclosure and their guests start making impressions on this album on me but for the wrong reasons kind of like on the track willing and able which is not only a really lackluster and redundant tune but quads vocal appearance on this track is is really a I just couldn't stand it honestly he's not really that articulate of a singer and I found a lot of his a I guess kind of a pronunciations and Cadence's in his singing to be kind of a sloppy and all over the place and the track super go featured some baby voice singing kind of like in the vein of alunageorge but again I just feel like the tone of this voice was really getting to me and it was almost as if the song was teasing me when it went to this chorus singing you don't like it you don't like it yet I don't I yeah I don't I enjoy the closing track on this thing a lot though it shows Disclosure varying away from the house formula and doing a bit of I guess synthetic R&B and soul with a very just bouncy very fat bassline although I wish they kind of changed up the drum Tambor's a little bit because the very I guess jutting electronic kick drums I don't think complement this kind of music all that well still I do like the song though and I think disclosure did do a good job of kind of changing things up stylistically and made a very sensual closing track in the process overall I thought this LP was okay I mean it's not as fantastic as settle I don't think but it's not really the the grave disappointment some people have painted this album to be I think it has a lot of positive characteristics it's just that a lot of them can also be found on settle I don't really feel like the duo has progressed or grown in any significant way on this new record over here which I think was kind of necessary if the duo was going to continue on the streak set by the first album it's just kind of a slightly more watered down more commercial and star-studded version of settle I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing transition have you given this record to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fanta no disclosure forever 
Db-XqhdOaE8,hi everyone not the meet a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new waves record V there you are where you been yeah here just here what you've been doing nothin that's what I like to hear waves is the pseudonym or I guess the the band fronted by mr. Nathaniel Williams a guitarist singer songwriter from California he came up in the midst of the blogosphere is obsession with loaf I music in the late 2000s breaking out with the album wave diseases and Nathan was really quick and very smart not to continue to capitalize on this trend because it was it was on its way out the door and with his next full-length album king of the beach an album I liked a lot more than waves 'as he had a studio recording a lip-smacking hard-hitting punky loud punchy clear studio recording and not only did he gravitate away from that loaf i thing he also incorporated more elements of punk music and power pop in a bit of surf music too and some lyrics that kind of painted him as this very lazy kind of funny nihilistic stoner slacker dude and ever since the release of this album he's been more of a studio recording artist and he has been a low five artist although on his next full-length album which I didn't really care for he and his band tried to I guess revive all of these 90s and Nirvana isms and grunge isms which didn't really play out that well so going into this new record over here I was kind of hoping for less 90s worship especially since nostalgia and just recreating this kind of music is so easily within reach for so many other less talented bands to my ears nathan has already established waves with a really rough around the edges fun pop punk sound why not continue to just fan those flames and that's essentially what happens this new record over here titled v4 waives fifth album although it is Nathan's first for Warner Brothers Records where this thing is being released real Punk real Punk on Warner Brothers ah another thing that was kind of confusing up to the release of this album was how Nathan was rebellious Lee releasing songs to his album saying I don't care a Warner Brothers things I'm releasing songs on this album anyway ah for sure it's faster and it feels louder and more hard-hitting and punky er than the last waves album but I just think the lyrics and the songwriting is a little out to lunch on this thing because there are some moments on this album that are just downright annoying though I don't totally fault the performance here I mean the bass the drums the guitars the vocals they're all really tight super tight suspiciously tight to the point where I don't really feel like I'm listening to a loose wild kind of Punk recording the only thing on this mix that feels kind of blemished are the guitars which have a very tattered rough distorted tone to them and Nathan's vocals which I guess are a little unkempt and slovenly not really in kind of this wild rebellious sort of way but more in like a lazy I don't yeah a kind of way which I guess now that I think about it kind of feels like a bit of a disconnect with the music I mean the music that we're hearing here is actually again very tight very precise not a single sound or anything out of place whereas Nathan on top of all this music just sounds really strung out and almost as if he just has no real purpose and I can't help but think of some other rock records that have turned up earlier this year sort of like that new deysa paris Eidos record this new album over here is is similarly over compressed to the point where the drums and the bass and the guitar is just all melt together in this really hideous just really unappealing way and another thing that this album sort of is sharing with that day so paris Eidos album is that for something so loud it's so not exciting it's like listening to a revolution against nothing which this album has that in common with the new fiddler album - and vie kind of showcases a similar attitude and life philosophy as well like this whole woe is me life sucks kind of world view which not that Nathan hasn't had that before I mean it was there on king of the beach but at least in that context there were some catchy songs to go along with it and Nathan's vocals did sound a little Wilder a little more I guess out of control on here though it's as if Nathan is selling that slacker attitude to the point where it's actually affecting the quality of his vocal performances like he's just so above caring about anything that we have some songs on the back end of this record like cry-baby which are really excruciating to listen to this record is just really doing nothing for me and just gets so old for me so fast which is bad because it's such a short album it's not even that long of an album it doesn't even take this album that long just great on my nerves and one single song here and there listening to the singles leading up to this thing it wasn't too bad I thought that they might all come together into something a bit more exciting but rather what I got here was just a bit of a I guess a musical purgatory that I just got more and more frustrated with my surroundings as I sat and stayed in this place almost as if I had claustrophobia and the just overly loud and compressed instrumentation and Nathan's really obnoxious vocal delivery combined with the fact that you didn't really save much of anything interesting lyrically on this record and the songs are just weak track after track after track after track the this was just really a slog I'm feeling a strong four on this thing transition have you given this record to listen if you have did you loved it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Antoine Phan Tuan here waves vie forever 
hDBXZOCsZKI,Sunday's Sunday Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Kurt Vile record believe I'm going down Kurt Vile is a philadelphia singer-songwriter and he's been at it for well over ten years now as far as releasing music under his own name goes he sort of grabbed a lot of blog buzz in late 2000s with his kind of loaf I mix of folk rock and psychedelic rock and Americana music fans and music writers alike were enamored with his sound especially when he came through with his breakout records a smoke ring for my halo on Matador Records I didn't really care for it personally but even I was impressed with his follow up wakin on a pretty dais a record that to me featured slightly better lyrics some prettier more psychedelic layers of instrumentation and this is definitely Kurt's most ambitious LP yet with some of his longest songs landing on here he still had this kind of lazy rambling demeanor to his vocal delivery but these songs definitely felt more lively they felt more engaging and I was excited to go into this new LP over here hoping that he would continue on this streak of creating intoxicating but also slightly electrifying fault rock music and one thing that had me even more excited going into this album is that some of the songs leading up to this thing were really dry not as soaked in reverb in various layers of instrumentation just kind of drowning Kurt out a little bit Kurt felt really up front and center vocally and I thought it was going to be exciting to hear Kurt kind of play it less trippy on a record and that's exactly what he does on this new album over here the instrumentation on this record is loaded with pianos and keys and some acoustic guitars there's a little banjo on one track of course drums vocals and there are just some very light touches here and there of echo and reverb it's nowhere near as dreamy as his past two records but curse still plays a pretty low key on his vocals even though he doesn't really give himself anywhere to hide in the mix a bunch of reverb and layered guitars he's still very hey dude even on the opening track here pretty pimpin which is easily one of the most upbeat tracks on this entire record it's this surreal introspective song about Kurt not seeing who he is or not realizing that he is him when he looks in the mirror and he thinks the guy in the mirror is some kind of stupid clown and I like the song I'm an outlaw to which I'm not sure if the drums in the background here are live drums or if they're loop drums there's just something about the percussion here that feels slightly electronic which is cool because that's sort of an aspect I liked about Kurt's last album this fusion of these very repetitive hypnotic somewhat synthetic beats along with this very psychedelic folk instrumentation so again I like these songs there - the most upbeat tracks here but once the energy level on this thing drops on this record and it doesn't even need to drop that low because even these two tracks are pretty low-key and very easygoing when Kurt gets even more subtle he just kind of loses me I guess the issue with not only dropping the energy level lower but also putting Kurt at the forefront of these songs is that he's not exactly like the most riveting guy on the planet I would call some of these more toned down tracks on this new record over your meditative or even contemplative but the thing is Kurt doesn't even really give us anything to contemplate or chew over with what he's saying a lot of the lyrics on this record just feel kind of empty to me or aimless really the only thing he seems to be kind of engaging with over and over is sort of what he sees is maybe a bit of pointlessness in this thing we call life and Kurt's reaction to that is to kind of create a distraction and become a certified badass and pop a few pills to kind of take the edge off as Kurt sings about people who just kind of fake their way through life and that's life though sad to say however that is an example of maybe just one moment in a song where a lyric pops out and actually makes a pretty poignant statement in the midst of five or six minutes of just very low-key poetic rambling to me songs like wheelhouse on this record are so breezy they're so casual that musically lyrically just really in no way whatsoever does the music make an impression on me sort of like on the song all in a day's work as well which if you just look at the title you can obviously the vibe that Kurt is going for on this record just a lot of the lyrics on this album don't really amount to anything in my opinion but there are at least a handful of moments where Kurt's lyrics are very telling in kind of a personal way sort of like on the song lost my head there which even though the instrumentation is very easygoing and I don't really mind a lot of the easygoing instrumentation if if it was just topped with some better vocals and some better lyrics the instrumentation here actually is very pretty it's very pleasant a lot of the time on this record but I digress despite the instrumentation on this track being so easygoing we have a song here about like mental health or a mental breakdown of some kind Kurt channeling his inner Daniel Johnston a little bit on this track and the lyrics here are kind of dark their poetic they're intriguing and on the track kidding around Kurt goes into his I guess songwriting process his lyric writing process a little bit talking about how maybe some listeners assume that there's some kind of deeper or greater meaning behind a lot of what he's saying when in fact he is just kidding around however this track while I like it and I think it's a very telling moment on this album and it's Kurt actually saying something significant about himself I personally am NOT working under the assumption that there's anything deep going on on a lot of these tracks I think that is in fact the problem Kurt is singing about kidding around as if he's reminding his listeners that he is because they don't know and they haven't figured it out it's very obvious to me on a lot of these tracks and a lot of the songs on his previous records - that he's just fooling around and that to me is kind of what is a turn-off occasionally not that I think Kurt needs to be super serious but a lot of what he is sort of musing about on his record sort of feels like it's only entertaining to him it's a decent record though it's just not as exciting or as intoxicating as a Kurt's last album I don't think and again I don't necessarily feel as if Kurt putting himself at the forefront of these songs and really giving himself that singer/songwriter thrown on this record and just doing away with a lot of the extra effects and the extra instrumentation it didn't have to be the underwhelming move that it kind of is on this record if his vocal delivery was just a little bit more I don't know impassioned or if his lyrics were a little bit more interesting and less aimless this album could have been a little bit more entertaining but as of right now in my opinion I think it's decent it's okay I'm feeling a decent strong six on this thing transition have you given this record of listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Pantano Kurt Vile forever 
7lLnvK6s7I0,back in the spot back in the spot hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our monthly segment where I go over all of my favorite albums from the past month great albums from this past month that I think are worth checking out if you missed my reviews of these records it's been a somewhat fruitful September this year let's get straight into it the latest album that I thought was fantastic was the new Milo record so the flies don't come Milo is an abstract hip hop artist and over some incredibly jazzy intricate smooth and serene beats for mr. Kenney Segal on the production side of things Milo comes through with ironically his most aggressive tracks yet really convincing passionate verses all throughout this record some clever references and wordplay on this thing - this is the best Milo has been sounding in my opinion in a while and then we have a fantastic a stellar a top-notch dream pop record from Miss Julia halter on the album have you in my wilderness some beautiful strings piano vocals sax on this thing just wonderful baroque instrumentation throughout much of the album it's very pretty it's very heavenly it's very blissful I like a lot of Julia's somewhat esoteric lyrics on this record too and her vocals are more upfront than they've ever been she's really selling herself as like a singer-songwriter on this record and it works her voice is playful it's sweet it's got a little bit of quirk sometimes - it's just a fun very alluring record it's cloudy it's pillowy it's wonderful moving on from that to a bit of art punk and post-punk on the new record Sun coming down these guys are jittery they're herky they're jerky they're eccentric it's some really weird noisy chaotic fluid poetic art punk eNOS and I think the band is still yet to fully come to their own but I thought it was a great record and I thought there were a lot of good songs on this thing so if you're looking for a rock record with the I don't know a bit of a strange neurotic edge to it then look into this thing move move move moving on from there the new underachievers album evermore the art of duality the new york hip hop duo comes through with an album that explores the power of choice and the duality of the world it's a cool little concept album and some of the most personal verses to ever land on an underachievers project thus far end up on evermore and it's it's just a really awesome winding set of tracks that just explore I guess kind of this positive side and this dark side of the world and finally shout out to the new Travis Scott album rodeo which in my opinion to sort of put it very bluntly and just put it very simply is kind of like an artist trying to take this new Atlanta sound and I guess refining it a little bit giving it some super artsy and glamorous instrumentals and for the most part I think it works I think it works really well and there's some great tunes on this album 200 stuff that I am still jamming to this day at the end of the month and I think I'll be playing this album on and off until the end of the year and yeah that's it those are all my favorite LPS from this past month I guess I could give a shout out to the new run the jewels meow the jewels remix album - and yeah that's it those are my favorite projects from this past month you're the best thanks for watching all the reviews for these records are of course down in the description you can watch them down there and check out songs from these projects over there - and transition what were some of your favorite albums from this past month let me know and again the reviews for these records is down in the description so if you want to check them out there and I hope you enjoy some of these album as if you haven't tried them out yet and give them a shot as a result of this video I hope you're doing well eat some fruits and veggies get a good night's sleep and make sure to hydrate forever 
aNVJtxegMJo,boom boom thinny boom tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Fetty WAP record it's its self-titled Fetty WAP is a New Jersey singer-songwriter rapper who has been one of this year's biggest hit makers with tracks such as trap Queen which opened up the floodgates for one hit after another tracks like 679 and my way and the song again even little little precious chubby-cheeked George Dalton did a little jazzy cover of trap Queen I don't even know why I'm bringing it up right now it's probably because I can't stop playing it because I have problems however not every single that Fetty has dropped since the release of tramp Queen has been a chart climber but still a vast majority of these tracks end up on this new album over here leaving it feeling a little bit like a compilation as opposed to you know a groomed and nicely sequenced set of songs which wouldn't really be that bad of an album length for maybe some other artists and Fetty certainly has a very recognizable voice a very recognizable sound but he's anything but versatile on this album you're essentially getting a lot of very Club friendly beats with rattling trap flavored percussion these songs bang there are a lot of danceable grooves and then over these instrumentals you are getting Fetty WAPs just howling vocals he sounds like an artist that a bigger rapper would have as a feature to sort of just come on and sing the hook on their song but instead he has become the front runner and he's in the spotlight instead baby won't you come my way and I see that because Fetty WAPs sounds great he sounds good he sounds exciting but only for the amount of time that it would take for maybe a hook to come in because a lot of the vocal lines that he delivers on his tracks while they may be decent he sort of repeats them over and over and over and over to the point where they kind of lose flavor by the end of the song and this is even true on some of his better songs some of his biggest hits like trap Queen and like my way as you can probably imagine the smaller and the less significant songs on this 17 track project don't really vary from that formula in fact it kind of sounds like Fetty and his producers went into this project trying to recreate the success of trap Queen over and over and over and over again - I guess varying degrees of success which is kind of a shame because it sounds like to my ears the Fetty WAPs voice has more potential than just the very repetitive vocal lines he's executing with it as far as singing goes he definitely has better vocals in future and he is certainly more intelligible than a guy like young thug so you can really make out his lyrics but not that that's exactly a selling point a lot of the time since not only are Fetty WAPs lyrics just not that great a lot of them are pretty repetitive - I'm sure they're at least a handful of times I heard a Lu Kang reference throughout this thing as well as the idea of rewinding someone or pressing rewind on a woman that you're trying to get a second chance with or something which is kind of an odd thing to evoke so much on such a new album because people don't even remind anymore that's like it's not even modern technology to rewind things outside of that in the lyrics on this project you're getting a lot of very general trap isms a lot of bricks being flipped a lot of money a lot of bitches etc but we're Fetty kind of varies from this formula to me and and maybe could have been a direction for a lot of the other songs on this record is on tracks like again where Fetty WAP takes this trap world background and makes it into a setting for a love song which again is kind of what he was doing on trap Queen in the first place I also kind of get a similar vibe from the song damn as well as on the track my way which is kind of a seduction song to me this record really is like trap and be it's it's it's more fitting of the the title of trap soul than then is this because the lyrics truly do come from like this trap background but there are a lot of songs on here that you undeniably could call love songs and they're at least sensual in their own weird Fetty WAP kind of way however my issue is is that there's only maybe so many good songs on this project I mean either we have tracks on this project that are outright bad or just feel redundant because what they're doing feels so much alike to the key songs on this project so many tracks here get old before the song is even over because the vocal lines get so stale like on the song jug or on the song time which i think is like laughably sensual or on the track couple bands where the vocals are like the sloppiest on the entire album oh and another thing are these features from this dude Monty on this record I mean one feature on trap Queen really would have been enough but he appears like six times on this record and he's really not that good either his verses are bland and forgettable or he's just copycatting Fetty WAPs already established style he doesn't even really do what a feature should be doing on a track providing a good contrast a good counterpoint a bit of a break from what the main character of the song is doing and you can tell by the end of the record the standard edition of the record Fetty and his producers are really struggling for inspiration because the last four songs here easily some of the worst songs on the entire project I'm pretty indifferent toward this thing I think there are some entertaining songs here that have a short shelf life by are entertaining nonetheless his howls his range his I guess passion that he puts into his vocals it's definitely ear grabbing it's easy to see why he's been able to command the attention that he has I think he just needs to maybe work with some songwriters and some other artists actually craft some better tunes to carry his popularity into the next several years because if he just keeps trying to rewrite trap Queen again and again and again and again his popularity is going to wane very fast especially when the next hot trend and hip hop comes into play and it doesn't require Fetty WAP to do what he currently does he's going to need to change or progress or mature in some kind of fashion at some point if he's going to continue to hold people's attention it's going to be interesting to sort of see where he develops from here I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing transition have you given this wrecker to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it my way were you singing along with it why and let me know what I should review next anthony Fantana Fetty WAP pop pop pop pop forever 
BrYKiJM8Cx8,gotcha look at my beautiful glowing skin in the sunlight coming through on this window no no no this is a review of the new black breath record slaves beyond death black breath is a Seattle band on their third full-length album and it's an LP I've been highly anticipating since the release of their second full-length album sentenced to life an album that I loved that year one of my favorite metal records of that year but black breath is not simply a metal band they fused together elements of crust and hardcore punk thrash metal and death metal a little bit of rock-and-roll - with a buzzsaw guitar tone a lot of D beat drumming some deadly riffs and some very savage vocals to slightly one-dimensional but black breath was certainly so good at doing what they were doing that I didn't really have that much of a problem listening to it for a whole record which wasn't really that long of an album anyway so I was kind of expecting another serving of that as well as what black breath did on their first LP but actually surprisingly the van changed it up significantly on this new album which in a sense I think was a good move because putting out another just kind of thrash crash & bash type album could have gotten old very quick and on this new album in a way black breath kind of takes the subtle route with a lot of melodic slower easier guitar passages a lot more soloing on here and some kind of epic tension building builds to bring us into the meat of these songs which are kind of the same hard-hitting thrash and bash black breath that you've come to know it's an eight-track album and each song is a pretty ambitious ly structured not a single track on here is under five minutes so on paper I think this record is a really exciting and an interesting record for black breath but I do kind of have an issue with what it actually is and my issue is that I think a lot of these slower more subtle parts a lot of these builds a lot of these more melodic guitar passages aren't really that exciting many of are sort of generic not a single one I think is particularly amazing most of the time they are simply decent the whole record starts off with a patient's testing introduction however once we get to the 1:40 mark of the track the song actually starts kicking ass and getting exciting I can appreciate that the band was going for something more dynamic and just a little more diverse but they continually on this album let up on their incredible intensity the incredible intensity that's on their debut record on their sophomore record only to kind of lean on these very average metal melodies and this leads to a lot of tracks on this record becoming incredibly tedious like the chains of the afterlife instrumental which ends the whole album out which I don't like at all and the song seed of Cain which has really filler intro the introduction on the song burning hate doesn't really do that much for me either I mean the guitars are so loud and so blaring at this beginning portion of the song that by the time we get the harder and heavier portion of the song later it doesn't even really feel like we've transitioned into anything significantly different everything is like the same volume it's all still very heavy hard and aggressive and then there are other cuts on here which are somehow a middle ground between these two sides of black breath on this record like arc of violence which isn't too soft but it's not really that intense either kind of feels like a middle-of-the-road black breath though I do like the lyrics on this track and a lot of the other tracks on here they come off really bloodthirsty with mentions of cold night winds and festering haha or the I drag so refrain on the title track of this album which is one of the few tracks on here one of the handful of tracks on here I should say that I actually liked from beginning to end there are some moments on this album or black breath does yield some good results the very heavy and slow verses at the start of this title track are just as hard-hitting as the the frenzied second half and the track a place of insane cruelty the kind of start/stop riffs on here mixed with the very beautiful harmonized guitar solos on here is actually just a good I guess contrast and a good mix of black breaths more melodic and more aggressive side on this record in the song reaping flesh is easily the album's most no BS track and has a really great melodic bridge where okay that's that's a really appropriate place to kind of put that slower just more pretty side of your record it worked really well in that context and the whole album the whole track rather just kicked ass right from the start glided us into this really tasteful bridge and we were done we were there if there is one change on this record that that I could definitely give props to it is the vocals the vocals do seem to change up a little bit on this album they feel like they really have an extreme metal vibe to them as opposed to more of like a hardcore punk vibe as they did on many of the tracks from black breaths previous record there are even some a really ear piercing shrieks especially toward the beginning of the album that seemed a little vector ish in a way overall I thought it was a decent record black breath tried something different sometimes it goes over well sometimes it doesn't I don't think it's anything they should necessarily give up on entirely especially since there are a few spots on this album where this more melodic side of the band did sound great but for the most part it makes a lot of this record kind of a drag I'm feeling a light too decent 6 on this thing Tran black breath uh-huh decision would you think this black breath record did you love it did you hate it are you freaking out over the riffs are you liking those slow heavy parts were you digging the melodies what's going on what's going on here did you dig it did you hate it let me know and what should i review nice anthony Fantana black breath forever 
B0QFxNYgukM,ah matheny now tanto here the internet and it's it's time for a review of meow the jewels is now the jewels or the run the jewels remix album meow the jewels this is the highly anticipated follow-up remix album - the second run the jewels album rtj - a fantastic hip hop duo consisting of killer Mike and LP if you haven't heard of them go check out my review of their last full-length album I actually don't really think you should go into this new album over here unless you've heard that album so again if you have not heard that record if you don't know who run the jewels is please go back there's a link in the description box to that review and shortly after the release and the really amazing success of this album it had been announced by run the jewels that there would be a remix album consisting almost entirely of cat sounds which just in concept everybody was super excited for just the ridiculousness of that concept something that I thought would be fun would be funny maybe ridiculous to the point where I wouldn't want to hear all the way through because it would become grating and annoying and maybe unlistenable and I thought that was actually what was going to happen on this album once I saw that they were a bunch of guests remixers on this record that I guess kind of the talent of this album was going to be spread thin across a lot of different producers brought onto the record to pull together these beats but there were some pretty impressive producer credits going into this thing and we have Geoff Barrow of Portishead appearing on here Zola Jesus Just Blaze of course LP himself Prince Paul The Alchemist and and more and more and many more however this project ended up sounding pretty interesting pretty awesome I think this project is a testament to technology and talent I am very happy that we live in an age where this sort of thing happens pretty much every instrumental here that resemble the original track of this album recreates with incredible accuracy again what's going on musically the key musical the key melodic aspects of these beats are recreated using these cat sounds and it's just so weird and you would think it's it would be so annoying and so obnoxious but often it is a listenable and kind of enjoyable that is if you're into kind of glitchy strange alternative electronic and hip-hop music that is the percussion on this record cat derived I'm not entirely sure but the moments where that pops up it sounds pretty nice as well although I will say that a lot of the beats here are very light very skeletal when it comes to the percussion a lot of these songs off of rtj - that originally were bangers percussion wise are kind of light this time around especially on the Just Blaze song which was kind of unexpected I expected his track to go a little bit harder but still the percussion is kind of light and I think that might be to the effect of I guess enhancing the lyrics and the fact that we're hearing almost nothing but cat sounds and there are some other instrumentals here that take a totally different approach than what the original instrumental was going for and some of these beats actually end up being my favorites on the record like on the blood diamonds remix with the track pod due respect I love the sunny kind of woozy synth chords that dance throughout much of this track and on Zola Jesus's remix the very psychedelic heavy wall of purrs as it's like a swarm of cat sounds surrounding my ears it's overwhelming it's beautiful and it's dark and it's haunting at the same time 3d of massive attack his remix on the end of this project is kind of industrial ish I could praise a lot more aspects of these beats but it won't change the fact that in a way this is a novelty project which inherently is going to make the shelf life of this thing very short so while yeah this is a novelty project it's also an incredibly creative remix album something that I think is really hard to kind of come across I mean remix albums for me while I do like to listen to them if I'm really hardcore into the act that is being remixed a lot of the time they end up being a bit of a wasteland and just kind of feeling like a nun cohesive compilation where some tracks just pale far more in comparison to others I mean often there's only maybe a handful of remixes I end up liking I think now the joules takes that sort of tired concept and makes it exciting again with a really weird stipulation a stipulation that gives this record a really big stick a really big gimmick but I feel like each remix here took took that as a challenge like okay this is going to be a gimmick so that means in order for people to actually think this is good it's got to be really good technically it has to be super sound it can't sound like a joke song even though it's just nothing but cat sounds and that's the thing for something with such a silly idea behind it not a single track here sounds like a joke song which i think is an incredible feat even if I don't love every single track on here I think this is an incredibly impressive remix album and should definitely be tried out by anybody who enjoys run the jewels enjoys killer mics music enjoys LPS music I'm just going to leave it simply at that it's it was fun it was a fun listen I'm glad it happened and I hope more artists in the future maybe not in as much a gimmicky way take the opportunity to sort of guide the artistry of their remix albums a little bit more in the future and provide an interesting a creative strange stipulation to sort of bring all the tracks together and maybe just make remix albums a little more exciting again yeah download it Tran hey have you given this remix album oh listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana now the jewels forever 
yE60qIXvHYg,well hey hi everyone company zero here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new deafheaven record new bermuda deafheaven is a california rock band who and full of years ago started out with a pretty general atmospheric black metal sound but surprisingly came into their own on their last full-length albums sunbather and came through with not only one of the most exciting and popular and most well reviewed metal albums of that year but maybe the most popular black metal album of the 2010s thus far maybe one of the most accessible black metal albums of all time but death heaven didn't get to that point without changing up the blueprint of the genre a little bit to the disappointment of a lot of people who are just hardcore black metal fans who don't really like too much in the way of change the anthemic guitar leads and the kind of screamo style vocals and the very blissful atmosphere surrounding the songs on Sunday there weren't really typical of black metal music but the tremolo guitar picking as well as the blast beat drumming all over this record certainly were and there was a little post rock influence mixed in there as well I think it's safer to say that death heaven is more just an amalgamation of many things even if they are more a metal band than they are anything else and and I can't even really say they're my favorite u.s. black metal act there are other American black metal acts that I find to be far more interesting but still I don't really mind them being sort of the poster boys for it for now now this new record is five tracks long obviously cutting out the interlude tracks that filled up a lot of their last full-length album and provided a bit of a break or a palate cleanser in between all of the endlessly escalating and huge and just triumphant black metal songs that took up a bulk of the album these five tracks on new Bermuda are meaty long cuts about ten minutes or eight minutes so given that the tracks were so long and we weren't getting any interludes I was hoping that these songs would bring some versatility be dynamic and maybe show death have an expanding their musical abilities a little bit and there's actually quite a bit of variety to these tracks rather than finding some space for an interlude on the track listing somewhere death heaven works a lot of these softer more melodic more easygoing moments into the songs themselves the five tracks here are made up of a handful of basic elements we have spots on these songs that are legitimately harsh abrasive black metal some of the most grim and sinister music that deafheaven has recorded so far and then we have passages on here where we get those triumphant guitar leads and solos which we kind of expect it because they end up on the last album some post-rock interludes as well and then we have spots that are very very low-key maybe with a little bit of piano or some acoustic guitar hanging in the background or some very gentle guitar soloing there are a lot of pretty ambitious song structures on a lot of these tracks these songs are just multifaceted and that's definitely something I admire about this album but I can't say that I love everything I'm hearing on this album given that we have five tracks on here and each song is so long and each track has numerous parts to it I don't really hate any one single track from beginning to end rather there are elements or just spots in these songs that I don't care for at all like on the song brought to the water where we get this fade out at the very end of the song which feels like the band didn't really have any ideas as to where to take this part of the song next not only that but the sudden very bland ambient ish post-rock interlude that just introduces itself suddenly I feel like the band forces itself into a purposeful lull or just like a purposeful moment of boredom just so that the next crescendo or explosion of black metal style vocals and guitars sounds more powerful the instrumental rock intro on the song baby blue is way too general to sound distinct or interesting or like anything I mean this sounds like an instrumental bit that a third wave copycat post rock band would come out with on their first recording not a band as seasoned and as celebrated as death heaven and the guitar soloing during the heavier parts on this track doesn't exactly do much for me either by the time the wah pedal gets whipped out in the guitar solo I'm just done and from the sound of the feydau on this track that the band is done too and the Weeping guitar leads and the soft rock rhythm guitars hanging in the background of the song come back are just bland bland bland and the last few moments on the closing track here makes for one of the worst endings on the entire album the whole track starts off with this interesting mix of these kind of dry very abrasive guitars not too heavy but sort of a different mix approach on this track the vocals are incredibly harsh not as swallowed up in the guitars as they are on a lot of other tracks here and I love the heavy riff breakdown sort of in-between the verses on this track but the sudden acoustic guitar strum bit that pops it out of nowhere it's wow it's the I'm just at a loss for words as to how quickly this album goes from 60 to zero and and that's not like speed that's like my level of interest the band just really kills the momentum of these songs in order to transition into these very gentle musical bits that have no flavor or passion or emotion to them whatsoever it's like I'm getting a buffering screen as I wait for the next interesting aggressive bit of music on the record although I will say when this musical section comes back with a piano hanging in the background it's it's not as bad when it was initially introduced now as far as the extreme parts on this record they're incredible they're exciting they're throttling they're explosive they're passionate there again some of the most grim and intense stuff deafheaven has laid to record yet I really have no complaints when it comes to these moments on this album I think they're great however I do understand that these spots wouldn't be as interesting as they are if it weren't for those breaks those moments where death heaven varies from these moments of intensity however these breaks these detours these contrasting musical passages on this record just happened to be very underwhelming it's just not really a good pairing and it's not that I don't think softer music wouldn't pair well with what death heaven are doing during the more aggressive parts on this album it definitely would it's just that I don't really find these passages to be written all that well these kinds of guitar tones and melodies and and chord progressions I could find on any number of inconspicuous post-rock albums that people wouldn't even bat an eye at and it's not that I don't understand people enjoying them here that's totally fine it's just that I think deafheaven during these moments are not really writing up to the level that I would expect them to especially given how fantastic a lot of those triumphant melodies on Sunday there were I thought this record was decent I enjoyed the second track on here pretty much all the way through and even though I don't care for these softer instrumental bits I do like a bulk of what's happening on a lot of the other songs here and I don't really think this was a fall from grace or anything like that and a lot of death having fans certainly seem to be taking to this record well and certainly seem to like what they're hearing but I think the band just too often on this album goes from really definitive really exciting really over-the-top music to something that's just so dime a dozen and anonymous I'm feeling a strong six to eight seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music forever 
Cu4vSPiwoQw,are we where are we where we're not at home we're doing reviews on the road and we're just gonna be doing that for a little while right now but uh while we're here the reviews they're still gonna be the reviews that's it we're just gonna have to sit through it for a little bit longer Milo so the Flies don't come Milo is a Wisconsin rapper yes I believe is his second full-length commercial project I've been following Milo's exploits for a while now for mixtape to mix tape from ep to EP from album to now new album and it's been a pretty interesting road seeing him not only coming to his own and take a pretty unique and interesting approach to hip hop music just in general but also linked up with heroes of his through Hellfire Club which is a rap collective that he's affiliated with it's just been cool to see him over the past few years become an entirely different rap artist even if today he's still kind of rockin with that spoken word ish flow which isn't really super exciting but it's very emotional in delivery I think a lot of the time and Milo also has the tendency to just be a little too obtuse frustratingly obtuse or directionless or aimless large pointed here's what I'm saying type statements aren't really Milo's mo but that seems to be changing a little bit with this new full-length album which in a recent interview with him he told me that it was going to be a more confrontational record and after giving in numerous listens I would have to agree on this new project over here vocally and lyrically Milo is far more expressive than he was on the somewhat monotone toothpaste suburb I would say as expressive as he was on his debut mixtape but at this point he's far more mature and I think has things to say that carry a lot more weight still clever but not so much silly as much as he is I guess aggressive and maybe a little fed up on some of these tracks there's a serious urgency to a lot of what he's saying on this album even if the message he's trying to deliver isn't a parent on the first listen and the newly found fire in Milo's vocal delivery on this LP matches really well with Kenny seagulls beats whoo I understand does the production from beginning to the end of this album and the instrumentals on this record they're synthetic they're serene they're easygoing but they're very melodic and beautiful and intricate they have a very strong jazzy vibe to them as well so if you're looking for some modern synthetic jazz rap this is the record to try I love how eerie a lot of the melodies on this LP are especially on tracks like animist or how sad and somber they can run on the song souvenir which is toward the beginning of this album there is a fantastic and very expressive lyrical feature from hemlock ernst on this track and the first half of the song features mostly milo on here and he lyrically I think is kind of diving into his experiences in LA recently kind of being amongst these art rappers who kind of looks up to and gets a lot of experience and inspiration from but kind of growing sick of the lifestyle and kind of the position that he was in over there which in the interview that I had with him he kind of expressed drove him back to where he is now in Wisconsin to sort of fly solo and do his own thing and on this track lines pop up where he talks about how is a naivete leads him to being taken advantage of how he can rap like a black man he says on the track which is one of the many points on this record where he addresses a lot of racial stereotypes obviously Milo talking about how much he loves hip hop on this record but sort of avoiding doing it in kind of a traditional way much of the time however there are some spots on this record where he is legitimately flowing in the way that you would expect a rapper to flow and he actually sounds great during moments on on the record like this however his lyrics during these spots are especially biting which I like a lot however he doesn't really abandon sort of the more soft spoken and and I guess spacious flows that he's typically known for I would say this record features a pretty good mix of these two sides of Milo he continues to do what he's been doing better while showing us a whole different side of him that he's never really shown this much up until this point on the song Zen scientist Milo over very kind of patient beat is super aggressive in his own I guess kind of Milo way he comes off so determined and hungry on this track and I love the pitched vocals on this song as well as many of the other tracks here too and the vocal feature from Myka 9 is gorgeous as well I love lyrical imagery on this track like the moment where Milo's like kisses down you're on like Gomez rather than giving us this onslaught of lyrical spaghetti to sort of untangle I think he's given us some of the best of the best lyrics that he had for this record and it just leads to this album having a lot more punch like on the song and encyclopedia where I think Milo talks not only about some racial issues on this record but also how he's growing as a rapper making mention of some really interesting turns of phrase on here like when he says this is a mason jar with the last laugh and we get this demonic laugh sort of popping out in the track it's a pretty cinematic and sound rich record also making mentioned the fact that he plays these language games on his tracks with lyrics to the project takes an even more aggressive turn on the song going noplace featuring a lucid who is one of the grimy ax strapper x' in the new york underground right now and milo goes toe-to-toe with him or collaborates with him and keeps up with a flow that at some points feels little Earl inspired and Milo even gets kind of aggressive with his lyrics talking about a giving someone a hook fest totally unexpected for Milo but the thing is he's sounding more frustrated than he ever has on a track and it sounds legit there's just a lot of issues on this record where my low is venting really hard on a lot of things that he seems to have some very strong opinions on or just had negative experiences with while writing lyrics on this album like on the track true nen with open mike eagle who has a very cartoony over-the-top verse in the second half but Milo in the first half is again sort of going into this craft that he has such an incredible passion for talking about how he avoids soda because he can't afford health insurance because he writes rap songs for a living on the track yo Milo which I guess is kind of named after his Twitter account but in a way is kind of a series of snide and sort of tongue-in-cheek and clever responses to people who listen to his music who I think he doesn't feel has like a full understanding of what exactly he does or what he's trying to do talking about how he purposefully makes the lyrics abstract and and the messages that he says difficult and obtuse and and leaves the listeners playing with and fiddling with little pieces and bits of the images how he has people talking about how he's their favorite artist as far as like music that black people are making goes and unexpectedly this track occurs over what is pretty much like a dance beat yeah Milo on top of like a dance beat it's strange but it actually works Milo's flow which is way more traditional on this track than it is on any other song here is fantastic it actually goes over really well and he gets even speedier on the closing track on here which is an ode to bus driver which isn't too surprising not only because Milo just holds him in such high regard but there are some moments on this record where I really feel like he was heavily influenced by a lot of what bus driver was doing on his last full length album perfect hair sort of riding these fringes between making something that is abstract that is obtuse but is simultaneously very bold and in-your-face and uncompromising I feel like Milo went into this record right here with the same general concepts but had a completely different outcome because he's a completely for an artist's still though he does a really great job of I guess painting a surreal and playful and flattering picture of bus driver as a rapper as an artist while toward the beginning of the album he seems kind of frustrated with what might have been the short end of the stick while playing so closely shoulder to shoulder with a lot of these people while he was more affiliated more involved with Hellfire Club he still seems to have an incredible amount of admiration for these artists who have influenced him so much I really love this record I think it's Milo's best since his things that happen today things happen at night EPS I will say though I wished it was a little longer I mean this room is really maybe one or two tracks away from an EP and there are some songs on here like true nen as well as animist which I just wish were longer or had a stronger ending to it but even with a lack of incredibly strong endings on a handful of these tracks because there are some songs that dip right into the next track interestingly this record is still very fun it's very bold it's very moving there's a lot of large strong statements on this album even on the softest track here napping under the echo tree where Milo his flow style is just shoulder to shoulder with spoken word on this track and the beat is really slow-motion very syrupy very slow-paced and there's some wonderful strings woven into this very pitched sample and Milo's lyrics on this track are are easily some of the most powerful on the entire record if you're looking for a rapper who has a very alternative approach against some pretty melodic instrumentals with a strong jazzy flavor to them I mean I really think in a lot of ways Milo is kind of advancing the whole idea of jazz rap a little bit a little bit and it just goes over super super well super super tasteful and personal and and and wonderful it's it's awesome to kind of get this kind of in-depth look into Milo's psyche when it comes to these very intense emotions on the topics that he addresses throughout this record you really got to pay attention the lyrics on this thing but it's definitely worthwhile it's definitely worth reading into he's not quite as confusing as he typically can be and I think he really makes a real istening to this album worthwhile with his lyrics and also with Kenny seagulls a wonderfully intricate and just very pretty instrumentals I'm just going to keep saying nice things about this album if I keep going I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that said Anthony Fantana music forever 
A1z6FLD8yCo,Hey hi everyone front that he bought um oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new front bottoms record back on top these guys are a New Jersey rock band with five records under their belt now even what I can see and over the course of these albums the band has embraced a mix of punk music and folk music and a little bit of pop punk and a splash of Indian emo and their songs usually have kind of a strong pop edge to them too which is definitely the case of their last two full-length albums and from the sound of it back on top seems to be the front bottoms most catchy and kind of well groomed album yet it's a little slick the folk music influences are pretty much evaporated on this LP there are a few spare like little acoustic moments here and there on this record but there's not like a really strong folky sort of very prominent acoustic guitar sound that carries from one end of a song to another this is a very electric album with some very thick heavy prominent bass it's got a very I want to say heavy but not too overpowering mix of guitars and bass and drums reminds me a little bit of a old-school Weezer there's an element of power pop here in the mix but then with the vocals I think we get this very shouted urgent very kind of pained vocal delivery that reminds me a lot of some old against me records not bad artists to pull from influence wise and what the front bottoms are doing isn't really that difficult from a complexity standpoint aside from a few shots of horns here and there on the record but I still think what the front bottoms are doing with their songs with their lyrics is really good I mean they're really delving into some intense emotional states and personal stories it feels like more than just an exercise in melodrama which is how a lot of newer emo and pop punk records just feel to me because there are some lines lyrically that really stick with me on this record like with the opening track right from the get-go the front bottoms are sounding really cat cheaters coming out right from the gate with a good tune sometimes you gotta close your eyes to truly see the night just a really sharp tried and true chord progression on this track along with the song help killer hook on the song killer hook and the lyrics I think kind of describes someone who is in this just amazingly clueless and helpless state it's a pretty strong character portrait I think and on the song laughs til I cry another top notch hook here and lyrically the band seems to be describing I don't know this idea of maturing or growing up we have our protagonist in the song talking about how they used to party all the time and now they've kind of just grown out of that or sort of change their mind I think a lot of these themes are extended on the song historic cemetery and while it isn't one of my favorite tracks on the record the rap verse from GD P and the back end of the song was a surprise and was actually a pretty enjoyable it's it's rare that a hip-hop verse ends up on a punk record or a pop punk record or an emo record or whatever and it turns out tasteful and the closing track on here I thought was pretty decent too was this cute little pop rock tune which sort of takes comfort in the idea of some kind of greater plan for your life by I don't know a god or a greater power or something and I feel like there's a narrative being pulled together here with the imagery of the plastic flowers and the victims family in the emergency room but the lyrics are just too esoteric to pull it all together into a story that I think has any real impact and that's kind of the shame sometimes with these lyrics there occasionally just so abstract and so I guess broken and fractured that it's difficult for me as the listener to really I don't know get anything emotionally out of it even though it sounds like the band is certainly having a I guess an emotional exorcism on record a lot of the other tracks on here really aren't anything to write home about they just really feel like very general emo pop punky power pop though I will say my least favorite moments on this record are when the instrumentation and everything just sounds so slick and so groomed and commercial that I think the band loses really all of its rock edge sort of like on the third track here which has some very sweet little sugary keyboard melodies on it and I think the biggest offender of this is maybe the plan a job which certainly sounds like the plan is to say jobs on here because instead of just turning your life you know into some sort of nine-to-five for some kind of big company you're kind of turning your record into something that sounds like a nine-to-five with these overly slick pianos that if you grabbed an instrumental bit from this part of the record of this part of the song you could easily put it behind a commercial like in a music bed for some new Apple product or maybe some kind of a granola candy bar that's marketed to people who are health-conscious I thought this album was okay I thought I had a lot of decent things going on for it the production for the most part aside from the slicker tracks on here was decent there was at least a handful of very good catchy songs on here just occasionally I think with each song not really varying too far from the the blueprint of a song like help of a song like motorcycle some tracks just kind of pale in comparison to others there's just not that much variety on this album honestly and sometimes the lyrics don't really connect in a strong way sometimes the lyrics are pulling out some really interesting imagery but they fail to pull it together into a portrait of something as soon as it was decent it was decent I'm feeling like a decent strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music forever hey everyone you know who it is Antoine Phan Tuan here and on your page right now you are seeing a picture of our brand new website

PTNTqWto9yA,ooh yeah ooh yeah uh hi everyone don't finish a tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Giulia halter record have you in my wilderness Giulia halter is a singer/songwriter a pop artist of sorts whose previous full-length albums ran pretty ambient especially her breakout projects like tragedy and ecstasy my personal favorite is loud city song her last full-length album and in the case of loud city song the instrumentation was really ethereal it was sweet it was very serene very calming relaxing music on the surface doesn't really sound like anything that should be demanding too much attention but the songs were so good and just shined through so brightly that they didn't really need to be played at a loud peppy volume in order for their magic to really translate now there were some singles leading up to this new full-length album over here that had me very excited for it excited for it and anticipating a bit of a change of pace because the songs teasing toward this record were some of the most loud upfront bright and bold songs that Julia holter has written in a while so I went into this record looking forward to a more intimate upfront close and personal Julia halter not only because of those singles but also the the title here have you in my wilderness I sort of thought going into this record that I was going to be going to a place a very personal place and sort of get to know Julia a little better through her music which is something I've had hard time doing because even though I've loved her music in the past it sounded very beautiful very pretty very dreamy I never really got a strong sense of her personality as a songwriter so it would be interesting to hear Julia put out a more personality driven record songs like sea calls me home are nothing but personality driven kind of very steadily paced piano pop with some kind of eccentric vocals on this track and a few other moments here julia doing her best kind of Neko vocal very slow deep dramatic but also very captivating and emotional too and the rest of this record is much clearer than some of the stuff julia has put out in the past it's still a kind of soft-spoken and shy record but julia has really given herself nowhere to hide in the mix she's really there in your face even if it is in a very quiet way and her vocals are just thrusted up by this gorgeous lavish heavenly instrumentation these pianos and strings and drums that sound wonderful they shimmer they shine the production here is so modern it's so clear it's so layered it's so clean and fresh and new but it kind of has a I don't know something to me of a Phil Spector ish vibe with just how orchestral and kind of blissful a lot of the instrumentation sounds a lot of the instrumentation here the string sections especially are very intricate and they're dense but simultaneously the music feels so weightless a lot of these songs sound as if I am just floating on a cloud towards some kind of golden gate with wonderful bright sun rays peeking out from behind all of these I guess cloudy pillowy walls of white and in delivering this feeling julia kind of finds opportunities to bring some variety to the table to in the case of Lucette stranded on the island I love how repetitive a lot of the lyrics and the musical phrases on this track are and as they are repeated the instrumentation just thickens and intensifies to the point where it gets a little overwhelming and there are other tracks too that feel as repetitive and as droney as well but bring a different vibe like on the song how long which is incredibly sinister and dark and dreary maybe the dreariest moment on the entire record I almost said Nico there but Julia's vocals here do remind me a Nico a little bit again on this track specifically her record marble index although I've been listening to the album a lot lately so maybe that's why I kind of pull from that album instantaneously but this is a really dark baroque pop on here the strings are really weeping in the background on this track and Julia's vocals are just really bellowing and very deep and very dramatic and I love the lyrics on this track - and the song Vasquez toward the back end of this record is very light on the ears a lot of spoken word passages in the first half reminds me a little bit of Kate Bush's fifty words for snow in a good way although maybe it is my least favorite track on the entire record because it does seem to be the least engaging for me on the record maybe it's the one song where I think it gets lost in its own atmosphere a little bit without being as direct as many of the other tracks here even though the album is very soft-spoken the songs are very upfront and very sweet and very instantaneous to me a lot of the time in their own sort of way whereas Vasquez is a very esoteric and kind of dodgy witch it might grow on me with further lessons to the record and then there's another side of this LP where I think Julia is really showing off her pop chops in a way and just writing some of the the peppiest tunes i've ever heard her sing the song every time boots one of my favorite tracks on here on this song definitely get your jazz hands out the very uh just jovial piano chords all over this track are fantastic and and Julia's vocals bring forward a lot of personality she's very fun she's very playful awful I love the luscious strings on this track I love the romping drums as well and kind of the little tap tap ax percussion on here as well I could I could imagine a good tap dance number to this track the song she calls me home which I mentioned earlier but another thing that I love about this track the weird whistling passage in this song is really unexpected but fun and the sax solo it's one of the loudest freakiest most aggressive moments on the entire record and I love how we get a sax in the left channel and a sax in the right channel just kind of doing different things or maybe it's just kind of a chorus of the same take kind of at a different time or something but it's really psychedelic and and and weird I love to hear a dream pop record that is so ethereal and so serene but it's taking like these incredible instrumental risks sometimes like this record while it does have it's very relaxing moments every once in a while like on this track it just busts through with something loud Boldin and crazy which makes these moments even more significant because they stick out because of how intense they are but I think maybe my favorite track on the entire record is Betsy on the rooftop where I think Julia's most impassioned and exciting vocal performance on the entire record is on this song I love the way her passion just and her volume just escalates along with the instrumentation as it continues along and this song with many of the tracks on here Julia delivers these really haunting refrains just hauntingly beautiful did I do so bad and I guess I'll use this opportunity to get into the lyrics a little bit they are esoteric but intriguing as well Julia isn't really telling these kind of personal me me me me me type stories and her lyrics I think she just gives us enough of an image to kind of go off of and pull things together a little bit but beyond that there's really not much to what she's singing in what she's saying it sounds like a lot of what she's on about in the lyrics comes from a very personal place but I feel like we are kind of lost in Julia's wilderness on this record we're getting these little bite-sized and obscured portions of maybe her experiences or dreams or something lyrics are definitely a point where Julia is definitely obscured while her vocals may be very clear on this record what she's singing about isn't always however she does at least make sure to pair a lot of these tracks with some great choruses and with some great refrains to make them catchy and make them memorable and again just enough is given to us to make what she's singing about sound kind of intriguing or haunting in some kind of way especially on the closing track where she is singing about a this person running away from her which kind of makes the very abrupt ending to this track kind of fitting although I wouldn't say that the abrupt endings on a lot of the previous tracks are all that fitting a few of them really do kind of ruin the song for me especially on the track how long slightly on the song night song if there is one big kind of Achilles heel to this record it's that I wish Julia wrote some stronger endings for some of these tracks it certainly seems to be intentional and in some of the cases on these songs I think it works how Julia kind of will have a really intense musical moment on one of the songs or give us a really catchy refrain and then kind of just Peter the song out really quickly not too bad but during a few moments here it does feel like some of these tracks still had a little more life in them but she kind of cuts it off a little prematurely other than that I think it's an incredible record it's one of the best baroque and dream pop records I think I've heard in a while and it's awesome to hear Julia kind of flexing her vocal and her singer/songwriter muscle giving us a record with a little more personality and her coming through with just fireworks on a lot of these tracks very subtle fireworks I'm loving the songs the production the instrumentation the vocals on this thing and it's easily one of the prettiest records I've heard this year not a whole lot of complaints about this thing mostly praise it's a great LP make sure you listen to it I'm feeling a light 9 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music forever 
XSt_pIG3PRk,hi everyone don't finish shave tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for yet another installment of my seven inches where I go deep deep down into the sort of bottom shelf of my little vinyl shelf over here and talk to you about my 45 collection my single collection my 7-inch collection should maybe take one more video to finish this out let's just get straight into it these are these are my singles and down there in the description box of course there's a link to a whole playlist of my other vinyl videos where you could see the other records that I have in this shelf alright so last time we left off with this whole 7-inch the family trees 7-inch for the tracks dream talkin and baby come back on a side and here's a 7-inch that's actually one of my favorites comes off of hardly art dropped in 2010 was one of the singles from one of my favorite albums of that year I believe or maybe the album came out a year after the single drop of Ferguson Geronimo turning blue dabu and never satisfied Digg Ferguson Geronimo's earlier stuff and you know much of what Andrew savage was doing in the bands that would come sort of afterwards or the albums that would come afterwards and yeah this is this was kind of I guess a I guess my intro to his music sort of Ferguson Geronimo so you know I'm glad I came across this single came across Ferguson Geronimo in general that's kind of a nice little punky tune I don't know that's it's a bit of a slacker sort of sense of humor to it to that I think is really cool I love the turning blue sort of I guess spray on the other side there's a little hardly art postcard in there and it's actually blue half white half blue blue get it that's wonderful wonderful vinyl humor for you a little bit of vinyl humor Wow Wow sorry I'm being annoying I'll try I'll try harder in the future to not be annoying or maybe I'll try to be annoying let's see how that turns out alright I got a little Roberta Flack here with killing me softly with his song with his song on Atlantic and on the b-side we have trade winds alright some nice sweet soul there for you and it's just straightforward black 7-inch oh man this is a this is an oldie have this one for a while had this one since college this is a Ben Folds single for the track landed although I don't really care for that I have this 7-inch mostly for the b-side the the b-side is an ever so ironic piano cover very somber and very depressing cover of bitches ain't so you know if that's how you like to roll then you know that's uh that's there for you it's not really any other way to describe it other than you know it's just kind of like a white person silly white person silly cover of a hip hop tune of which there are many more now back then when that single dropped it was like sort of you know new oh this is kind of weird this is funny this is kind of funny but now it's kind of like you know what is that George Daulton kid covering that Fetty WAP trap queen track yeah that's a that's sad that's really sad all right so anyway moving forward a little bit of foreigner here with the track if you like a little bit of 80s pop rock look into foreigner lots of hits can't stop these hits head games double-vision some other releases here that they're recommending on the backside of this 7-inch there we go and girl on the moon on the b-side

blue cover not much to the inside it seems just simple just a simple 7-inch people just a simple 7-inch can't complain about that can't complain forward iron hand this is like a bit of a hard course of an inch I believe that I got from the guys over at red scroll records they pass it along to me nice boys nice very well-behaved boys over there at that red scroll records store in Wallingford shout out to them for hooking me up whenever they come out with a record of their own bit of a lyric sheet here for tracks and just a a plain white label you just don't know what to expect man what does this 7-inch behold again the name of this group iron hand usurper divine this is some you know grimy crusty hardcore dark people so if you're on the lookout for some of that witch that you know there's there's a lot of it but there's a lot of good stuff out there too iron hand usurper divine alright we're keeping it dark oh this one's fun this is a fun way I've had this one since like high school I think this is an oldie this is an oldie for me this comes from hand by the name of iron prostate brought to you by screaming skull records a Skyclad label p.o box 666 Middlesex New Jersey zero eight eight four six that probably doesn't exist anymore 1991 Skyclad records and the single which I bought just based off of the cover and the title alone is a rock and roll nursing home which it's a pretty decent track this fun song I've traded and sold and given away a lot of records that I've that I bought over the years and this one has stuck with me because it is it is a fun one-of-a-kind single that rock and roll nursing single who doesn't want to own it and it's a nice sort of like splattery kind of greyish blue color to it and the B side what's the B side I am Gilligan I'm Gilligan don't really recall if I liked that track I might not have this might just be one of those singles that the a side is the only good one but that a side it's a hell of an a side that rock and roll nursing home so you know if you were ever looking for I believe the hook goes something like rock rock rock rock rock of all and dare I say home I may just be completely making that up because while I do have very fond memories of that single I could just be making it the hell up this one not isn't entirely a 7-inch though it's technically a 7-inch I guess it is the big kind of pop-up book package like a reissue CD deluxe version of AMD's black bastards and the thing about this even though it does have a CD in there I've shown this during a during a vinyl update I did around records stored a while it is mostly a CD and it's a reissue it's also got a 7-inch pist picture disc excuse me I was gonna say Pistor disc but that wouldn't be right it's also got a 7-inch picture disc there's the side in the B side and it just slides right into the top just goes up above above but I am which is nice very dark cover art though very dark cover art so you know if you're looking to get into it if you're MF DOOM fan this is this is MF DOOM back in the day this MF DOOM pre MF DOOM so if you're looking for some hip-hop but a jazz rabbit a boom bap with a strong lyrical flavor

Sanada shake it down at a time to definitely look into this single if you haven't heard this single a lot of y'all who grew up with movies like Beetlejuice who are about my age probably remember this song very fondly but if you're younger and you haven't seen that movie and you have not heard of Lord flea look into this guy really fun and also on the b-side naughty little flea which I can't

great band have had this one for a while too man or Astro man inside the head of mr. Adam um it's a decent single from what I can recall I like their albums a lot more than what the think they were doing on this single but I was just kind of happy to have a piece of Manor Astro man vinyl in the collection which is really cool again let's see okay so this is like something that's so much a single as much as it is an EP because this seems to have four tracks on it so yeah so it's not even the a side and the B side it's the forebrain and the hindbrain side on this and we have two tracks on one side Heric waves inside the atom on the forebrain side and on the hindbrain side we have put your finger in the socket in 24 hours so some really cool instrumental rock from Manor Astro man you know don't expect something like you know post rock song or anything like that nothing dramatic I mean it's just very fun it's fast paced it's high-energy it's kind of punky a little surf rock inspired to a man or Astro man definitely look them up if you're looking for a fun band alright we'll do a couple more this is uh Afrika Bambaataa covering kick out the jams with MC 5s original kick out the jams on the other side which I thought was just kind of crazy it's a it's a little RINO side-by-side Record Store Day exclusive 7-inch with a beautiful white and red splatter very wonderful color so that was a cool cool pickup had to get that when that dropped on Record Store Day oh yeah oh yeah meatloaf two out of three ain't bad on Columbia can't hate that single can't hate that single a little bit of piano rock there for the piano rock fans and well I think we'll finish off with this this is kind of an elaborate little thing here and then I think maybe we'll do one more I will do one more vinyl video and we'll probably finish off all the seven inches well we'll do two more here we have the MGMT single for congratulations which I love this song it's the album version and then we have the remix on the other side and it's a nice little package for this 7-inch kind of tells a bit of a visual story based off of what MGMT did on the music video kind of the desert setting and all of that and then once you open it you've got the pages how it looks like a bit of a storyboard or something or like you know visuals to kind of I guess kind of tell a tale of what they were they were doing in the music video with this kind of like you know bird looking alien character in a crashed spaceship a gravesite in all four seasons and like a dead astronaut like a little bit of a comic you know it comes with this 7-inch crazy so you know really interesting packaging just for this nice little psych pop single which is definitely one of my favorite MGMT songs haven't really cared for a lot of their newest material but I do think a lot of the songs on their debut and a lot of the songs on congratulations or our good Tunes good Tunes and finally I want to give a shout to a nice little like hardcore punk 7-inch from the boys and Minor Threat we got salad days stumped and good guys don't wear white on the same little 7-inch EP look at that looking like nice boys some times good guys don't wear white and we have just kind of like a plastic sleeve for the 7-inch itself of course released on disc court records and I think we got like a poster here which I have not that's just like a little insert pictures of everybody in the band yeah if you're a fan of hardcore punk you probably seen these pictures a million times Gibson nice Gibson guitar and Ian Makai looking like a winner there alright and those are essentially the seven inches we are going to be covering in this video if you haven't heard any of these songs if you haven't heard any of these artists definitely do a youtube search do do a Google search on this stuff of course I have also listed all the artists all the seven inches featured in this video in the description box as I usually do and yeah that's it I hope y'all are doing well having a nice day believing in yourselves and here on some good music love you forever

Zeb Dean's hey dude thanks man no thank you thanks for coming on and just I don't know kind of peeling back the curtain front from over what you do well well I mean I think uh I don't know the first thing I want to ask you I mean I think the first music video that you've ever done that really struck me by surprise and just really grabbed my attention was that music video that you did for a curtain which for that portal track which was easily one of my favorite music videos of that year and it was just really a a mix of different things I mean it kind of seemed like some old school sort of puppetry and set design was sort of involved in the process of making that video but it seemed like there was I don't know but possibly a lot of digital editing and effects as well but I mean all of it seemed so grimy I couldn't quite tell what was real and what was sort of analog and what was kind of the digital aspect to what you were doing because while it does seem to borrow like from a lot of I guess the visual effects that you would see in like very very old like horror movies like the type of horror films before they even had an audio track you know it's it seems like you're borrowing from that era of visuals but you've just translated it into the modern era so nicely that it kind of keeps and maintains it's sort of old-school flavor absolutely yeah they're huge fans of blonde Cheney and I mean even the titles I used I fashioned after some classics like and you know the Opera and the original Dracula and things like that yeah I mean would you say those are you know your your kind of major reference points for these videos I mean do they run any deeper than that would you say for that one in particular that's basically some brothers way going on there as well just a lot of handmade stuff and my favorite part about that like you said mixing the modern and the old is a lot of people thought it was stop-motion a lot of people who would contact me and will work with me would assume that it would stop motion and that means I totally succeeded in tricky motion and all that would have taken readers instead of one yeah absolutely I mean it's it didn't strike me as that at all when I first saw because it just seemed too fluid um especially the whole part where in that particular music video where you're kind of going down the throat of the worm yeah which which was really a nightmarish okay can you can you go into maybe how you how you went about doing that because I mean that's that's one of the freakiest things I mean I think I've not just seen in a music video I mean if that sort of thing two showed up in a regular movie it's it seemed a little uh it seemed Tim Burton ish but maybe a little too edgy for to end up in a Tim Burton project I mean obviously as a child some of this work when it was worth anything yeah and then you know oh yeah yes yes yes yes there's just so much I don't know I mean I'm just sort of talking about the thing and guessing at it and you're sort of you know confirming how I feel about it I mean can you tell me maybe what was one of the hardest things to execute about this music video like you know give us little detail as to sort of what exactly kind of you know went into one particular aspect of it which was really time-consuming yeah I mean the whole thing took about a year it was my first first time I really force myself to take a chance and do everything I wanted to do for a video I think a lot of the times I would approach artists with these grandiose massive ideas starting out and I didn't really have a realistic sense of how to deal with a budget or anything like that so that was kind of the first time I forced myself to do have everything I wanted to do from start to finish a hook took a very long time to be shooting and of course the building the miniatures and figuring my way around some of the visual tricks because you're right there's a lot of digital stuff tucked in there to make things work but there's well most of it is handmade and a lot of the things that move moving parts and all those that's all real as well so there were a lot of instances where I had to rebuild entire structures after realizing something wasn't going to work hmm cause I'm not I'm not very technically proficient I'm coming from an art background where things don't need to move more function they just need to look good on the surface so then hang out how to make that stuff work and also figuring out how to shoot it properly was a pain in the ass in general as far as any particular instance when it became too difficult I think I was having too much fun to feel to ever feel frustrated in a in in the kind of sense where it felt like it wasn't gonna work well you know oh yeah I'm working on what you love you know yeah yeah but the whole thing was so it so I mean um hmm so you considering how long you worked on the music video you definitely were doing it even before the album was released right yeah no I think I didn't approach them until the album came out oh really yeah oh it felt like that music video came out not too long after the record but maybe I'm just came out nine months after okay okay yeah so like the album came out in early February I remember it all of us well yeah like it was at least nine months I think I think came out in February then we released it on Halloween hmm and so yeah so how exactly all right so so referencing something kind of direct that happens in the music video what are sort of the mechanics of kind of the stage that you had sort of built together and how it kind of rised up and sort of appeared as kind of this worm form and the teeth kind of came in and and it just kind of seems like so many moving parts that all need to like fluidly you know sort of come together in order for it all that make sense you've seen what you're seeing varying scales of miniature there you're seeing the the stage itself which is we see in the majority of the like maybe the first two thirds of the video which is like that's that's maybe like I'd say that from what you see on screen it's about three to four feet high Oh six wide that the the stage structure that becomes a head that's how big that is and then you know so it's got so there's a certain scale of teeth and curtains and the room that I'll fit in within that and then when we see a like a full shot of the creature it's like it's actually like the size of a sock puppet basically hmm so there's two different scales were working in basically so like I would have to recreate the scene again later smaller to create the illusion that the whole thing is actually rising up and has it's just a head of a larger body all right okay and and and sort of in the midst of all these sets in these kind of hand designed you know pieces that are going into this project I mean what exactly are the very subtle digital elements that are tucked in there that are kind of hard to you know pick up on sort of like at one point where we're seeing this like you know large widescreen picture of the stage itself with all these kind of white figures there I mean is there a white figure there for each Spira I mean is all that kind of edited in there or that was um that was that was for yeah for people including myself with hot glue guns haha making tiny tiny little ghosts two days I think maybe it was one day but it felt like a long time because one of my friends talks a lot and wouldn't shut up so sorry felt much longer than then it would I think you see there like the things that are digital or like okay so the main character is an actor in front of a green screen my friend Bradley Bailey's is incredibly talented and basically you know I haven't felt like someone with the news that told him on a couch filming me so we actually had him suspended at one point mmm so I had I worked with a friend who has like a rigging set up in their studio for that so mainly what like the the primary digital effects are just comping the actor into these scenes to make him seem like make it seem like the stages is life-size hmm that was the real trickery there most everything else is real yeah yeah like the the film like the film grain is a 16 millimeter film that was then turned into a transparency oh okay yeah digitally yeah so that's what kind of gives it that old-school feel sort of shooting on that older medium and then transferring it over yeah well that was no no actually shot on shot on like shot using a modern relatively connor based on what i could have afforded at the time digital camera and then and then I then I used 16 millimeter footage that was from like the beginning for real and then and looped that put it uh yeah okay issues maybe I should have told you that's what I did because that sounds like that well I mean before we started the interview you you've said that it would take another question or two to get the truth out of you so that's that's that's that's with what you said so you know you're you're not lying you're you're telling the truth um so moving onto this Chelsea Wolfe video that you did for the song mayor which was off of apocalypsis I believe and I I think one of the most interesting things about this video is just kind of those scenes or you kind of have Chelsea and kind of this grayish green issue room with all the you know sort of tree candelabras and it's sort of interesting how you kind of got this feel going where she's sort of moving independently of the background sometimes and I like how sort of the way that you've sort of starkly contrasted her skin with her clothes and her hair and she looks so black and white it's almost as if she's sort of like this you know this black and white figure from an older horror movie just kind of placed into this background that you've created that's a you going well another kind of interesting thing about the video is sort of the way you kind of through those little old-school waves in there like was sort of what was the what was the inspiration behind that I mean you know when talking to somebody like Chelsea wolf and kind of having her in the video is there more difficulty when you're trying to I guess kind of do a music video where you're sort of trying to spotlight a personality as opposed to what you're doing with the portal where you kind of had like a really odd storyline there that you could kind of work with and sort of you know do your own thing whereas with with the music video like this it seems like you've got to be more focused on kind of giving the artist sort of an aura or kind of using your video to paint a portrait of the artist and kind of yeah communicate to the audience like what they're all about yeah I mean it's just different every time if you look at the work each each project I mean there's their similarities but ultimately I try to be as delicately cater to the artist I'm working with as possible and with her she's very shy but she's also very graceful and so it's a matter of like having enough going on outside of she doesn't want it to just be all about her you know she's she's got a huge huge interest in film she's a big Bergman family both are and there was a there was a lot going on there but I also made sure that we got enough of her in the video because she's captivating she's got a lot of power so so or do you kind of have an idea in your head previously as to how you want to showcase a particular artist I mean I I think in a really odd way in a way that I can't even really under exploited ooh it I can't even really begin to describe as to how you sort of picture liturgy in the way that you did on the song returner you know the the the visuals with kind of the old architecture as well as kind of this weird angular mirrored look to almost all the shots that that goes throughout the whole music video I'm kind of a perfect way to paint a picture of the band I mean is this kind of uh what their music was inspiring you to do if we were going to so so with them I initially approached them with another grandiose miniature based idea that was very different than the portal one but it was equally involved and they were really excited about it and then the label the label thought it would be important to actually do a video first where we where we showed them hmm where we because then I think that's you know that's one of the big talking points about them is who they are what they look like despite people just listening to the music enjoying it for that and so I had to quickly come up with something and that was the song that we all agreed on would work as a first single because it was understood it was gonna do two and then that just sort of happened organically based on the lyrics I think and and this sort of playing with with the artwork from the album as well um this sort of you have the you know the right side up upside down crosses and all this sort of references to reflection in the lyrics this even the nature of the name of the song returner it's like it's facing each other you know it's like there's just this kind of sentiment of inversion hmm with the whole thing so that just kind of sprang from that very quickly it was all done very quickly and wraps very quickly as well and then we started working on the next thing and then Greg blue band and and you all just it all just sort of took a break yeah all right um that's there are other music videos here I just want to ask you about before uh before we go but what you just were saying there just kind of makes me want to ask you just about your dealings with bands and labels and kind of the the current state of music videos and kind of what it means to be a creator kind of in this medium uh have have you had you envisioned yourself kind of going down this road a long time ago as music videos ever are always been a point of inspiration for you or are you just you know this visual artist here who just kind of saw a bit of a calling or a place where you sort of be able to fit in and create some art that you were really proud of right I mean face basically I was you know I've always been an artist but and a boss also always had music as a heavy influence but I think I worship film more than anything and I didn't expect to start doing music videos I was just I was making eye patches or something at this one point and I started talking to Geneva jacuzzi about like oh like you know she was interested in one and then she just sort of it just sort of happened organically that I ended up doing a video for her mmm Fluellen a stated stay with her an aerial paint for a while is very strange and just all of a sudden I was a music video director and yeah I loved it because every single medium that I love to do all coalesce into this one thing sure and and which then just sort of reminded me spell itself and that's definitely going to happen now in the far too relatively nearby future but I love music videos I was raised on them we all were our generation had MTV and I think I think that it's just a perfect excuse to combine the two things I love more than anything so I'm never gonna get tired of it but I might also start doing films as soon as I can yeah yeah so definitely it's it feels like a stepping stone that I won't ever hopefully stop doing continue doing it but yeah well what's kind of interesting to me is sort of looking back at that I guess Geneva jacuzzi music video I mean it sticks out to me more than any of the other ones because it just kind of seems to me ever since then you've you very quickly gravitated to a lot of groups that play a lot of metal music and a lot of music that's just generally very dark and I think from the Chelsea Wolfe video to the portal video to the behemoth the video to this new video with ghosts you've you've drawn up a very I guess recognizable style and in just like a handful of these music videos since you've been doing them yeah yeah one one you know the bands use something and they they see that you've done it with a certain band they like they'll send you your metal music video director director and I don't mind that all because I know metals been a huge part of my life now but yeah my musical my actual interests in music are much more broad than that as you may or may not see in the near future but but I you know I love now i think i think the portal video had such a huge impact compared to the work I had done before that that just sort of kings' define me when people are looking for these things and so I think a lot of labels when when they're looking for like the right package they lately been going for its big new pilot for album art and me for music videos hmm and then sort Anish I just sort of fell into which I certainly don't mind at all but yeah Geneva was the first one open and definitely still love her music and things like that as well so it'll be interesting to see what happens is I branch out a little more do you have any sort of music video projects coming down the pipe that you could tease toward right now or is that pretty much under wraps I question I wish I knew that I will say that I'm about to start working on something with with an axe that I've worked with before mm-hmm and and then there's another one that does a little outside of the heavy spectrum that then I'm about to work for as well okay and yeah anything a super duper duper close to finished or just like already in the can and about to be released at some point this year yes there is there's something that and it's the labels just figuring out their release plan but this thing was finished in the in the winter and it's for a musician that I dearly love who was prominent in the eighties and this is sort of part of a comeback package but he has a lot to do with Egypt and that's all I'm allowed to say okay well it's just okay everybody at home can figure it out from there moving on from from that sort of you know knowing that that labels want to get these music videos done while it does seem that there's a very strong artistic element to what you're doing and that you know in the case of a video like Kurt and it seems like an incredible amount of artistic freedom in what you're doing I guess what Kant also kind of be forgotten in the midst of what you're doing is that it's it's also kind of promotional in a sense - oh yeah I mean you're making stylized commercial oh yeah so absolutely so I mean I I guess you know is is is that the kind of thing that I guess I don't know I remember when music videos were first getting popular there were a lot of older artists guys like Frank Zappa for example who who you know thought it was a you know the end of whatever I mean people decreed the end of everything at one point or another and okay sure absolutely I guess you know do you think the the videos can sometimes be a distraction from the music or do they pull people deeper into the the world of the band and kind of give them a visual component to kind of latch on to it so it absolutely depends on the director there some people I see a lot of music videos you can tell when when when a director cares about the artists or not you can tell when the director just wants to tell their story and irregardless of who they're working with and they've had treatment sitting around and then their agent connected them with the bands and they just did that and then you can tell when when a director care fix or at least has the ability to describe themselves to what it is they're doing and take into consideration the artists image and actually create an immersive experience that gets you close the artist shows you a new side of an artist then then there are bands that I really love like what that that it's a it's a very integral and important piece of a larger puzzle that paints a much broader picture than just a band like like an actual artistic world that people haven't seen it I mean Devo have the entire stage presence and music video work and and they I think they did a lot of it themselves actually or we're heavily involved in it and I really respect that because they're taking music to a theatrical level in a way that gets people excited and have a lot more to sink their teeth into basically so yeah it all depends on who makes it what they're intentionally director yeah it's it's it's just really interesting because it just kind of seems like the deeper we get into the into the internet age it seems like the more forms of art musicians need to be dabbling in in order to kind of stay relevant and I guess kind of keep people enamored with their aura or their style you know it's it's rare that you know you see famous directors oh in order to you know continue being a famous director or have a successful career I need to get into music you know but instead you know you have musicians that need to be featured in music videos they need to be working with stylists you know and sort of keeping a on top of what's the newest and latest thing in fashion and now - absolutely no no I mean yeah that's the thing you have to be you have to have somebody running the Facebook on your Twitter run I think you're gonna be a viable pop commodity but then not necessarily working in that world and don't don't aren't that's familiar with it as maybe someone like Mark Romanek is just in Taylor Swift video know what with that but what is that for the bad blood video or something else I think he did one it was like a dance routine okay there's a lot of gray background stuff who's like here's the artist being simple like just just being who they are but you know it still costs $300,000 and looks good is there anything sort of at that mainstream level right now that music video wise has really caught your attention is sort of or is sort of inspiring you in any kind of way because while I I think you you seem very well-rounded but then again you have this really sort of defined style to your videos so far that seems like you know you're not really pulling it from anything too new or anything you know too far outside of like you're very hardcore and passionate interests it you know it seems to me that you wouldn't necessarily need to be paying attention to the Taylor Swift music video be in order to be doing what you're doing yeah I mean I think I mean Diane would I mentioned earlier I am a big fan of you know I think I think they're brilliant they also just a back bake sort of Don these alter egos is they had some other band before that yeah I knew they were like kind of normal kind of normal people before so I mean but as far as like big pop stuff I mean I mean I was raised on Michael Jackson Madonna mmm you know and I think I'm also really into sort of like the politics of socialization and how how pop culture is used to bring forward various political ideas or or social movements sometimes nefariously sometimes genuinely and I think I do keep tabs on a lot of the a lot of the new stuff to a degree but not not so much where I can name name certain specific things like just sort of try to get a general swath of a trend I think well you just kind of mentioned die Antwoord there and and I love their music videos as well but but to me kind of a a bit of an issue there is that and and there and they're not alone in this I'm not trying to single them out but you did mention them you know item either' definitely an example of a group whose visuals and whose music videos are just way more elaborate and interesting than just the music by itself a lot of the time and again they're not alone in that there are a lot of artists who I think kind of share that that possibility sometimes I think the music video while it can be amazing sometimes it's kind of a bit of a crutch you know maybe the another example would be the band okay go you know I mean all the other yeah for example so yeah exactly a Kennedy but it's certainly enjoyable I'm sorry oh no I guess I guess my question or my point is you know the music video to you is I guess is it disheartening when you kind of see a music video sort of you know surpassing the quality of the music so greatly I guess hello hey I'm here can you hear me oh yeah yeah how did you hear my question or did I believe me no I think it got cut off okay sorry I was I was gonna say do you find it disheartening at all sometimes when you see a music video like the quality of a surpass the quality of the music itself so greatly so obviously we might be seeing some of that happen for me but yeah I mean I definitely I definitely can't think of anything besides my life that would that happened cuz but I also haven't been watching enough enough pop videos well I think what's interesting is that um music video directors like you and not to say this has anything you know the you guys are certainly not to blame you're sort of in the midst of a music industry that you didn't create but what I think it's sort of on sort of interesting is that when the music sometimes is maybe mediocre or maybe a little middle-of-the-road sometimes it ends up being you guys that sort of save the day when someone comes through with an amazing music video or an amazing music video concept that actually makes you know the song go viral on a platform like YouTube yeah because a lot of the time I mean you know there are a lot of bands that I love and I think are fantastic but the thing is these days if they don't have a music video sort of backing up one of their at least one or two of their singles like their record is essentially kind of dead in the water yeah yeah I mean it's a visual culture I mean especially this new generation that I mean we're talking about kids who are their primary modes of communication or like one sentence one sentence tweets or like maybe three five-second binds and and they they have they deal in the immediate and music videos are far more immediately consumable than say going out of your way to read a review of an album and then and then listening to it and maybe listening to it you know a single or two I mean that's really the way you reach people image is a huge factor and well if I'm talking to a good band or like we're in talks about maybe working together and then they get back to me and tell me their label oh well they don't want to do a music video this time around they want to put it all in PR or YouTube ads or anything like that I think to myself you know that's a that's a waste of money if you don't have something to show because that's your right that's how people grab onto something that they might not have heard of before oftentimes even without MTV so as of right now is there a you know any sort of genre or artist or I guess you know music video style you don't see yourself taking two very well I mean if you had to I don't know sort of come through the music video that was sort of purely promotional or or if you had to do a music video I don't know what if you had to do a rap video or something you know would you feel sort of you know out of your element in those contexts that's a great yeah I don't know I think I think one of the things I love doing more than anything's wrapping my head around something I've never done so boring the answer is no I definitely I wouldn't probably have some I mean if I was given like a mentioned Taylor Swift earlier I mean that would be insane as long as they let me do whatever I want which they wouldn't a lot of fun with that the pipe dream is to do a Taylor Swift video where you're just allowed to do anything that you want yes yes and and and just stirred it off the off the top of your head because I'm pretty sure some of Taylor Swift's PR people they listen to this podcast what what is the concept that you would instantaneously go into if somebody handed you that dream project I would probably get heavily into the whole like pop star mind-control thread you know that's there's like a lot of internet conspiracy theories around this stuff but oh wow and I think I think to have fun with a lot of that sort of Illuminati symbolism and like monarch projects excellent type stuff would be would be a blast mmm so Taylor Swift would essentially be mind controlling her fans yeah essentially she you know she'd be like disseminating some new political platform or like maybe she's wearing certain colors that signify a certain political party or you know I mean any there's any any number of ways you can slip things like that because like you know I love reading there's insane internet like some dark room in Wichita or some guys breaking down like the Illuminati symbolism like Donna video or you know just just putting those Easter eggs everywhere and J would be a real blast well that's really interesting I was just doing an interview with somebody who is a producer a songwriter goes by the name of Clarence clarity he has a new record that came out earlier sure no now and it's a very digital sort of internet era sort of record and a big point of inspiration for him he says was kind of the overwhelming feeling that you get kind of in the Information Age and you know he said he says one of his favorite hobbies on the internet is to you know look into Internet sort of Illuminati conspiracy theories yeah so it's interesting that that's kind of a a bit of a point of interest for you as well a lot of literature there a cult and cults relation to power and and I think getting into that stuff modern context those sites are insane and they just go on forever and ever and there sir I mean there's better movie plots on those websites than anyone's writing in Hollywood absolutely yeah absolutely I mean being from Connecticut myself I've seen lots of theories about Sandy Hook being a hoax yeah which is is pretty uh pretty crazy I mean one one video in particular where the guy went as far as to look at helicopter video of the parking lot where police had been parked and so on and so forth you know that the the parking lot that was regularly used during the school day by teachers and faculty and pointed out that in the parking lot itself that there were no oil stains in any of the parking space and this so that must be because the whole parking lot in school was built just to stage this event the whole thing was a set yes which again does not explain everybody in the town sort of not you know sort of seeing this school just kind of being there unused for years and years and years and years and then nobody coming forward to say that but whatever yeah obviously oh don't pay for it's just a it's just a way to get cheaters new new flavor off the ground probably mm would that be the the eventual twist to the end of the Taylor Swift music video it would all just be one kind of big Cheetos commercial yeah yeah you know which think which I mean they could use some some new PR I haven't heard much from them recently so you know subway could really use some new PR so I run you really be doing them a favor if you did something if you did some kind of work for them you know they've got a covered man their slogan fresh couldn't have been more apropos when should it fan their you know do them a favor throw them a bone in the next I don't know what music video for whatever death metal band you're working with you know just throw in a subway logo in there for a split second just to you know just sort of flash it and sort of bury it into the back of the minds of everybody oh yeah oh yeah no just the you know big before pictures of the singer at like 350 pop yeah I know I actually have slipped a number of one there to frame things into my work and it's imperceptible but it's there so uh okay so you know these videos the dark imagery the Illuminati symbolism let's go into sort of what you were doing on the behemoth video and that goes to video recently because sort of talking about that whole loominatee thing I mean a lot of the themes that you did on both of those music videos direct especially the ghost video directly pull from the occult oh yeah you know did you have to do a lot of research into that in order to sort of execute that into the video or to sort of you know your your YouTube doctorate in those in those fields sort of just allowed you to dabble in the way that you did yeah I mean many years spent reading books like that websites like that I love that stuff and it certainly steering the the direction in the future the films I want to make but hopefully but ya know yeah they were both they're both very entrenched naturally just because those symbols are so I'm so I'm very familiar with all a decent amount of reading on subjects related to that so so it comes naturally at this point I guess the ghost the ghost video was kind of a pretty pretty obvious combination of like sort of like the the conflicts between like the aim ran sort of Fountainhead mentality and via and the sort of like working-class proletariat attitudes you would see in films like metropolis mmm and and the rest was kind of there was a lot of Masonic stuff in there that was a combination of the members of ghosts interests in my own to sort of add all these elements to it maybe comes naturally for sure did you get an opportunity to work really closely with the band and doing that video um I mean they stayed in Sweden and we get a email you back breath initially they they had some vague ideas about bidding they wanted an origin story firm worth for the main character okay it's for the new incarnation and we just kind of bounced back and forth and so we had a sort of loose narrative in the night and then I made a concrete so yeah I mean it was kind of a it was a collaborative that person coming up with the idea and then for execution I think you know I never met them I'm gonna meet them Sunday Ashley we we had a film crew love that great job film in Sweden okay so uh I mean there's obviously that conceptual element to the video there's that element to the video where you do sort of you know see those elements that are obviously directly tied to ghosts and were shot by that crew that was hired but there's out that there's also a lot of clips from the video that seem like they're from other places yeah I don't know we weird occult instructional videos they kind of look like yeah in there no the Masonic ritual stuff is from the film called forces called Frisch's - called forces of what forces occult with an S at the end of both words okay and it's 1943 and it's uh it's a you know it's around that you know the Nazis would be gonna occupy and France and so you have this film that's essentially condemning both the nuts the both the Masons and the Jews is a sort of collaborative effort to control financial financial structure so this is like Nazi propaganda yeah it was yeah oh but but the plus side is that it it flashed out from start to finish an entire Masonic initiation ritual uh so and you can see that in varying degrees on YouTube it's it's fun to skip to those parts as the bestest not that interesting but the other one was uh you see very little of this one silent French hardcore pornographic satanic film called messing war which is funny coincidence there but that's also in there and then abscess will be the mills Madame safe is a great Deco film 1930 and that's like you know that's that's a very very stylized with some great dance numbers in it that essentially feature a big big soiree masquerade on a Zeppelin which you know this forms on well the choreography is killer yeah well that's kind of another element of what you do where the whole than the new come together I mean you know you you do have this original storyline coming through but you've built it together through kind of samples in a way and kind of recontextualizing something old which is you know certainly something the Internet age loves to do yeah it was a fun thing to do and it happens very organic so we're piecing together that puzzles from things I loved something new and it was just kind of it was all destiny because they needed it done very quickly so there wasn't gonna be much time to shoot something new a sign up from just the band member himself so yeah it was not a necessity but it but I was very happy with the result all right man I want to thank you for coming on the show and just kind of again giving us your opinion on sort of music videos in general and just letting us in on some of these projects and what you did with them and some of the concepts on them and you know just just all the information you brought to the table Anthony thanks so much for having me man I love what you do keep it up hit me up next time you drop a video man I will "
5tkJ1fjgmSI,tttt oh hi everyone Fetty WAP tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new album Sun coming down ah tis a post-punk and art punk band who since they released their full-length debut our constellation records not too long ago bitches have not stopped making noise they happy once more with feeling EP released shortly after that full-length album and now just like a year later they are here with this sophomore full-length follow up I like their debut record a lot but I had some reservations with it I like that had a lot of energy it seemed neurotic on edge kind of eccentric and jittery but simultaneously the record also kind of felt like a bit of a junk pile of influences from the fringes of punk and experimental rock in the late 70s and the early 80s it didn't really sound that distinct kind of nondescript however it wouldn't be the first time a band sort of took a record or two to kind of come into their own and develop their own sound and style it certainly sounded like aught was well on their way to doing that wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt they had typed performances on this record some decent instrumentals a good recording and at least assist us to a pocket full of personality and I also like that once again we were getting a band that was putting abstract verbal imagery and lyrics at the forefront of their songs even if they were drowning in their influences a little bit like wire and talking heads and television maybe suicide and some Patti Smith they remind me a bit of MX 80 sound like their old stuff in a way the vocal delivery of Tim Beeler Darcy certainly seems to be a selling point for ought a lot of the time and that's the case for this new record as well they seem to be reaching a higher points of weirdness than they were on the debut record I think and if you're looking for them there are definitely lyrical highlights all over this record moments like this is the high point of civilization or did you say there's a chance of bringing this whole down and that was met for miles that was met for miles that was meant for miles how's the family how's the family how's the family how's the family this is kind of the herky-jerky left-field wordy art rock that is usually in my wheelhouse and yeah it just continues to be the case for this new record over here however I will say the some of Tim's best moments and some of the best lyrics on this record are slightly drowned out by the kind of cacophonous instrumentation which does make the album feel sort of lively it's just a bit of a double-edged sword my final thought tim's vocals is that i just wish he would come off a little more unhinged as he seems to be kind of implying he is through his lyrics and his performances he certainly seems to be a little bolder than he was on the band's last album i'm definitely seeing progression here i think he just could have been more volatile on the performance side of things on this record though that's not to say i'm not enjoying what he's doing already i certainly am a lot of the time on this LP tim reads to me like a cyborg or like an alien who is trying to figure out human emotions and strangely enough on the song passionate turn he comes off sort of passionate and emotional in his own weird way and i love the way the guitars and the drums on this track sort of pasted themselves very carefully to the tempo of his weird lyrical mannerisms the music feels so fluid and so organic and so off-the-cuff and it's just tiptoeing in step just so perfectly in sync with what a lot of tim is doing they just feel so interlocked together once again on this LP just like with Ott's last album a lot of the instrumentals here just feel like these fluid art rock and post-punk e jams with subtle little embellishments coming from the bass and the drums and the keyboards to just add a little bit of color as the band progresses along on a lot of these repetitive grooves and one thing that's kind of refreshing about this LP is that there's a pretty awesome transitions in the midst of these tracks - that worked so much there on Ott's debut i love the bridge and sort of the outro transition on the song men for miles which I thought was really beautiful the opening of the song the combo is super intense and explosive and I love the really dreary and sinister melodies on the second half of the title track here which sounds entirely different from what's going on in the first half of the track which is kind of this weird psychedelic wall of noisy cacophonous rock music which is another moment on the LP I'm not completely sold on I think that not all the beauty of this moment on the record translates because I think it drowns itself out more than it I guess hmmm I don't know really sells itself or or comes through in a clear fashion but still I like that the recording on this album feels so in the moment and feel so raw it's rare that you're getting a great rock recording these days that feels that way that isn't like a demo or something like that I mean everything is just so flawless and quantized these days it's nice hear something that's just a little looser and then there's the track beautiful blue sky one of my favorite cuts on the entire LP not only because I think it gets kind of funny here but I think they're kind of just taking a jab at societal norms at this point with the lyrics and maybe lampooning social pleasantries like I was referencing earlier when I was talking about some of the lyrics where we get these repetitive greetings over and over and over in the lyrics beautiful weather today beautiful weds of the day beautiful weds of the day and there's this kind of jerky somewhat off-kilter groove and some really sharp twangy guitars being played in the instrumental here that remind me a lot of women it didn't really dawn on me just how much of a point of inspiration that band seems to have been for aught until I heard this track where it it feels like this instrumental could have been soaked in more reverb and landed on women's public strain the song celebration was okay I thought this was one of the few moments on the record where the band neglects structure a little bit and it leaves the song feeling kind of like a jumble and just not that cohesive I feel like I'm getting a bunch of different parts that don't really complement each other that well and and for the most part I think the bands avoidance of just usual just normal pop song structures turns out good for them on these tracks it makes the songs just winding and unpredictable and kind of surprising but I think it keeps a few of the tracks on here from having the impact that they could especially with the closing track which seems to just Peter out out of nowhere however I still like the closer on here overall I think it's an example of how the band can just jump from one idea to the next and each idea is so potent that it still makes for a pretty entertaining song and that's pretty much the record it's a succinct 8 tracks which I think was a good move it's kind of a difficult album and and this sort of sound I think could overstay its welcome very easily and in some respects I think this record is an improvement on art's last full-length album but I still think they're just like a smidge short of being a total package of sorts and on first glance I think their music kind of comes off a little pretentious and bloated and masturbatory but if you actually listen just beyond that I think they have a lot to offer I think the band does a great job of scratching that abstract itch while staying really visceral and exciting and kind of hard-hitting and and funny on some of these tracks it's some very intriguing poetry rock and I think I will leave it at that I'm feeling a strong 7 to light 8 on this thing on a good day on a good day could grow on me could grow on me and yeah that's about it transition have you given this record of listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Phan 1000 forever 
VqPV3WIfrhU,six to the gatineau here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Drake and future collaborative album slash mixtape thing what a time to be alive wow what a time to be alive okay so this is a collaborative record between two of the biggest stars in hip-hop music right now we have the Canadian rap King champagne poppy himself the six God and ATL trap balladeer and auto-tune addict future both of whom are fresh off of some of their biggest most successful releases yet Drake with if you're reading this it's too late even I was impressed with this thing and I'm not even really that big of a Drake fan and apparently a lot of other people were too because this thing recently went platinum I thought the minimal approach to the beats on this thing was really refreshing some of Drake's best and most clever and funny and entertaining lines and lyrics I think it end up on this record as well as hooks and sort of refrains even if some of them were ghost written as Meek Mill pointed out earlier this year as he tried to start a a Twitter beef with Drake in which Meek is the one that ended up with egg on his face which is so ridiculous and sort of goes to show how at this very moment Drake is so at the peak of his game he's so untouchable that people can just literally expose him and like nobody cares there's still like a really big fan of him to the point where he doesn't really need to be doing a full-length album collaboration with any other artists out there right now but yeah he is anyway and future I mean he is doing good you can't really deny it I mean I didn't really care for his last full-length album that much I thought it was decent dirty sprite - I think the sound of this record was really great definitely the best sounding project he's pulled out in a while really dark moody intoxicating kind of psychedelic I liked a lot of the beats on this thing but lyrically and vocally I found future to be kind of one-dimensional on this project by the halfway point of the record future has pretty much done everything that he's going to be doing for the rest of the record he's a little bit of a one-trick pony but future does have a strong and very recognizable sound he's pretty catchy and we do love a a good strong trendy trend in hip-hop and not to sound down on the whole thing because there is actually huge explosive potential in a Drake and future collaboration future has a really distinct sound he can be really catchy if he has a hook behind him Drake I think has a better grasp of melody than future does which could lead to some more melodic and some sweeter sounding less redundant songs and Drake is a strong lyricist at least when he's writing his own lyrics or at least he has good taste in lyrics when other people are writing them for him you can give him that much you can give him that much and we have Metro boomin producing on this thing a lot of the beats if not all the beats and that means potential for beggars and that's essentially what we get here we get foul grainy but also pretty well groomed pretty and refined melodic bangers in a way similar to dirty sprite - but a little bit harder and also in a way similar to what Travis Scott was doing outro do not too long ago taking this Atlanta sound and just making it a little bit more artsy and melodic and dreary and intoxicating - but future already had a lot of that going for himself on dirty sprite - just by himself with that one Drake feature on the record and there are at least a handful of cuts on this pretty short project 11 tracks which sound like they could have been cuts off of dirty sprite - there's being reanimated to appear on this project and Drake is being added into the equation to add a few extra vocal melodies or some lyrics sort of like with the track I'm the plug which sounds a lot like in my opinion I serve the base from futures last project digital - and the song live from the gutter - and I don't necessarily think this is the worst thing in the world I liked a lot of the tracks off of ds2 and Drake's appearances on these tracks make things a little more entertaining and lively and a little more engaging and I think Metro boomin instrumentals go a little harder on this project than they did on ds2 for the most part again it's not bad but it doesn't keep this tape from feeling very quickly thrown together especially with a lot of these tracks just being at a very tight concise three minutes or so and sometimes the songwriting on these tracks can feel pretty out to lunch like on on the plug or on the track change locations to where everything lyrically vocally feels really just off the top but when Drake and future do click and there is a spark there and there is electricity there and there's a good tune and there's just a hard banging instrumental we get tracks off of this thing that will work really well in that Club context that Drake and future are known for working in so well DJ's can just kill two birds with one stone and instead of just playing a future song or a Drake song play play both at the same time whoa tracks I think that would work well and and I love this thing our big rings I think Drake's introduction in his lyrics on this track even though they're simple I think they're hilarious and diamonds dancing I think is one of the best tracks that Drake and future has done in a while this track is not only hard-hitting and explosive but it's really moody and beautiful - I like the vocal melodies on this thing and Metro boomin x' beat on here is absolutely gorgeous I think if this project could just be boiled down to one single song keep this same artwork and just make it a single four diamonds dancing and you've got just like one of the coolest hits of the year and as Drake and future sing together in unison on this track it goes over better than expected the song Scholarships isn't bad and the track plastic banks isn't too bad either a bit of a strip club anthem where Drake and future are constantly just trading places on the track on the same melodic line things kind of unravel a little bit toward the end of the the project the song Jersey really does feel kind of like a DS to throw away there's no Drake on it whatsoever and the thirty four thirty freestyle has no future on it I guess they each get their own little solo track and thirty four thirty wasn't too bad I mean I guess it's intriguing if you're a hardcore Drake fan and you kind of want to hear a bit of a mental update from Drake with everything that's good and kind of going through his head since the release of if you're reading this is too late Drake addresses just a lot of haters and people trying to take him down and a little bit of the ghost writing just sort of you know authenticity just real lyricist rapper type stuff that's been getting thrown at him since the Meek Mill beef overall I thought this project was okay a few tracks were decent a handful were great some of them could have gotten thrown into the recycle bin it just feels like a little bit of a compilation nothing too big or significant dent and it's because it's not really that ambitious of a project Drake and future kind of going to each track with almost the same sound and the same aesthetic and the same vibe some of the tracks are harder some of them are a little softer and they just kind of give us a hit here a hit there some misses it's just a little all over the place it doesn't seem like their intentions going into it or that big and as a result I don't think it came out as great as it possibly could have been because Drake and future right now they're at the top of their games and I guess what's kind of sad is that the potential in them collaborating wasn't really fully explored we just kind of got some short enjoyable tracks I'm feeling a light decent six on this thing transition have you given this record a listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it ladies and gentlemen Anthony Fantana Drake future forever ladies and gentlemen Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and what you see on your screen right now is a screenshot from our brand new web site that we launched a little earlier this year it was built by the good people over at Squarespace and I'm here to tell you that there are two links in the description box one link where you can build your own site via Squarespace for your home business for your personal hobby a little passion project whatever added count using a certain URL that we have put in the trypsin box and also there is a link to a playlist we've done a noise rock playlist so if you want to get in a noise rock sort of learn the noise rock ropes a little bit both records new and old classics and newbies then check out that playlist and that's it have a good one love you bye 
VeJkVOFZfsk,fiscally couldn't serve tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Lana Del Rey record honeymoon Lana Del Rey is a California singer who has been at it for a little while now this is a third full-length album she's dropped since she broke a handful of years ago with that really big youtube single and the road to her big breakout album was kind of rocky people clowned her people dug up her old album her old stage name her old face it was not a good look she had some kind of rocky live performances as well and her album didn't really sit well with a lot of the music critics that were so eager to champion her and kind of fuel the fire of her hype leading up to the record however at this point Lana didn't really need the support of these people to keep herself going she found a much larger a much more mainstream a a sort of pop centric audience after some of her singles really went big collaborated with a myriad of different artists now me personally I didn't really like born to die either though I will give it to the record it did have a kind of interesting blend of baroque pop as well as hip-hop music and kind of this vintage vocal pop style kind of playing like a little bit of musical aesthetic dress-up which I suppose is one of the many things I haven't cared for in Lana's music thus far I also don't really enjoy the trashy lyrics the kind of lifeless very just dejected singing and the constant rehashing of pretty much the same story naive girl who's very innocent but only kind of innocent she's got a morbid kind of a naughty curiosity meets bad boy a lot of the same stuff got repeated under her follow-up album ultraviolence sans a lot of the hip-hop influences and sort of backed up with some bigger more extravagant more expensive Instrumentation I didn't really care for this one either so going into her latest full-length album over here I wasn't really expecting much especially based off of the singles that teased up to this record the title track of this thing I thought was alright I appreciated it as I guess an experiment in subtlety for Lana the instrumentation sounded very nice and very pleasant and sort of dramatic very old school again borrowing heavily from that 50s and 60s vocal pop and baroque pop sound although I just thought her vocals were just kind of meh and the track hi by the beach I was kind of stunned by stunned by just how bad this track was I really think it's one of Lana's worst songs I mean the instrumental on this track to me is completely throwaway and to me shows that that the Lana and her producers aren't even trying to keep up the lavish extravagant or of instrumentation that surrounds her that keeps her shtick believable in the first place but I will say I think that this record has some of Lana's best songs yet on it she is still very much the same artist for the most part but she's starting to really woo me a little bit with some of the finer details on this record which might have a lot to do with her sticking with about two producers or so for the duration of this album wears on ultraviolence it was really overloaded with a lot of musical input coming from a lot of different participants collaborators the instrumentation on this LP doesn't really feel to synthetic like it did on born to die it doesn't feel overdone like it did on ultraviolence it's kind of a happy middle ground it feels very organic the acoustic guitars the strings the pianos the drums they all sound very natural and a lot of blends into the instrumentation really nicely on a lot of the tracks that kick this record off and the vocals a lot of singing on this thing there are noticeably less flubs and just kind of weird off-pitch notes and kind of you know croaked notes on this record she seems to be doing a better job of singing as far as just keeping pitch there are some moments on this record like on the track God knows I tried where I would call her singing emotional emotional and I think there are a lot of tracks on this record that have a good song at the foundation of them like you could apply this song to a lot of different musical contexts and it would still be a good song like there's a good melodic character to some of these tracks like music to watch boys to I love the alluring woodwind melody that kicks this track off it's fantastic making the track feel so smoky so eerie dare I say sexy I like the saxophone on the track Art Deco really nice touch I like it's kind of stuttering melody the tune at the core of religion is really nice too one of Lana's better choruses yo my religion and I like the tune at the core of the track 24 as well again some of Lana's best tunes of her career land on this record however I wouldn't say that the lyrics are amazing I don't think Lana's turned a new lyric Alief there are plenty of a trashy lyrical moments on this record like on the song freak which i think is maybe the worst track in the whole bunch here where again not only is Lana just fetishizing the idea of coming out to the west coast and getting freaky getting druggie but also there are some weird vocal embellishments on this track which is it did not go over well and and what is that one line just your sister stranger than a stranger okay the line of the first four songs on this record I actually enjoyed quite a bit but this record starts to lose me right after these first several tracks having said that I will give high by the beach a little bit of credit though there is an interesting lyrical moment on this track that I missed in my initial listens to the song where she is saying that just because you're a bad that don't make you a man and the truth is I never bought into your which totally reverses the whole naive dumb just idiot party girl sort of persona that she's put into her music countless times prior to this record and it's like whoa Lana is is like capable of singing about other topics and other situations there are themes of just lust and betrayal on this album not just you know some kind of Little Red Riding Hood type getting lured by the big bad wolf and I think my final issue with the album though is while I think there are some of Lana's best tunes on this album I think she still has a little ways to go in order to become an entertaining electrifying really passionate singer because even though I like a lot of the tunes on this record as the album draws on Lana's very limited vocal range and emotional range starts to show especially on the last track on this album which is a cover one of my favorite singles of all time don't let me be misunderstood where Lana once again has kind of grown very very cold to the point where the tracks original beauty and original fire and passion is just like nowhere to be found and Lana isn't really that tightly in sync with her backing instrumentation it's a super clumsy cover that I just wish did not make the cut and the instrumental on the interlude of this album kind of feels like some strange new-age music being sampled and looped as if I was listening to a vapor wave tune or something and then Lana comes out of nowhere delivering this TS Eliot poem and are we buying this are we buying this I'm torn on this Lana album so my favorite a lot of tracks on here and some tracks that I really don't care for at all though I think maybe are slightly more bearable than some of her worst moments on born to die I think this is her most likeable project so far but I just barely liked it I think overall when I take into account the songs on here that I love and think are great the tracks toward the back end where she really loses me the song is in the middle of the record where she gets super trashy and super difficult to tolerate the don't let me be misunderstood cover on here I mean these are the lows for me on the record which kind of balance out a little bit with the highs of which there are quite a few as well all in all I am indifferent on the record overall but I mean the tracks that I do think were really good like 24 like religion at least give me a bit of hope for Lana's future and I think will lead to me feeling maybe just a little less cynical when I do go into listening to a new Lana Del Ray song I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition have you given this record to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Lana Del Rey forever 
dTf9UyRFMI8,a hi everyone sofa nice tres Sano here the Internet's busiest music nerd having a little trouble at the moment because my computer's broken my desktop is broken so I'm not able to edit on that however we have our best people on the case we will be back up and running as usual very very soon it's time for review of the new Mac Miller record good a.m. Mac Miller is a Pittsburgh rapper who's been at it for a while now somebody who I kind of got turned on to back in 2011 when he broke with his big donald trump single a song that i am very disappointed is not being played more regularly on the Trump campaign trail and when you think about when that single came out wasn't really that long ago but I feel like Mac Miller has dropped so much music between now and then and evolved quite a bit too from his young silly fun-loving pop rapper phase to a series of Records where he kind of portrays this gloomy dejected monotone stoner rapper and we also have delusional Thomas and Larry fisherman and whatever he thought he was doing with that Larry loves teen project and a good mix of all of this stuff comes together on Mac Miller's latest record right here good a.m. and there's actually a series of cuts on here that are pretty upbeat some of the most concisely written singles Mac Miller has written in a very long time since his early days when he was just writing poppier stuff a great deal of these tracks were teased ahead of this album as singles tracks like brand name or hundred grandkids or break the law I love the song When in Rome too which is just a really tight trap flavored banger there's a lot of very hyped songs in this tracklist wasn't really expecting that considering how I guess one note and just very low-key some of Mac's recent projects have been like watching movies with the sound off and faces in some ways it's like a brand new Mac Miller but another way he's very much the same dude Mac's lyrical content is sexual its druggie it's funny very tongue-in-cheek a lot of the time occasionally his lyrics come off really personal or even revealing and I'm actually spotting some more examples on this album where lyrically Mac is sounding a pretty clever like on break the law or on the track two matches or on the song time flies little B there's just too many tracks to name where I think Mac Miller is doing a better job of kind of explaining himself lyrically in giving his own walk of life just a little bit more depth and this is all good this is all good stuff I take these tracks over the monotone unenthusiastic Mac Miller any day however he shows up on a lot of these cuts to like on the song clubhouse or on the track rush hour where we have just a very special line about Chris Tucker I will say though that there are some moments on this album where Mac kind of translates his usual just malaise into a pretty good tune like on the song weekend with Miguel the the instrumentation on this track is layered really beautifully it's a sweet song so while I do prefer the more upbeat side of this record even some of these tracks have their questionable moments to like on the song in the bag where the refrain on this track is like this is the music that makes white people mad you wish I actually think white people like this this music quit quite a bit and there's also kind of the drug dealer talk on the song break the law which I understand is metaphorical and might have actually been sort of possibly placed there by schoolboy q who apparently had like a hand in writing this song and many other tracks on the record which isn't too hard to believe considering that I think there are a few bars here that have a I think some cue ish moments like on the song perfect circle where Mac kind of has a little quirk or egos giving y'all the freebase feels like something right off of oxymoron though I will say the seven minute tract is one of my favorite moments on the entire LP even though it is more low-key Mac does a pretty great job of really translating his emotions on this song the verses here don't kind of feel like the usual board or happy-go-lucky filler that Mac Miller puts into a lot of his tracks it really seems like he is feeling every single word coming out of his mouth because there's a seriously personal edge to this song especially in the second half where he kind of transitions from this very sad lonely drug-addled youth to somebody who is going to I guess kind of just fight harder for himself and his success and his future even the songs on this record that feature Mac Miller singing go over much better than any songs where he was singing on his previous records while I wouldn't say they're some of my favorites here they certainly come off Pleasant rather than horrible sort of like on the song our OS the melodies the vocals here they sound very nice they're very sweet even though lyrically this track is just kind of like a pandering sort of love song and when Mac goes off on the song When in Rome and he's saying that he's at the top of his game I really can't disagree I think in a lot of ways this is the best project he's pulled together so far however do I find Mac Miller to be this really exciting personality who I just hang on his every word not really but you know I can definitely recognize that he's made a lot of improvements on this project I will say I think this record really overstays its welcome and while Mac Miller does bring more variety to the table here it's not like he has brought so much that it justifies the length of this album I think there are a few misused features in the track listing here Miguel while I do appreciate his vocals and may and maybe some of the music he brought to the track where he appeared his presence seems very faint and then little B who I mean I I thought he was going to just do something a little bigger or a little bit more significant on the track he just kind of provides I guess this really Spacey verbiage that I guess is supposed to be motivational in the way that little B lyrics or just his Twitter account is supposed to be kind of motivational sort of in the middle of the song and I think it interrupts and kind of kills the momentum of the track more than it helps it along chief Keef's feature on this record was definitely more interesting in name than it was in execution and little dragon while for the most part I liked little dragon and I think the synthetic instrumental on this album is really nice I just didn't really care for how sleepy the closure of this album was in general I guess it was just kind of a weird placement and I guess that kind of leads me into the final moments of this record which I think are nowhere near as strong as the first half of the album in the last three tracks to this LP it's like Mac Miller just really wanted to bring the momentum and the energy down really quickly I mean the energy really takes a nosedive on this record suddenly especially after the incredibly aggressive track that featured chief keef ascension was okay to me the song jump was really unbearable it just seemed like Mac Miller was really just starting to test the boundaries of his singing voice on this track and it just sounded a little too uh I guess fruity for me a little and again I did like that little dragon instrumental but I just don't know if this I guess synthetic sort of beat that has a very strong dance vibe to it is exactly the type of instrumental pallet that I see Mac Miller working really well on generally on the rest of the album the production is great it's jazzy its quirky its colorful its Spacey its kind of psychedelic a little moody a little sad again the beats are great and I think absol had the best feature on the entire album I will say that before I go into my final thoughts on this LP I think Mac Miller came through a lot of positives on this record I think lyrically he has improved and he's become more interesting as a person at least when it comes to what he says in his songs I think he's given himself a lot more depth and description he doesn't seem like this white stoner slacker stereotype anymore and I think he's given his depression his moodiness his sadness a bit of weight that makes it really believable and relatable I don't directly relate to Mac Miller's I guess life story and life path the lyrics he puts on this album certainly make sympathizing with him and understanding him way easier I think he has a little bit more maturity going for him on this project which is great having said that I do think this record drag is a little bit I think there are a few tracks that pale in comparison to others here and there and kind of just way down the momentum of the record but still I think good a.m. is a good project and Mac Miller should be proud of this one I think and it sort of makes me actually look forward to what he might be doing in the future as opposed to where I was kind of standing with faces and movies with the sound off where I didn't hate those records but I came away from them sort of indifferent definitely feeling positive on good AM though I think it just has a lot of good things going for it and Mac Miller seems to be coming through with music now that not only feels personal and feels like himself but also has pop appeal and is pretty artistic as well I'm feeling a light too decent 7 on this thing transition have you given this record to listen and if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Mac Miller forever 
0YXDSg3PmzY,oh ho ho boy retha nev utan oh here the internets did the bit and it's time for a review of the new underachievers record evermore the art of duality the underachievers are a brooklyn rap duo this is their second full-length commercial release and they initially broke just about a few years ago with a pretty impressive debut mixtape indigo ism the duo is two members is AG older is a - and a k brought really speedy flows that cut very aggressively through the incredibly mystical beats on this tape it was a little all over the place philosophically I think but maybe my main issue with this thing is that was a little overly long and while I appreciated a lot of the rhetoric put into the lyrics on this record I guess there weren't a whole lot of specifics there were mentions on this tape of you know seeing with your third eye and kind of just engaging in higher planes of thinking but it was all kind of engaged with on this really vague level which was even harder to ignore on the duo's debut commercial project where they kind of did the same thing though I did think some of the underachievers best songs are on this record even though a few of the instrumentals and then the flows on on this thing we're kind of rough however I am happy to report in this review that the underachievers are now starting to take their philosophy and they're applying it to things that are specific not just like abstract and undefined personal struggles with growing up in school and family and just trying to stay on the straight and narrow in the city and also the world at large and the underachievers approach these topics on this new record over your ever more the art of duality and as you can assume from the title this project does really have two sides to it tracks 1 through 7 have a bit more of a positive mindset the instrumentals are a little sweeter a little jazzier a little area and more ethereal the melodies are very sweet and the underachievers lyrically try to sort of point you on the path to goodness but the rest of the album is actually quite dark a lot of very grimy banger instrumentals violent hedonistic lyrics and a strong feeling of negativity too although a lot of this is framed within the underachievers usual sort of philosophical godly spiritual mindset so I do this kind of Sister two-part record with just different faces different sides to it I'm sure there are a lot of reasons if you were to actually get a hold of the duo ask them yourself and there are a lot of things to read into the lyrics but maybe the biggest point illustrated in the lyrics on this record is the power of choice are you doing this thing are you doing that thing are you taking this path are you taking that path are you bettering yourself are you sabotaging yourself in some kind of way that sort of seems to be the the key theme to the song illusions and the first half of the record although there is a vocal of clip in the midst of this song where somebody is sort of going on and on about how choices is nothing but in illusion how there's really no such thing as control and we're all products of everything that's occurred to us up until this point things get kind of existential on this project but still the underachievers seem to espouse this idea that you have at least some kind of control over your life maybe that's a part of the overall theme of duality the idea that we have choice we have control but simultaneously the idea that we don't it's a lot of hippy but it's also really sweet entertaining and motivational too there are quite a few moments especially when he's sort of delivering these more positive lyrics especially the more personal ones where he's sort of delving back into his past reminds me a little bit of k RS one except the underachievers have a totally different flow style and their instrumentals are way more psychedelic now as I was saying earlier the instrumental character of the first half of this record is far different than that of the second half the first half of this LP the instrumentals are sweet they're smooth they're melodic I love the very smooth jazz rap vibe of the song the dualist and the intergalactic pianos and bass on the song chasing faith is wonderful too I also like how we kind of get a similar vibe on the song illusions but it's it's even stronger I feel like as I'm listening to this beat'em just traveling through the Milky Way and the song illusions not illusions illusions on the second half of this record is kind of like the dark grimy sister song to this track in the first half so there are some moments or the second half of this record mirrors the first half in some kind of way now the second half of this record hits hard its aggressive this is the point on the album where issah and ak's aggressive flows their speedy flows and also their chemistry together as a duo really pays off because it makes a lot of the songs on the side of the record pretty explosive from the song reincarnation to the track moonshot the underachievers just deliver one banger after another and lyrically I feel like they kind of illustrate the flaws of this dark side and just kind of the personality traits of this dark side of maybe this a very hedonistic selfish kind of violent personality and world and while I think this is not the path that ultimately these two want to go down I don't think they completely reject it either I think the idea of this record is sure you have the options there you have the choices there but simultaneously nobody's entirely good or entirely bad either and the final moments of this record especially the last track I feel like ties these two worlds together and just kind of the the two sides of this album the two sides of this philosophy the duality of this album just brings it all together very nicely not only an instrumental that kind of I think complements both sides of these worlds but a series of verses that sort of do a pretty decent job of explaining the whole theme of this album as a whole even if I do think maybe the the the two songs preceding this track were a little maybe unnecessary I think this record in in in the same way that indigo ISM does to an extent overstays its welcome a little bit and there are a few tracks here and there that maybe end a little too abruptly especially the first two tracks and I'm not in love with every instrumental I thought the instrumental on star signs was a little I don't know I guess disappointing didn't really have that strong of a flavor to it nor do I think it complemented it Suzanne a case flows all that well and that's another thing a lot of the flows these two guys use on this record I don't think there's a flow on this record that I hadn't heard on any other previous projects to the point where sometimes on these songs I'm getting serious like instances of deja vu back to older underachiever songs but that's kind of the end of my complaints with this album a bulk of this 60-minute record is really good and accounts for some of the best material under achievers have put out so far it's awesome to sort of hear music that's actually letting us sort of peek into the mindset of this ax and a K even if what sort of was hiding underneath the the philosophy they were always alluding to on their previous records just kind of amounts to hey you know what just like make some better choices while yeah that might be like a simplistic you know kind of desire or recommendation they certainly make some wonderful and very inspiring music and and and complement it with with very passionate poetry to make that pill very easy to swallow there's certainly a lot of room for improvement still but I think the underachievers have come through with their best projects so far and they're making some of the most thoughtful and entertaining hip-hop to come out of New York right now I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing transition have you given this record of listen if you have what did you think of it you loved it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it right now my desktop has the bed so editing on laptop for now all my presets and all my images and titles and everything are on my desktop so I can't really access them until it's fixed but it's why the reviews are still the reviews oh whatever we're all going to live we're all going to live we're all going to live forever 
UWi3MhcgNEs,hi everyone yeah ethany Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for another vinyl update but in this latest series of vinyl updates and not so much talking about newer LPS and sort of full-length additions to my record collection instead I have been going down to the the the deep dark depths of my vinyl sort of you know the case over here and digging into my 45 and 7-inch collection ho buddy so we are going to continue through that I know too many seven inches you know just a small little collection but doing these videos so reminds me that maybe I should sort of expand the side of my collection a little bit but these are what I got so let's go here is a 7-inch that I actually reviewed on the channel a hardcore punk EP from a band by the name of C R Tay I hope I'm pronouncing their name correctly cool little female fronted hardcore punk act really heavy sound on this thing and yes and a little insert with this thing sort of the you know the some thank yous and the personnel and it's a nice little gray 7-inch sort of purplish a little bit - it's kind of got this greyish quality to it it's like a dark blue avender or something so that's cool yeah so so if you're if you're into that cool into hardcore punk that's loud and noisy I wonder where that band is now are they still rocking it somewhere are they are they still hardcore are they still punk what are they doing let me know I have also a civil civic seven-inch if you're looking for some you know really pumpin fun electronic and rock infused instrumental music then definitely look up this band the b-side of this track is run overdrive the b-side of the single also on the b-side as the song fuck youth oh yeah this is a I remember this is a a double B side which is funny Sam we have fuck youth and we have a run overdrive two very great tracks from civil civic I wonder how those guys are doing when have the civil Civic guys are doing to take it a trip back through memory lane on this thing I'm trying to trying to keep everything organized over here okay there we go now I got it all right here's another 7-inch which has like a story I think I actually got this my aunt had some seven inches hanging around in her collection and I was just kind of you know she was like she doesn't have a record player anymore so I was just like how can I just see what you got in your collection she's like yeah sure she had a lot of you know hit singles from back in the day and when she was younger and I got Phil Collins in the air in the air tonight it's great single great single great pop tune do enjoy some Phil Collins this is uh this is an interesting little 7 inch over here it's it's I guess a I guess a playable flexi disc I suppose is what you would call it it's from the band creative adult and if you're into some post hardcore music and some noise rock look them up and you know comes with quite a bit of I guess sort of art there's a whole booklet here for this for this little flexi disc deal and so yeah there you go these songs are happy our creative adults and no no the the thing I guess itself is called happy hour though on side a it is creative adult and on the b-side is the vibrating antennae with song my name is question so that's a nice sort of addition to the to the thing and this thing plays at 33 and a third sort of so so officially not a 45 but still we like to have fun around here all right here is a couple seven inches I love from a group that I'm somewhat of a big fan of I like a lot of their early output we have cristal stilts if you're looking for some dark psychedelic post-punk II a little gothic sort of garage rock look this band up this song I believe which which one is this this is shake the shackles and magnetic moon love these tracks and this is love is a wave which is probably my favorite single from them of all time and it's white Wow Wow it's white it's white y'all and this I believe is just simple sort of black it's so it's I am really that great of a of a sleeve or pressing just kind of like a simple white label the record itself sounds good but it's just like it's just kind of a paper sort of covering alright moving on we have a 7-inch from the band cub which is kind of like a little indie rock group and I believe that nard whare gave me this 7-inch I think gnar doir gave me this so thank you to NAR doir for giving me the 7-inch I still appreciate it quite a bit as you may or may not know Cub ended up on a compilation that I did a sort of female post-punk bands for NPR music way back in the day and in doing his research nard wire sort of looked at that little playlist I did and he actually picked me up a few records from from some of the artists who were on that label so he really did a nice thing and hooked me up so thank you mr. nard waar the human serviette this next one is a big one this one is also sort of ties into the Nardo our thing because he actually gave me a signed copy of from mr. Jello Biafra himself of the Dead Kennedys my favorite Dead Kennedys record of plastic surgery disasters and here we have Dead Kennedys the original singles collection from Dead Kennedys I bought this box set heard it was coming out for I think a Record Store Day or something and I decided to pick it up and I've played them they sound great so I mean while I did talk about how I was a little disappointed with some of the printing on the covers like you know you could kind of tell that they kind of just took the single itself and printed it on to just like this white background or whatever you know I would be nice if the the art had been treated with a bit more care and authenticity I guess but the 7-inches themselves sound great so you know and you know they sound nice and sort of true to the analogue sound of the of the singles themselves and if you want to get in Dead Kennedys I recommend that you sort of look any of these tracks up they are aggressive they're politically charged there's a lot of satire so you know don't necessarily take all of the song titles of these songs literally like Dead Kennedys kill the poor when my favorite did Kennedy's songs but if you listen to the song please read into the deeper context of the lyrics also uh on the other side what do we have here we have insight song insight on the other side so kill poor and insight and all the labeling and all the seven inches is pretty much the same Dead Kennedys holiday in Cambodia okay great track and also a police truck a song that is way more relevant today than it should be look up the song police truck that song as dark and again wait way too relevant here's another one of my favorites can these tracks too drunk to fuck great song too drunk to fuck it's it's a hard rocker it's a hard rocker it'll make you want to dance and we also have the prey on the other side definitely one of the Dead Kennedys Dead Kennedys darker tracks we also have Nazi Punk's fuck off and I actually have from alternative Tentacles records you know the pressing of that single itself because when Dead Kennedys got off of alternative tentacles they pretty much took the rights to everything with them except for the Nazi Punk's fuck off singles so they were still printing that or maybe they're just had copies left over I don't know and on the other side of this of this track of this 7 inch with the box set is the song dead no it's not dead Dead Kennedys fucking I'm an idiot it's moral majority ok so uh how much are they right what that let's see if it'll let's see yeah I'm gonna sing the song a little bit you guys how's the mode of my job are they because I'll be able to rail well trying to rows our tried aside God must be dead fer a lot really great song a track that you will want to play to the more evangelical people in your lives if you want them to hate you alright so uh we also have a the song bleed for me not one of my favorite did Kennedy singles but I do love the song life sentence it's a life sentence that is a hilarious track actually do I do like that song fuck me so we have Dead Kennedys bleed for me life sentence but I do find life sentence to be a very funny track very entertaining tracks that way in Dead Kennedys Halloween another fantastic single an interesting track sort of about I don't know I guess I want to say just being real to yourself and kind of using Halloween is this time to escape when you could be escaping every day if you are again sort of true to yourself Saturday night Holocaust on the b-side and finally we have Dead Kennedys with it got a badass and man with the dogs on the b-side and this box that actually comes with I actually have not there's like a story here for every single sort of single here to you know just kind of give context for each song and I even read it yet because I'm not I'm a jerk and I think we are going to maybe get into it a few more get into a few more let me pull out a few more let me see how far we can go here do a few more before we call it quits we do have a 7 inch here which was given to me by the band let me get their name here it's a nice pink little 7 inch the DeLoreans still got this one guys thanks for passing it along to me I thought it was a fun little couple of tunes on here and also I do like the sort of fun colorful single art that you guys you guys pulled together a nice little 7 inch package over here looks and feel sort of handmade I sort of wonder how these were produced looks like this is 112 of 150 singles so Wow rare baby rare and we'll do a couple more a couple more we have you see the doors with Brad and end of the night on the b-side and who loved this song love this track over here Neil Diamond Neil Diamond on this on this 7-inch over here which which at some point was 77 cents can't beat that price that's that's less than what you would pay for a single on iTunes these days you'll be a woman soon that's the that's the track on the a side over here that is a great tune look it up and on the b-side you'll forget so yeah that's it we are about halfway through like halfway through right now we got dope body over here with the tracks Saturday and on the no track Saturday uh-uh this is the Saturday EP on the east side his thong leather head and on the b-side was song youthful relic I thought it was decent reviewed it on the channel and this is actually a pretty nice teaser toward what they did on the record lifer a lot of the stuff on here ended up being a pretty chaotic just like on that record and this 7-inch over here comes from a band actually comes from father/daughter records thanks for passing me this 7-inch along I think I might have bought it from them I thought I thought it was a good a nice little single the the the band's name is family trees the song is dream talking okay and I love that track so much I picked up the 7-inch dream talking from father daughter or daughter records and there's like all sorts of inserts here and everything and they all look xeroxed and hand cut and the 7-inch itself I believe is clear if I remember correctly at when I first yeah it is when I first got this thing I played the hell out of it thought it was a nice little tune family trees dream talkin sweet little dreamy tune with some nice harmonized vocals I believe kind of had an old-school vibe to it if I recall correctly yeah so we are about halfway through now a little less than halfway through we'll get there we'll get there I think I could probably close it up and maybe a few more videos but yeah that's that's the 7-inch collection thus far and yeah thanks for watching let me know uh anything let me know anything because I know nothing transition I hope you're having a good day and you know I hope you're chilling relaxin check out some of these artists check out some of these songs if you haven't heard him and um we have a full week reviews coming up so I'll see you on the on the flip side love you bye

Clarence clarity who's come out with one of my favorite I don't know I guess experimental R&B experimental pop records of this year titled no now reviewed it far earlier this year really loved it still jamming it to this day mister clarity thanks for coming on dude thanks i love the way pleasure written this a pool yeah no problem i I just I just really wanted to ask you this question in in recently listening to your new record because every single time I listen to it I just sort of hear new little hidden sonic bits that I didn't catch last time I just want to sort of get out there in the clear so you did you did all the vocals on the record yeah and everything but yeah okay so you did all the production on this record and you wrote all the songs on this record yeah you're a fucking madman dude yeah as a compliment I think yeah it's the only way I sense a bit of work I mean I'm recent only Reese has been trying to get more into collaboration since of so finished the epic piece whatever the hell you want to call the album but like be at that time it just is the only work at work doing everything myself so sure did this your debut record right yeah yeah I mean I've had other projects in the past though you know particularly gone as far as I might like I mean this is the first proper record um yeah I guess like a Sarah Marshall commercial release yeah um you know what sort of possesses you or sort of makes you I guess really pile the tracks on because this thing is an hour long it's 20 tracks and we have you know not only tracks that are kind of in my opinion just like alternative pop bangers but then we've got these like really strange collages and sound scapes that seem like they sample bits of the other songs kind of just weaving it all together yeah yes even the stranger moments seem very obviously connected to the more accessible moments in some way good yeah I mean you seem to be one of the people that really gets it which is which is amazing but a lot of people that I think they just see is this overblown thing for the sake of it it was never really like that I think wouldn't stand necessarily planned for it to be 20 tracks I think I was just trying to get together as much material as I could at one point and you just you know filter it down just into something coherent but there's just one baby I saw when I was getting near work though it was the end and I turned around that's what will this kind of works that it sounds good to me I mean I still edited stuff out there still like you know would be another at least another ten songs are normal over here but yeah it just made it made sense to me and then I think maybe I was about 17 tracks or something like and at that point I said well what does it need and I deliberately sort of honed in on making some new tracks that would make the picture complete and then there's the track in the middle of silent but there's other stuff going on in that that you can't hear and then I just rounded off a nice twenty tracks it just felt so nice that I appreciate you sort of implying that I get this album in some kind of way because because really at the really at the end of day I feel like I don't get any of it well I guess I guess it's the fact that it's so confusing and so intriguing that kind of you know keeps me coming coming back to it you know I just kind of feel like what one thing that I like about this record and that's not only reflected in the track listing that you were talking about but also just the density of a lot of these songs just the the layers and layers and layers of I have samples I'm sure as well as like you know original synthetic you know key voice stuff and your vocal layering it's all just so maximal and it just kind of seems like there there's I mean obviously there is but it just kind of seems like there's no point at which you just say stop you know like okay this song is done it's it kind of seems like these are the sorts of tracks that have like maybe 10 or 15 drafts before we get the actual final version kind of I mean I don't have a demo phase or anything like that so you're just kind of like continually yes working on the same track and this one and it'll just go through various different levels of completion but sure it ID I definitely know when I'm done with the song I know when it feels finished to me I just think why other people's standards that seems to be a lot everything comes across a lot more busy when in my head it will make sense but I mean part of the process I guess in the wire workers in it is quite self-indulgent I'll admit that like I I'd do it for the moment I'm making it and I'm sure that most creative people probably find especially if music or whatever like you do keep adding because you're trying to keep it interesting for yourself and you probably when you don't need to and that that's just other like oh maybe I've stressed about that in the past and be like no no keep it simple I don't know but I think with this music I'll just I'll just go for it and I still know it's dumb so I'll just enjoy it enjoy making it and then then draw a line under when I feel like it to go anywhere else yeah yeah exactly I mean that's how every track sort of feels at least at least a majority of them like there's no room for anything for anything else to have that's just what I think the whole thing was meant to be not in any real specific sense but just a reflection of how I look at life in general I always feel especially the Internet well whatever the hell would become in with the Internet is like it's just intense everything coming at you from all angles and it's just gonna have just a mirror that a bit of thing I I think it also may be unintentionally sort of mirrors that kind of temptation in the modern age for music artists especially self producers like yourself who that temptation always adds something takes something out switch something out is always there because really at the at the end of the day all you're really spending is your own time you know you're you're not you know sort of on somebody else's dime in a really expensive studio that's charging a certain amount of money per hour to do all of this I mean this is this is all sort of at your own leisure yeah and outside of you know context as a band of a band there's no there's no compromise there's no limitations of another musician or something or even your own to some extent anymore but I mean I know I can play a bunch of instruments but if something if I wanted a sax solo or something I'm gonna pull it in from somewhere else and maybe I'll remould it and chop it up into a thousand different bits or whatever but yeah that there are labeling limitations in any sense yes there's no one that we will pull down that rabbit hole okay that banned formula that you were just referring to is that is that something that you've worked in yourself with with other people think a lot to think maybe I don't know exactly how it manifests but maybe that does give me a certain I don't know push me in a slightly different place than maybe a lot of bedroom producers I've just come up like making dubstep or whatever not to speak ill about whatever but like just that headspace where you never know any different like well I'm not so much curious about how it influences you sort of as far as the actual music that we're hearing on the record but is is there something about doing that in your past in your history this sort of pushed you to doing something and more of a solo capacity like do you just get more gratification of you know sort of only working with your own ideas and kind of just pushing yourself to the to the limits that you could push yourself yes probably it's just just the no compromise I guess is where interest it's compromise like a dirty word with you not necessarily I think you know the reason this whole that wrote this record is solid the blown is because I just threw everything into it almost as a bit of an experiment and like if this was just all me what would it sound like that every idea came from my head and including like a lot of the artwork and everything it's just there's one vision especially in the current climate of saying pop music definitely I mean you know there's so many people involved in a pop record now and it's just you don't really know what you're listening to anymore you don't know who did one with this record that is just it's just me and it's not to say but I necessarily have to work like that or work like that moving forward but yeah and they seemed like the right thing to do at the time speaking about pop music I mean while this is a really experimental and a very dense and sort of purposefully overblown record in a lot of ways it is a pop record as well and and even though a lot of these tracks do feel filled to the brim you definitely leave space open for a lot of these hooks and and Mel to breathe you know how do you sort of find that balance between you know really overloading these tracks but also making sure the the songs are kind of readable and and maybe even though I enjoy the record to death maybe they're not as readable as they could be because I remember you know really being put off by the record when I first heard it and maybe sort of being intrigued by the album art but then when I got to my sort of second third listened through kind of just all the the noise was clearing for me in my head and I was finally sort of translating the album to myself so even though it was a little difficult at first the songs are certainly still there and and and and they're very audible yeah I mean for me is I mean structurally I think most of the songs are just first chorus arrangements there's nothing particularly clever going on that's deliberate I mean I think I wanted to keep some things simple and straightforward to hopefully allow enough room for the more interesting ideas or you know other that experimental maybe I guess I don't know I guess in the process of recording and from a technical standpoint I might build a track up per vocal in and then start taking stuff away to sort of make room for it it becomes a bit of a sort of ice sculpture that I'm chipping away at and till it becomes something recognizable was hopefully something digestible you know I think what you were saying there with the pop song structures really makes a lot of sense because with everything on this record being so dense and really difficult it kind of seems like you've got to stick to at least this one simple idea also we're just all yeah it would really be no stop to any other well I did I did try and have a fair consistence of palette sound and it might have been quite a big palette I did start out with some rules and deliberate limitations I've wanted to set for myself because I knew that when I get in the zone I go off on one but I had to sort of have these a few walls most of the drum sounds the same there's not that many example like this reoccurring sore harps and synths and I don't know I feel like it might not come across and you know the first person and I can't really expect it to but maybe it's all metal and subliminal metal but over a few lessons it should feel like you're always in the same world even if it is busy and it's intense you're in the same nightmare so it becomes a familiar nightmare then maybe you know it's alright it's just another night dreaming it yeah I mean I would say that's that's a really accurate description because I mean I I can't say that there's any one or two particular sounds that even in all of my lessons to the record that I'm like oh that's the same exact sound I heard you know several tracks earlier but subliminally yeah it does all kind of read as being from the same strange place and then with the last track kind of you know sounding like as if it's just a reference to the first track that is loops right is started and it just kind of seems like and it just kind of seems like the nightmare is just just ever going like if you wanted to you could just loop this album forever yeah I think it's just meant a bit bit well that you can interpret on a few like this but almost like this Groundhog Day style just constant repetition of life in general or you know you could you could get bit more fancy in reincarnation and all that kind of thing and I did try and have a few sort of elements of that and maybe some lyrical themes and satellite but yeah and I mean just the idea of infinity infinitely inspires me so yeah I felt quite quite right to somehow weave that into the the almost literal soft fabric of the record are you okay so you know we're talking about a lot of sonic themes on the record you kind of reference the lyrical themes on the record which is maybe the most confusing and unknown realm to me of this record I mean I find myself singing along to a lot of the songs but you know do I have any sort of you know like even semblance of an idea as to what I'm singing along to really I don't really I have no idea like what are we trying to say with cancer in the water I'm not sure you know are we is is it something incredibly abstract or are we literally talking about the populace being poisoned with water are we talking like some some tinfoil hat type shit I mean that one in particular is relatively straightforward Oh stupid that that's just it's fine a riot seasoning well discuss it the way that I think I form the structure of the lines that I form and gods or rhyming couplets and things like that I don't know maybe it's just yes the way I use the language or something confuses people work I mean that wasn't for example I guess it has two layers to some extent with yeah the poisoning of the population or we're all just no fluoride in the water that kind of thing long what they were playing cancer and it were look I kind of think and then the other side of it's just a more personal sort of level of bereavement and wanting to take revenge for my suffering on everyone else by putting cancer in the water but that's that's pretty dark yeah I don't know it's art you know it's it's it's not you know it's not a manifesto yeah yeah okay yeah all right all right all right I'm not I'm not gonna you know I'm not handing this off to police or anything after we're done recording is channeling into like a real pure kind of anger or whatever and then that doubled with what's like meant to be a sort of lifting gospel track we are exactly I mean it's very funniest as bad as if the song sounds so uplifting yeah I did just slamming extremes together and seeing what happens yeah I mean that that one's kind of it's in a dark where I guess you know I suppose dark as it gets really I mean a lot of the stuff was just more existential crisis like constantly yeah I mean probably huh and I'm something I'm quite abstract about it to some extent I tend to approach as if they're little fragments of dreams or nightmares about yeah and I don't I don't overthink lyrics I tend to just let them come into my head when I'm after I've finished things instrumentally and yeah it's just well Matt now that you're sort of stating that and kind of referencing the obvious you know tip of the hat toward very heavenly sort of religious music on that track I mean and maybe some of these kind of I guess maybe large somewhat conspiratorial ideas but sort of conspiratorial in jest you know is is there anything sort of deeper behind those themes sort of that are expressed on tracks like the gospel truth or during lyrical lines like when you're singing about the witch house and the reptiles and the Catholics and so on and so forth well that one in a meadow hopping tracking stop in debt / is that one was almost meant to be or not conspiracy theories as entertainment it's just just become more YouTube for though it's like shall I watch Breaking Bad or I could watch like some another 9/11 conspiracy thing it's I mean I don't necessarily mean me personally below yeah to the point where it has just diffused what could be some quite interesting points maybe at one stage but I don't know everything's open to ridicule for both sides in this one and really knows what the hell's going on anymore maybe that's the idea what sort of level of confusion and all that sort of things why I think it kind of adds to the theme that you were talking about earlier about how you know you feel like the music reflects just how overwhelming internet culture is yeah I mean it sounds my music is meant in some ways sound like my reaction to just yeah everything flying at you through a screen and just all the graphics everywhere and all the interaction and the screen scrolling up and down and like videos flying at you and comments flying around and opinions and judgments and all this kind of thing it's just yeah I think if you stop and think about the level of sensory overload that we all experience and from at the moment we wake up to the moment that is ridiculous day yes I guess that that's the essence of the music really and I mean the the the project itself from what I understand is is consciously named after I mean I honestly did not name after that I just kind of ran with it some extent I've never sold I've always said this I didn't name it after it but it felt kind of apt at the time I think so I was just clarity was just like this mantra I had for myself while I was writing and recording the album just to keep focused on my initial vision and no golf track and the Clarence bear maybe I came across the meme and didn't even think about it at the time something and it went in there it's a constantly watched itself into your head because thought the Clarence thing just felt right when I just wanted to personify and make it guess you know conquest give it a name a solo project or whatever because I didn't want it to be I wanted to be clear it was one person behind it's okay that's the only reason I brought that in really and then then realized I guess we know you start your project and you do your first Google surprise anyone taking is anyone taking it don't forget the meme came up in it it's not Clarence Clary as such is sudden Clary Clarence I thought I was right I mean and who's you know I don't I'm not really that involved in that side of the Internet to be honest so I didn't know how bagel like well known it was social it's not very well known because that was sort of the thing when I heard a music writer sort of you know professed that I went to go look up the me myself and I was like well this meme isn't very well-known or popular if you were going to name your project after such a saying it would seem like kind of an obscure thing to reference like something that I wouldn't even imagine your average person would even know about because in in looking them up I could only maybe find like maybe seven or eight of them you know and they didn't seem very well shared or copied you know that's I guess how it seemed to me so I just went a bit and just thought well you know the things move so fast it'll be forgotten about by the time I just keep learning musica anyway this mean that's been doing the rounds or whatever but it seems to be hanging in there and fortunately and does still pop up and I get asked the question a lot and yeah I mean I know it's fine I think now I'm starting this again a little bit tedious this idea of are they me deliberately trying to make anything but no I I hear I hear that you know that no I mean honestly like if you type most things into the internet there's probably a meme about them or it was a me there was a meme before them but that's kind of the thing about the Internet now you can almost like type in anything and it just kind of pops up yeah you know so talking about memes a little bit and just kind of you know your your lack of I guess kind of involvement and and probably you know interest as well sort of in that side of the Internet but also talking about how there are sides of the Internet that that do inspire you know you know when you're talking about how you can sort of hop on YouTube and spend all day watching conspiracy theory videos or watching sort of Netflix type stuff I mean what what other legs and kind of corners of the Internet do you find inspiring you or just kind of maybe pushing you away and you know just something you have no interest in as far as like current and it is the trap for me is just like the the social media I don't even use it that much but I haven't seen you post a single sandwich you've eaten or anything Twitter disappear I'm there I'm in the background in my sandwich I'm just no no it's not posted it yeah I suppose that it's this conflict between this constantly refreshing of social media and what have I missed since two seconds ago and all that kind of thing looks like instantaneous I need more and I need it now so those platforms like it's just social media in general I'm talking about and then the sort of infinite depth of knowledge that's on the Internet as well like a binge on science documentaries or something and like white not particularly academic stuff necessarily but just fill in my head with all that kind of thing and to know like history and all these things that should have a lot more substance back to back with things that are totally surface-level shit you know they don't need to know yeah that's that's it really I'm not like one of these people is like on the Silk Road or something I don't really go into the real bug so this album is not about the Deep Web there's no about the Deep Web okay you know it sounds like a potential sequel though yeah I thought it'd be interesting to record out in in the Deep Web someone thumb that yeah I must have done I don't know if anybody's done there yet just like we did put it out for free aware but just in there somewhere and just just bury it so you have a mean trouble it's the first person to just take it and put it everywhere but it'd be nice if you had to pull people in there are some weird dark debts all right the only place you can get it if it kept moving around or something yeah the further the first person might share it sort of on the main web and and everybody else who went searching for it would probably end up on some kind of FBI list yeah it may be so so is it safe to kind of say that that you in your music this reflection that you have of how overwhelming the Internet is how it inspires your inspires your lyrics in your creative process I mean are you sort of more critical of this modern facet of life are you just kind of embodying it in some kind of way because it seems like you're kind of hesitant towards some aspects of it and you dislike some aspects of it but you're also taking part in it yeah I mean it probably on a case-by-case basis I mean I don't it's not like I've got any particular gender against any one thing I mean ya know it's definitely just trying to reflect it in some way again that yeah it's not like I've got this manifesto about my music being this this internet thing or whatever I mean this is just I guess what we have where we've ended up in conversation or whatever but yeah and I'm definitely not like trying to put some case against it I mean it is it is where they were totally absorbed by now and it's probably in this in-between stage where we're one step away from some global consciousness and all that kind of thing and I mean I don't even feel pretty human half the time it's like my real life myself it's often avatars my internet self or some places yeah it's funny play something what do you do you find it easy these days or do you sort of make time for yourself to kind of unplug from all of it or do you think you know for yourself personally has it just become just a regular everyday facet of life and it's just kind of there and you accept it as being there yeah probably the latter I mean I do try and make time away from it I mean I think it's kind of an interesting part I guess I think everyone is maybe coming to this so crossroads where we feel like we need to have some sort of intervention in how we react to it and should we just like disappear down this rabbit hole that we don't don't know where it's gonna go really low or uh or should we be holding some classic humanity back and having a switch off day or whatever or I mean I think your personally personally I mean I think in theory the idea that sounds attractive but I kind of feel like I kind of feel like older generations of people every sort of idea or kind of fear that they've proposed in reaction to the modern age just hasn't really held any water and every single time I see somebody try to make that case that oh today's generation not living life to the fullest they're just with their heads buried in their phones and ba-buh ba-buh when you know the fact of the matter is that's what the previous generation said about every other generations new technology and and like you're just saying you know should we go down that rabbit hole I mean every other generation did and so right now so far right now I'm not seeing any kind of you know impending danger but I don't know how do you deal with it do you have a shutoff period or anything I mean I guess I guess I guess my excuse and my my my reasoning behind it all is is that social media and just the Internet is like my job you know it's so like whenever I'm on the Internet it's because it's my job but you know when I'm taking personal time I'm usually pretty careful about just you know not spending too much time on the internet but the thing is when I'm spending time you know away from my job you know I often end up in front of you know maybe like another screen or something maybe I'm watching a movie with my wife or something like that you know I mean yesterday I was at a wedding and that was fantastic and you know I had a very good time not being on social media at the wedding so I mean you know when I I make sure to take personal time and just take time off of work it just so happens that most of my time off of work also sort of involves no social media because to be on social media would be would mean to be doing work yeah you know so I mean I guess me allowing it to be my job has kind of allowed me to sort of put kind of a natural wall there because people don't want to be working all the time but for people who social media is kind of like an escape and something that is recreational maybe you know the their interaction whether it can be way different from mine yeah I think I think it's all good really it's just I try and I try and uh in terms of real-life relationships aware I do you well have a bit of a rule system of I think if you're interacting with someone so you're out dinner or whatever and that's meant to be a time for old-school human interaction actually looking after another then that's I mean maybe I'll get be annoyed about phones coming out at that point yeah but then the this whole thing of low everyone's stressing about having time to wind down and you always hear about these theories about I don't know like the sensory what phones don't your brain just before you go to sleep or like everyone falling asleep watching things and stuff like that having Netflix up in the background and all that I don't mean I'm a bit skeptical about if that's worth worrying about but yeah I think it's just making sure that it doesn't step over the line into distracting from actual human relationship away from the screen well yeah let's see anything that I think I try and actively keep oh yes all right so I mean there's there's a lot of modern contextual stuff here this kind of you know inspiring your music and inspiring your lyrics but but obviously there's there's a strong I guess musical component to what's inspiring what you do as well and I mean I I personally feel like a big hunk of that comes from the world of R&B contemporary R&B a and there's quite a few alternative R&B artists out there that take such a I guess a moody cavernous just reverb so kind of minimalist approach you know whereas your so maximal about it but it feels like you're still kind of staying true to the genre as far as like a lot of the vocal lines you're writing I mean some of the stuff that I hear on this record reminds me of you know just like commercial radio friendly R&B tracks that I remember growing up with in high school but they're kind of just updated with these with this really wacky production and I don't know it just kind of seems like you're so deep in something so incredibly experimental but you're you're recreating and referencing something that is so commercial and kind of innocent and simplistic I think it's meant to be a little bit of a pop art type thing and just like Reedus playing some of a little bit of the 90s Max Martin thing lower for a people actually Boys NSYNC that's all yes yeah like there were lions on there where I was telling my wife I was like this sounds like a freakin Backstreet Boys yeah yeah and is it's intentional it's just like this light there this should be plated thing being put through vicious blender and just totally I don't know reconstruct it into something hideous and ugly and then and I the beauty in the ugliness or whatever I am sort of curious as to kind of what that era of music was like in the UK because I mean I mean I remember what it was like in America because a lot of those groups are manufactured in America and not that there weren't a lot of those groups in the UK I mean you guys had the Spice Girls over there were you know one of the most monstrous girl groups of that decade but uh but yeah it just kind of seems like the the the music is very very well aware and very obviously referencing like the last era of boy bands and girl groups that yeah you know they're Backstreet Boys with huge over I think mmm anything not quite as much maybe but that tree boys definitely had more hits so yeah okay yeah I mean but then you know Justin Timberlake any solo things yes huge internationally obviously said I mean that I suppose maybe a maybe there are like not that intentionally but he's like justified us this record in it you know like some of the stuff will that I suppose cry me a river or that sort of thing but I mean what else a lot of it just comes back to just classic things like Michael Jackson but lesser extent Prince maybe but Michael Jackson's a massive one for me and it's not like I would ever think that I could sing perform in that way but I mean I've had more of a indie sort of grungy background maybe at one point I you know as more but grander in my adolescence and anything so going through different phases of how I wanted to use my voice and that get into this project I thought well could I do that and like make it work it's a I'll give it a go and I mean I tried to have it through it a few other so like who influences well I guess I mean maybe I don't work I mean almost like a defender Banhart thing I was into at one point never that's all fluttery kind of stuff or yeah there are all sorts of things but it's just the idea of cannot get away with this yeah I'll give it a go yeah I I think that's an interesting question to ask yourself in the Internet age because it just kind of seems like everybody's getting away with everything thank you till you make it so I might understand that a lot of these artists you know kind of kind of that boyband stuff a lot of that sort of large arena sized pop stuff is that something that you sort of came to understand and appreciate the artistry of later once you kind of got through this grunge phase in your adolescence I definitely have always liked a lot of everything did um did that that will alert just come through just then did but did you hear a noise I didn't hear a noise that's killer so just checking up I needed to like move some consumer yeah now I I've definitely been into a lot of everything my whole life and even even when I was having maybe a heavy Sonic Youth phase or something there's still be some I don't know a big good example oh yeah any of that stuff we're just talking about or then I mean there's hip hop happened in a big way not like in life not some artists in my life and I'd go into that in a much bigger way even though I'm sure it's a dance or a passing interest in it I think that's one of the last if as a genre where the thing that I'd go into no more just so I can get a grip of sort of when you might have been into certain radio trends how old are you now I don't want to talk about that okay all right all right just just in general like biographic stuff I just know that's that's that's completely find it that's completely fine I guess I'm just sort of curious because just kind of this and I don't know if this is sort of different in in the UK you can certainly tell me if that's the case but I feel like this this wide enjoyment of you know each genre kind of with with no sort of barriers you know as to certain genres being not music not as musical as other genres is something you know that I see more and more in this newer generation of music listeners than I did with people who I remember growing up with in high school who you know you had your people who were very very very much rocks and tricking and want to hear anything that wasn't rock music and you might hear people who are very pop centric and didn't want to be hearing anything that wasn't pop and a lot of the people who were into the underground stuff had a lot of animosity toward a lot of the pop stuff on the radio and the people who were in a hip hop didn't really want to venture too far outside of that realm either yeah yeah that's what it felt like for me I think it was a little more tribal and you had to make your Alliance of one thing or the other I think I definitely tried to stay out of that in a way and I just I just kept my head down didn't wanna be bothered so didn't particularly you know if you were into like new metal or whatever then you know you would be asking to have stuff thrown at you or wherever just walking around so I I guess I always did my own cool quiet thing but in general yeah I feel like things have changed in that sense and I guess it's coming back to the NSA isn't it like you can just cherry-pick from so much different stuff it's not like you know maybe you're trying to get your cues from one particular magazine or one radio show whatever is when it's when it's coming from everywhere I guess it's no surprise that people's identities maybe aren't quite as driven by genre I hope but that's how it feels to me anyway yeah it just kind of seems like there's no real sort of I guess investment on that tribal level when it comes to getting into things anymore when it comes to getting into certain genres it comes about because yeah I feel like one of the pros is that at least you know and you could build off of this I mean I feel like at least one of the pros is that at least there's more openness to different ideas to an extent yeah definitely I mean I think it's hard enough to get people to listen to my album but I think maybe if this was you know ten years ago would be even worse because it just would literally you can't put it on any shelf in the record shop away but it doesn't fit in a genre but thankfully I think there's a lot of other people do that with the same sort of ideas and they're getting away of it as well and yeah though people are more open-minded and I'll listen to it but because there's so much other stuff doesn't mean they're gonna listen to it for long so well I had it I had an interesting conversation with this uh with his Maryland band dope body and we were talking about sort of a similar thing and how the intricate how the internet gives us so much access to so many interesting and alternative things but kind of their answer to that was that it also gives you access to way more candy and then then it then you ever had access to before - yeah definitely I mean I know sometimes I think as a musician I should be trying to give more time to things but I kind of hate myself for it but I am doing the same thing I'm hoppin around all the time and everybody is digesting music the same way now yeah I mean I suppose it's interesting in a way like from an artistic perspective and how can we bend not know in a bad compromising way but what opportunities artistically are there for reframing and restructuring music into you know saying vine or whatever I you know suddenly Evan was it seven seconds or whatever like people you know people making interesting stuff out of those limitations maybe even though it's not as defined in terms of music we are just gonna have to start making 30-second tracks I like if you kind of seems like that is that that might be the case but at least from my personal standpoint with all the albums that I've covered this year I feel like so many records are getting longer and your record is very long I felt like another very popular record from this year the new Kendrick Lamar records very long I've had a good handful of relatively popular and buzzed-about records that I had to review that were 90 minutes in length the new Prairie and record the new titus andronicus record the new Kumasi washington record was three hours long there's another one that I'm probably forgetting as well the new Iron Maiden record I kind of feel like the digital age has also allowed us to just print and create as much music we feel like printing and creating and a lot of artists are kind of taking advantage of that well maybe some of that is a bit of a backlash from what we're just talking about with the short attention spans and that when you know full well that you're only gonna you're gonna get handful of singles they're gonna come out to like promote a record and you're lucky if anyone's going to listen to it from one 10-second so I do that but then in the background of that it gives you almost more freedom to do whatever the hell you want you fall in peace you know you can see it's almost like I'm assuming that most people are never gonna listen to it so I can just do whatever I want with it and sort of totally make it so contortion aware of it doesn't matter but then on the other hand you've got the just the idea that it's so open-ended from a technical standpoint as in you know the record had to fit on vinyl or whatever and it then it CDs came and everyone's putting out 80-minute records or you know whatever I what the limitations are car member but you know these overblown might dance arms and lectronimo puns and stuff that went on forever and then now it's like having it infinite or wherever it I guess it you get a lot of shorter albums as well I would say the Mac DeMarco or whatever like um things coming out but barely qualify for a for an album or whatever but you know it gets a way that then it's cool when it works in that context I suppose with with my thing it was like well I'm that long is it's just over an hour guess it just yeah a lot of tracks but I mean it's just why not thanks wise well there's no limitations so what if it works where do you see yourself the sort of fitting into this other trend that I'm seeing a lot lately I think a lot of artists sort of feel this pressure to be coming out with something constantly in sort of ually contributing to this whole you know i guess over cluttered internet that we're dealing with currently simply because sort of constantly saying something in constantly doing something in constantly releasing something means more opportunities for them to kind of engage their fan base and for people to stumble across them you know I'm definitely up against that bit myself and I think as in I've been encouraged and pushed to keep putting out new stuff like I think it's just because it may be less money in the industry or whatever then maybe people could afford to disappear for a couple of years ten fifteen twenty years ago whatever come back with the next record on the next cycle or whatever but that doesn't really exist anymore I think you've been pretty fortunate position if you can afford to disappear for a while no my position on you've been very much encouraged to just let's get the next thing together quick and Kate let's keep up the momentum let's stay quite quite as visible and you know I mean it is fine by me because I uh luckily I guess I am just constantly creative and one capacity or another anyway but yeah there definitely is a pressure to to keep it going at all times and it's been in terms of a music's fine but in terms of like social media and stuff like that I I'm not the most natural or that kind of thing so I'm having to look like I'm having to but I'm training myself to be a bit more in that mindset but I know some people come so naturally to doesn't it but maybe maybe yourself I don't know sort of asking a few more questions you know just a couple more left I wanted to ask you sort of about the the musical future of this project and since you're you know saying that you're always kind of creating where do you kind of see things conceptually and just kind of stylistically with the project going in the future because you know like you were saying earlier musically it's so uncatted erisa balandin so in catalan category of all it's kind of difficult to project the trajectory of them because where do you when something is so out of place you know where does it even go from there I mean you know it certainly seems to reflect all of these elements of pop music to an extent and I guess it could either get more accessible and become clearer and become maybe a little bit more readable or it could go further down that you know experimental rabbit hole but outside of that it just kind of seems like anything sort of a fair game yeah think of I've taken a bit of time from finishing the album to I've done some a couple of different projects may or may not actually see the light of day but just to sort cleanse the palate a little bit and mull over what I want to do next and I've only just recently sort of put together more concrete things that could be the second album but the way it might my instinct with it is that I probably just go to the extremes as in the pop stuff pop tracks would be super accessible and super radio and just see how far I can push that without vomiting on myself you know and then the experimental stuff just push it so hard and like totally alienate everyone to an almost comic level you know I don't know that that's my initial feeling of love maybe where I could take it and have it all going off at the same time you know so it's all inside of one record in it just being this mad car crash like it in a in more extreme way than the first one was maybe I don't know but yeah I'm still working that stuff out and I think another thing I was like what you're saying with um not being able to work out maybe where things are going with a nice like me is I think I can keep a consistency if I'm careful about the sounds I'm using and not completely wiping the slate clean and you know doing my rock album or something it just I keep in enough that it keeps an anchoring with the first album and yeah I think I think I know rough I'm gonna do and is it safe to say the next record will be out on Bella Union as well or I can't really confirm either way at the minute as as I haven't actually done any music for the second record officially yes I guess the ball will be in their court over down the line but yeah alright and uh sort of behind this record recently you're sort of behind your next record in the future I mean have you been playing behind any of this stuff live as well yet are you planning on doing more live dates behind this stuff and how does you know a live clarence clarity show even go down a lot more live band we've done yeah we've done a fair bit of live stuff this year but it was kind of like tour supports at the start of the year and then we just things weren't at the profile unfortunately well could be hitting every festival around the world so we were just doing as much as we could get on really like festivals every other weekend through the summer and yeah we just did the last one last night and that sort of rounded up the summer season or whatever so now we're just trying to get some things in place for us touring actually so yeah we and in terms of South it's it's real drums with with some samples involved as well and then MPC and keyboards and bass guitar and yeah it's all it's a lot I've been a bit more punk-rock and where there are sort of guitar elements in in the music that's that's that's brought out like I play guitar and sing and manipulate my voice live and stuff like that so yeah I didn't I didn't want it to be that you know one guy on a laptop not really sure what he's up to kind of thing I know that I've got anything against that by thought for my overblown sort dramatic music it needed something a bit more justice or what else well we're I don't know just something a bit more relatable from an audience one if y'all wanted see then to be able to see something relate to the world stage like you know hitting the guitar strings or whatever yeah something a bit more real away because the whole thing's so unreal I don't know though it anchor it a little bears on bit bringing the Unreal into reality yeah exactly yeah yeah I'll go with that all right okay all right well again thanks for just kind of peeling back the veil a little bit on this new record and talking with me and just letting us in on the creative process and just kind of the future of what you're doing a little bit to know thank you very much appreciate getting behind this it's been it's been really good for exposure and then yeah not hopefully that was insightful to someone somewhere but yeah it's all good dude again thanks for coming on have a good one yeah thank you 
EbBnSnO_f0s,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new battles record ladi Dadi battles are a new york experimental rock band this is their third full-length album they also have connections to numerous underground rock bands in math rock and post-hardcore groups like tomahawk and helmet and Don cab but but but over the years they have developed a following entirely their own thanks to their fantastic breakout record in the late 2000s mirrored which was put out on warp records and the band stuck with the label as they released their sophomore full-length album even though they released that record right after a pretty significant lineup change losing their multi-instrumentalist and lead singer Jill die braxton but they took this loss as an opportunity to invite other vocalists onto the band's music and it led to some of my favorite battle songs of all time tracks like my machines as well as ice cream and on this record battles also embarked on all these really long colorful intense instrumental jams it was hard for me not to get wrapped up in the band's kind of futuristic sound it wasn't a perfect record that was kind of a boring track here and there and it was a little too compressed for my tastes but still it was one of my favorite records of the year and I love that record so much that I was pretty excited to hear this new album over here because from the tracks leading up to the release of this album it seemed like we were getting a another helping of gloss drop on this record the band is opting out of a vocal accompaniment altogether and are giving us a 12 track 50-minute album that is just based completely on the band's instrumental chops and once again on this LP battles drop some pretty interesting and great high-quality sounds we have crisp resonant clear just very vibrant drums and and drum playing some slinky guitar leads and very interesting little electronic glitches here and there keyboards once again the trademark kind of heavy organ sound that battles use in a lot of their tracks shows up once more but altogether battles don't really seem to be serving up anything too different from what they had been doing on their last record about four years ago altogether just a very similar sound which I think kind of ends up working against this album to be honest instead of just no vocals on this record sort of liberating battles and encouraging them to experiment a bit more with structure and with sound because they're not kind of basing their tracks around these pop song structures like they were on many of the songs with guest vocals on their last record instead they have kind of fallen into a bit of a comfortable and a familiar rut with an album that I think really lacks any significant experimentation and is kind of middle-of-the-road and tame at least by battle standards now I do like the opener on this record the Yabba which kicks off like in this five eight time signature and is one of the most subtle tracks as far as the beginning of a battle song and builds to a really bustling intense finish I like the way the song evolves and progresses it has numerous parts to it I thought it was a nice little instrumental Odyssey I love the song mega touch to the beautiful little eerie melody that first introduces itself in the track early on is pretty beautiful and I like how sort of unpredictable the track is each new section and sort of instrumental shift and it is entirely different from the previous moment in the track but a lot of the shorter sort of mid-sized deep cuts on this record there's nothing really that spectacular or special about them tracks like dotnet and FF badda these tracks bring some decent grooves and that's about it they feel like a milder version of a lot of the instrumental jams off of gloss drop with less I guess structure and less experimentation unless exploration and less of a strong melodic character less intense not quite as dramatic either these characteristics are thing that tracks like Wall Street off of gloss drop brought in spades instead many cuts off of ladi Dadi sound like battles four years ago could have performed and written these tracks in their sleep some of the melodic components of these tracks to feel really redundant and uninteresting as well sort of like on the song summer simmer where I feel like we have this sort of tedious build-up only to lead us to a really soulless lead guitar melody and some squawking guitar noises I mean it's not really that fantastic of progression again the performances are on point there's nothing too out of place or anything like that and the production is very clear it's very rich the sounds are vibrant but the writing is just pretty drab I just feel like battles are seriously working underneath their creativity level on this record even some of my favorite cuts on this LP feel like they could have been swapped out with any number of tracks on gloss drop and it would have made for just kind of a alright moment like with the song non-violence where the only thing that really sticks out to me about this track is that has some pretty cool syncopated guitar riffs and drums which make for an interesting little experiment in the midst of the track and the song calm has one of the coolest starts of any track on this entire record battles kind of embracing that more electronic side of their sound but the thing is it doesn't really progress to an interesting place which i think is the issue for most these tracks they start off well enough and they had that battle sound they have that battles vibe there's a good point a but there's either no point B or point B is just so similar to point a I just feel like I haven't moved or progressed anywhere and then it gets even worse with some of the shortest tracks on here like tying where where battles clearly just recorded a warm-up or like some kind of test or something in the studio and are trying to pass it off as a track are we seriously trying to tell ourselves this track was written this was written this sounds like a like a bit of a practice session or something and it's just BAM on the record the closer on here has some interesting moments where all the instrumentation just kind of slows down all of a sudden out of nowhere but it's it's it's really just too little too late to start doing some cool experimental stuff there have been so many bland and to sort of predictable moments on the album so far it's not really you know pulling things together there's so many bland and predictable moments leading up to this point it's not exactly the the three-pointer that sort of shot just as the clock is running out that wins the game I think that I appreciate that battles didn't want to do a pop record this time around they didn't want to come through with music that sort of had that strong pop sensibility like they had on glass drop they didn't want to do something super sugary but I don't think they replaced that sugar I don't think they replaced that sweetness with something else it just kind of feels like I'm listening to what battles was doing four years ago but it doesn't pop it doesn't snap it doesn't Electrify quite as much it doesn't even feel like they replaced this pop enus with anything truly experimental or adventurous either I would actually say that there are moments on Glaus drop that are far more experimental especially the closer far more experimental than anything that's done on this record got to say despite the fact that battles I think has been one of my favorite rock bands of the modern era and I thought their last record is probably going to be one of my favorite albums as far as rock music of this decade no question about that this album was just too severe letdown for me again I just think they're really working underneath what their potential is on here and I'm not exactly sure what kind of held them back from doing something more ambitious this time around I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition have you given this record of listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you like it more than me did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Anthony Fantana battles forever 
iu3A2oobvDI,hey everybody Anthony Fantan oh here it turn its busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Libertines record anthems for doomed youth this is the latest full-length LP from the break out British band that hit it pretty big in the mid and late 2000s and they have been studio album silent for the past 10 years despite starting off pretty strong with their full-length debut however the band's very volatile personal issues and member dynamics kind of shot their career in the foot a little bit however the band seems to have gotten their act together and now they're performing together again and recording together again hopefully it lasts and obviously it's lasted long enough to get this album together so in listening to this album I didn't want to just talk about it by myself I have invited Joel aka the daily guru - come on discuss this new Libertines album with me we are going to use the power of the internet to transition to that discussion transition and here we are through the magic of the internet joel of the daily guru is here talking with me about this new Libertines record Joel what you think of the sound I think if I had to sum it up in two words it would be pleasantly surprised I was I was pleasantly surprised with how long a break they took off that this wasn't just a complete disaster especially considering the people involved really Joe we're good we're gonna call it a break we're gonna call it a break that seems to be putting it nice I mean I want to put it nicely there's I feel like with these guys there's so much you can say but it's been said a million times that you know I just kinda want to concentrate on where they are not what's been going on thirty months since they first appeared on the scene we know why they were on a break and why they weren't really playing with each other and we know why Pete looks the way he does right now but I was pleasantly surprised with with how the overall product sounded didn't sound super dated they didn't sound old it sounded fresh and and that really was good for me okay I mean it's it's it's safe to say that I think a lot of us weren't really expecting another record maybe ever again but you know now they're back together and they're playing again and they've recorded this record you you're surprised with quality of the record yeah especially you know I saw that the guy who produced this one you know they stopped using Mick Jones and as a huge clash fan that to me was in huge red flag I was like why why would you stop with a guy like that and I believe the person who did produce it produced for one direction and Lady Gaga and people like that so this to me could have gone really bad for so many reasons and I'm not saying it's good because it wasn't bad I felt that this was a record of two sides I really didn't care for the first half which we can get into the second half to me though was a very very cool album that I will play again and again yeah I can agree with you that the album definitely did not sound dated and maybe moving to another producer you know with those kind of credentials is part of the reason why the record doesn't have sort of an older sound to it you know even though you know we can look back to their debut record and their sophomore and and could essentially you know see those very much as to thousands records there were a lot of sounds on those albums that sounded like throwbacks to a lot of older you know English German composer ultimately free of that for the most part I kind of I mean I really feel like barbarians definitely had a new order feel to it maybe even though yeah yeah and then actually there were a couple times where it almost sounded to me like they were ripping off the wall as in Pink Floyd's the wall just in the overall mood specifically the song nobody's home on the I think that's the third side the milk man's horse really resonated with that just kind of the dejected vocal that you get there and then we like that's wrong I I did it I end dead for love the last track really to me just said this is screaming like they've been listening to the wall way too much I mean to me to me the milk man's horse didn't didn't really read his Floyd or anything like that I don't know if you were saying that that was that that was the case but it did Maria he is Floyd as much as it did like uh Radiohead's creep but with way like depression and like you know almost as if they're just like imbuing less sadness into it I felt like a very mild take on a very similar chord progression mm-hmm yeah I mean I think I think that they weren't as heavy a nod to some of those older bands and they weren't as frequent you know I don't want to say it sounds like a new band but a lot of those old tracks is really like okay we get it you're into these bands we know they kind of broke away from it a bit but I definitely felt like okay there they're there they're still doing it enough the the track the title track actually to me was a ripoff on the riff of sixpence nuns the written on the Richards kiss me I'm sure a lot of people are really thinking about that when they think about The Libertines but I couldn't get it out of my head was listening to that song that that it was the same thing on so many levels yeah I mean there were a lot of moments on this record where the influences on the songs were really obvious but I think there were at least a handful of moments where I think the the songwriting and the balladry on these tracks are really good I really did like the closer just like you did and I don't know if you cared for a Waterloo as much as I did that was definitely a stand I was one of the best ballads on the entire record like you know definitely a supremely sad song and a track that red is very sad which you know was was important for me because I think a lot of the other tracks on this record I don't think the emotions translated quite as powerfully as they did on this track yeah I agree Waterloo I felt like it would have been the perfect closure to the whole album and so I thought maybe that was like the end of the first side on the vinyl version but I checked and it's actually not I really like the mood on that and I think kind of with what you were saying though lyrics on this record are a lot better than the music and I think that some of the lyrics they just fall short because the music the mood doesn't is it captured because the the music just comes up short and and and I think maybe where it comes up shortest are on a lot of the upbeat and peppier tracks with maybe the exception of barbarians I thought that that was a great start to the record they sounded way more explosive than I ever anticipated that they would but there were other cuts on here like I don't know the second half of the the first half of belly of the beast which really doesn't fell apart for me and then once they actually brought things up to a higher temperature in the second half I was kind of like okay you know maybe a little bit a little too late on that and and then I think a Glasgow Coma Scale Blues had to refer to my notes to remember that sound tunnel I feel like that was one of the handful of moments on the record where the band has the the the kind of usual ragtag sloppiness that made them so charming during the old days but the energy isn't there so it just kind of sounds sloppy and droopy and just like not quite as exciting yeah as yeah and like I like to get the bars on a dangerous combo for me you know just that that lack of cohesion together with the lack of energy just is not a good look you know if if you know you're sloppy but you're putting everything into it you know that's that's one thing you know you're just wild and all over the place and out of control but you know to sort of be sloppy and just kind of this is just not that captivating yeah I felt like belly of the beast it just it didn't take off and I also felt the next song Iceman it was waiting to explode to me it came off like an acoustic demo that they never really finished and and when it does get that that that rise it's it's too late and and also I felt like the lyrics on that one were a bit too heavy-handed with you know don't spend your days and haze we we got it we we know what most of these songs are about but you know the the Glasgow Blues let's just call it that I like the guitars on it I really liked the guitars I thought it had a solid rip to it but you know I think kind of like with Iceman it felt unfinished to me and they kind of sat in this middle ground on a number of songs where they didn't want to get when they were quiet it was Moody we know they can do that well they continue to do that well but whenever they turned it up they only kind of got it once or twice for me yeah no I I agree you know I just think this record is just a little mixed for me I mean there's some great standout ballets here and I like that you know it's it seems like there are some moments here like on Waterloo like on the closer here there are some moments of real maturity things you know sort of little growth spurts that I think that we just never got the opportunity to watch The Libertines really grow into with just them being silent for so many years unfortunately and you know we're getting those those little whiffs of maturity now but it's just delayed unfortunately and there are some spots that do sort of call back to the more energetic days like I said the opener fame and fortune as well the attract a fury of tone berry which had like this classic kind of English snottiness to it coming through on the vocals and they're really you know pretty pretty tight upbeat track but then you know there there were a lot of moments where I feel like the band's I don't know rustiness has kind of caught up with them a little bit as far as the music side of things I mean lyrically like you were saying there's some interesting moments on this record where obviously they're referencing the band's kind of volatile past and for hardcore fans I think that's going to be really interesting but you know don't go into this thing and be surprised if not every tune here resonates with you because you know some of the songs here can be just a little met yeah I wrote that down a lot I was just like Matt on a number of them also you know with fame and fortune I wasn't a huge fan I felt like it sounded like the song right before it done get in and for some reason I also had the Oompa Loompas from Willy Wonka marching around in my head I felt like you know I don't know something about it just didn't throw Stu track so I'm really similar to you yes they did currently that kind of strong reggae vibe though yeah yeah and I thought well with with with Gunga Din they were clearly giving a nod to the clash it really had that which is nothing new for them but yeah I felt like they sounded a bit too similar for me and fury though was probably my second favorite song in the record solid breath really it when it came on I said yes this is this is what I've been looking for this entire album and I think that's why anchored the second half of the record so well I really the first half of the record I probably won't go back to but the last six songs overall I will definitely listen to them again I really really enjoyed it all right overall I mean you know I thought this record was decent I'm not too crazy about it though mostly sort of been different I'm sort of feeling like a strong five to light six on this thing I don't know if you're enjoying it more than me though yeah the the first side to me got about a two but the second side got a 5 so I'll average it out and say I give it strong six from six I will listen to the second half of this record for sure okay well Joel thanks again for coming on and talking to me about this new Libertines record - not a problem only the pleasure I will link you guys to Joel's YouTube channel down in the description box and you will probably be talking with me about many different rock albums in the future and yeah that's it anthony Fantana joel dilly guru or their teens review forever 
mnD2O7RsqcY,oh boy hi everyone jihadi Fatah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new whitey Morgan record sonic ranch whitey Morgan is a Michigan singer-songwriter guitarist he's been at it for a while now this is his fourth full-length album I believe which I stumbled across on Bandcamp and looking at the cover of this thing going into it I sort of assumed I was going to be getting some kind of country record but little did I know I'd actually be getting an album in my favorite leg of the country genre outlaw contra if you're not familiar with outlaw country it's the misbehaved shootin snortin drug and drinkin fightin cousin or sub-genre to the just main country genre which used to have way more visibility with a lot of country's major artists back in the day dabbling in it on numerous records like Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash but if you wanted to deeper into outlaw countries discography you can listen to Merle Haggard David Allan Coe Johnny paycheck Waylon Jennings Kris Kristofferson they're actually a lot of pretty fantastic outlaw country artists the shame in it though is that a lot of these artists albums are out of print and a lot of them haven't made it over on the iTunes either so finding this stuff sometimes can be kind of hard and country just in general has been a little slow to kind of embrace the internet age and I completely understand why I mean a lot of country music fans aren't necessarily using the internet to find new country music so they're kind of isn't that pressure to alter the current business model so a lot of what people are hearing is kind of the very formulaic generic somewhat trashy pop country that makes it onto the radio which is why I've never really done that many country music reviews recently even though I've enjoyed very passionately a lot of older country records simultaneously it's also why I've never really commented on what I think about country music in general a lot of people have been like Oh country sucks Anthony you should you should talk about how country sucks and honestly I don't really think country sucks what I think is probably the case is that there's a lot of fantastic underground country that us as Outsiders to that world don't necessarily have you know our fingers on the pulse of and it's going to take guys like whitey Morgan to sort of put their music out there on the Internet where it's just more easy to stumble upon so that we can actually get a glimpse into that world as far as the modern artists in the genre go and there are a few other country artists out there who have taken that risk and and put themselves out there and put their records onto the Internet and if have played the internet marketing game a little bit better people like Sturgill Simpson or Hank Williams a third or even Daniel Romano but these artists I found to either be maybe a little too nostalgic or maybe just completely missing the mark entirely though that's just my opinion you're perfectly free to check out those artists for yourselves and their new record and sort of see if they interest you but Whitey's record right here is the first new country record in a while to really stop me in my tracks and and also a record that feels like an authentic country record not just like one of these indie folk or indie Americana or indie country records which is fine I enjoy a lot of that stuff but you know it's it's kind of like city slickers but I really do want to hear some more records every year that sort of had that authentic country sound to it and Whitey's got it and like I said earlier he brings that kind of refreshing modern punch and clarity with his lyrics and the instrumentation on this thing too the production on this thing is heavy the guitar sound very clear pristine the base is very resonant and very thick the pedal steel on this thing sounds fantastic the drums are booming there's some pretty heavy songs on this thing and wide he sits atop all of this instrumentation kind of with his bellowing voice he has a very deep deep singing voice and there's a very tight harmonies on it which are reminiscent of newer country music which is fine it sounds great it's executed very well and just his singing style it's very reminiscent of many older country singers I have a hard time kind of seeing his singing voice as distinct but I do think he is a good singer and he's got a lot of good tunes on this record too on my second listen to this album I found myself singing along to a lot of songs and the track listing here like good time and man that's how I got to Memphis which is a song of relocating for love an interesting little story there I also like the song me and the whiskey fantastic open around this record but I like with how I got to Memphis there's some pretty good stories on this record - whitey spins a few interesting tales here I'm pretty in awe of the darkness on the song waiting around to die not only is the production on this thing heavy I mean super heavy kind of reminds me of Earth in a really weird way but very super heavy production and a very dark story just touching down a lot of different instances of betrayal and going to jail and even domestic abuse again very dark song this is the kind of stuff that I love outlaw country for it just rides the fringes it has a lot of dark imagery and subject matters dealt with in the lyrics this was gangsta before gangsta rap even existed and I should probably also know that this track is a Townes Van Zandt cover as well also kind of has a vibe similar to that of like Bob Seger's what's the track freak and turn the page really just heavy slow dramatic song we also have some very great solos and just instrumental passages not only on this track I love the way the instrumentation speeds up into a nice solo bridge on me and the whiskey really fantastic performance there the pedal steel embellishments and solos throughout this record a one and low-down on the backstreet has some fantastic honky-tonk piano little solos and embellishments all over that too but I will say that I am not always completely captivated by whitey as a singer and a storyteller I think the middle point of this record kind of has less instrumental risks and less instrumental ambition a lot of musical cliches and chord progressions that are way too familiar on some of these songs in the middle spot of this and not really too wowed by a lot of Whitey's lyrical content here he brings a lot of very sad moody songs at this point in the record but he doesn't always have the story to really kind of back it up and make that sadness hit home for the listener in any kind of way I think he just kind of generally touches down on the sort of lowdown tear and your beer type lyrical imagery that a lot of other country artists typically do and I also feel like he fails to establish the the sense of danger by giving us some gritty lyrics on the song go down rockin where he's talking about being you know caught in some trouble but we really don't get a strong sense of what that trouble is or why you know there's nothing really there in this track keeping me on the edge of my seat however the record does pick up a little bit in the last third or so with song good time and man love that tune and it's one of the sadder songs on this record where I'm actually moved legitimately moved by the lyrics and the final two cuts here just to finish this record off really strong one ain't gonna take it anymore one of my favorite songs on the entire record and for a few reasons this is one of the most badass outlaw country songs that has been recorded in a while at least to my knowledge and it's hilarious it's a hilarious song he's not only hilarious on the hook here where he's saying if I'm going down tonight I'm going down drinking and each of these hooks are complemented by a verse where he's kind of telling this story where he comes home and his girlfriend his wife is angry and she's been looking through his phone which is an amazing moment on this record because rarely do you see sort of these older forms of music or just kind of more nostalgic forms of music making such blatant references to new technology in the modern age so she's looking through this and she's about to lecture him but before he even gets the chance he just runs out of the house with a bottle of wine and he's like if I'm going down I'm going down drink and and I love it that's why I love a lot of outlaw country records and and I feel like that side of the genre and and that side of Whitey's personality which he obviously does incredibly well because this is one of the best and most fun and entertaining songs in the entire record isn't emphasized quite as much as it could be because man he's just gotta he's just got a sharp sense of humor and I just wish it came throwing more tracks that's all yeah overall I really enjoyed this record I mean I just wish I got more personality more strong storytelling more strongly Racal content and maybe a few more instrumental risks here and there I mean I love how waiting rounded I came out such a thunderous song and not that I wish that more songs on the record were more thunderous but that was clearly a bit of a moment of genius with the production a bit of an experimental moment something that I don't think a lot of new country artists are doing whitey clearly has this talent for bringing out the old replicating the classic sounds tastefully but also bring in some new stuff too just to make it interesting and make it feel I guess kind of updated I'm really liking this record I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing I recommend that you give it a listen you might like it a lot more than me if you're into country music or if you're just kind of you know morbidly curious and you've enjoyed a lot of those older country records maybe you're already familiar with outlaw country but you're not conscious of a lot of new outlaw country this is definitely worth a listen and I'm hoping that this record as well as guys like Sturgill Simpson and so on and so forth are the beginning of a new age where we see a lot of these authentically country artists or ours that are trying to create an authentic country sound competing on the Internet and putting the records out there for just a wider audience to hear because I think there are a lot of people out there that would love to hear records and love to hear stories like the stories that are presented on this album but if only they had the chance or if only the music was placed onto a platform where it could be spread and celebrated it a little bit more widely I understand that that's going to be you know the artists decision to do that at the end of the day but at least I can say for my own personal standpoint as a music fan as a fan of many forms of popular music that's something I would love to hear that is a change that I look forward to happening if it ever does so again give this record of listen and Tramp 
P5chMXYVv1g,be two-zip hi everyone zennith anikó tano here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new j-rock project not 9 double O 5 9 j-rock is a California rapper known very well for his affiliation with the hip hop crew click black hippy he is also a sign e2 Top Dawg entertainment as well meaning his label mates with scissor and Kendrick Lamar schoolboy q absol and my first exposure to j-rock was the same as many other people back in 2011 when TDE was first blowing up a lot of the respective members of TDE were first blowing up and j-rock dropped his commercial full-length debut follow me home and while lyrically and flow wise and instrumentally this record definitely had the basics down in a lot of respects this just kind of felt like a bit of a standard gangsta rap record for me but there was also a point in TDE history where every other member of TD and black hippy were a little underdeveloped as well but eventually each member came out with their own breakout record which was fantastic and and followed up that album too but on the studio album front j-rock has been a little silent for the past four years but last year he started dropping singles like parental advisory a really hard nosed gangsta rap track banger that I am kind of disappointed didn't make it on to the standard edition of this record the singles to me were saying that j-rock was staying true to his story true to himself but just getting a little more artful and musical and out there which is kind of the same direction each member of TDE took but sort of in their own way i pre-ordered this thing because I was so excited for this record because I figured this album with every TDE record as of late being of such a high level of quality for the most part I how could I go wrong I figure this thing's like a layup also the idea of making this record come out sooner by pre-ordering it was pretty enticing too although I'm not really sure if this album would have come out on this date regardless either way going into this record I think I was maybe too ready to just expect it to be great because I feel like the album that I ended up getting isn't amazing it's not bad it's just it's decent in some ways j-rok to me is like the grittiest and most hard-nosed and just most that tough-as-nails member of TDE but he came through with like the softest album now there are highlights on this record I love the song necessary the 9mm five nine refrain at the very beginning of that track catchy as hell and when the be eventually drops in its a banger it's off-kilter its quirky its colourful j-rock sounds mean as hell his lyrics are just he's such a cold-blooded bastard it sounds modern it sounds new in a lot of ways it kind of feels like the same direction schoolboy q took oxymoron in but j-rock has his you know own personal vibe he very clearly sounds influenced by 50 cent by Tupac it's an amazing start to the record it's like just dropping a bomb right at the start of the album and then we get the song easy-bake with scissor and Kendrick and both of them are fantastic on this track and there's a really great beasts which in the middle of the song too that adds a lot of character seems there are a lot of beasts witches going on in 2015 I mean this is another one that goes down well and j-rock sounds fantastic over these two very different bits of instrumental on both sides of this album the instrumentals j-rock himself continuing to bring a lot of character and not only are his verses solid but he's switching up what he's doing vocally to I mean in these first two tracks were already getting a lot of dynamics ruining that kind of grimy gravel voice j-rock this weird voice j-rock where he's kind of you know just all over his vocal range and uh but he still comes through with just a really mean attitude that still makes his lyrics captivating but then I feel like the record just drops off so quickly we get the song gumbo where I feel like the very lacks singing on the hook here is really drab it's not interesting at all and the very smooth easygoing instrumental I mean it's not bad but I kind of feel like in the first third of the record we've just kind of doused a whole bucket of water on to the amazing flames that we've built up with the first two songs Jay rocks versus really aren't that bad they're some of my favorite verses on the entire record I love the line on here where he raps about being the eye of the tiger in the eye of the storm and there's some other great bars in this track too and I like how the concept of the song sort of references I guess the the randomness of the word association that happens in a lot of hip-hop music how a lot of rap bars do kind of feel like when you collect all the things that are referenced or mentioned like gumbo and the hook can kind of be like adding flavor to that I mean an interesting concept but again instrumentally and hook wise a bit of a weak moment this song actually introduces a pretty long lull in the middle of the record the song the ways introduces kind of another light trap beat j-rock comes through with a really nutty delivery at the first verse of the song and then we get a bunch of filler verses later in the track and a really throw away chorus I feel like at the beginning of the track we're just getting such a hodgepodge j-rock doesn't even really match the energy of the instrumental I feel like he's trying to make up for the fact that this record has so many light beats by just going a little insane on a lot of the verses here and the song telegram I feel like it's it's not a bad track by itself but it's another song that gets lost in the mush of very unentertaining slower tracks in the track listing here I appreciate that j-rock tried to come through with a theme here but the sort of story of love on the rocks and sort of having a hard time of keeping a relationship together while being a famous rapper I don't know it just sounds a little tedious now in a sense this record does come back with the title track with a banger beat J rocks verses on here sound pretty great although maybe with more listens the hook does sound maybe a little bit of a put-on with Jay Rock pulling so much influence from ol Dirty Bastard on this chorus it's okay and the song Vice City featuring Kendrick Lamar schoolboy q and abs soul I really like this track but I just kind of feel like it's just another moment in context of this record that doesn't really add any momentum to this thing again by itself I think it's a decent song it's a weird track the flow is totally strange Kendrick Lamar instead of just coming through and really starting to track hard there's a false start right at the beginning of this song Kendricks verse to me is easily maybe the least interesting of the entire record absol is my favorite on the entire record j-roc and schoolboy q hold their own as well the structure is a little bit of a hodgepodge but I like the fact that we do have four MCS here in a pretty interesting slow rubbery beat with some awesome bass that features artists that are such a high level of talent they could do something so weird on this track with the flow with the beat with their lyrics and it still comes through as a pretty coherent song but to me this track should have been another control verse you know this track should have lit on fire I mean it's definitely intriguing it's interesting it's trying something different and for the most part it succeeds but I just feel like it adds to the ongoing love of this album and this record isn't even that long the last three tracks in the track listing here are our snoozers as well as I'm just dying of thirst for something exciting to happen on this album J Rock storytelling at the start of fly-on-the-wall isn't really that bad it's pretty good again I can't really fault a lot of J rocks verses on this record I just wish the instrumentals were more interesting and vibrant in in-your-face this track this verse could have easily done just as well over a hardier just more interesting instrumental and then Busta Rhymes I mean while his flow is is nice he's all over the place I mean Busta is is doing stuff now that he was not doing in the 90s in terms of technical skill and all that but I feel like he just kind of spends his entire verses complimenting j-roc and just talking about how amazing he is which I mean it's it's nice to get such a cosign from a vet like that but still I feel like if you're going to bring a dude like Busta onto a track it's got to be on something a little harder a little more exciting money trees deuce that I like by itself but another cut that gets lost in the mush of this record and the message is just just it just feels like such a non-essential moment for a track like this to essentially end the album off on a soft note is like completely futile because nearly every track on this album is a soft note in some kind of way so to try to do something just kind of easygoing and tender at the end of the album just seems like what's what's the point at this point one point you're not going to get any more introspective here than you did on the rest of the record and that's another thing while I appreciate that j-rock tried to do something justice just a little bit more tender and a little bit more thoughtful on this record it's not like he's slowed things down so that we can hear him sort of dive down to these subterranean emotional and lyrical depths because I don't really feel like he's he's sort of approaching the subject matters that he does on this record with with any more tact than a lot of other rappers have which is an arena that for j-rock I'm sure is difficult to not only step in but also keep away from keep away from because your label mate Kendrick just released one of the most significant records of all time when it comes to dealing with these sort of issues but simultaneously your cohorts are kind of dealing in these issues in a lot of different ways in their music I imagine the temptation to reflect in your music is there as well I think TDE has created this new wave of interest in conscious hip-hop j-rock tried to I guess answer that call answer that demand a little bit on this record and it just resulted in a very soft on exciting album though I do like a lot of the songs on here individually and overall the record itself wasn't that bad it was decent I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this record of listen I hope you have and if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should take a listen to next and then review in a video and that's it Anthony Fantana j-rock 9mm nine 
zfnPiWbGacg,ah she scratched an O here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the numeric er record M this is the debut full-length record of black metal songstress Amelie run also known for the vocals that she has lent to the Danish indie pop project minks also her own solo records which aren't exactly black metal either so you know black metal has got to be hot if this artist is coming out of nowhere just being like man I'm coming out with a black metal record and obviously her involvement in the genre has been very recent but she had a breakout EP on relapse records not too long ago which had some bright spots on it had some interesting moments though I thought the songwriting was a little disorganized kind of disheveled however this EP showed a lot of promise and the project showed even more promise as a full-length album was announced and it seemed like quite a few black metal elites we're going to be ending up on the record providing instrumentation like Telok and Henner Jorgensen and Christopher Rigg of / and many many more and together with Brun on this record they create a pretty awesome variety of sounds just very well crafted sounds I think this is a very vibrant record as far as its sonic qualities very few black metal debut albums come out sounding this good I mean the production quality on this record I think much of the time is a pretty high there are some beautiful multitrack vocals all over this thing amélie's solo vocal parts on on this record sound pretty great and even her retched her screamed vocals on this thing ur are kind of a bone showing the more aggressive guitar passages on this thing aren't really that bad either when we get those wretched vocals and we get those more aggressive guitar passages the production takes a little bit of a turn kind of a bit of a nod to that very low fine necro style of black metal production from back in the day it's not a perfect recreation or anything like that but things just take a grimy er tone some of the musical passages on this record take kind of a full ketone there are also some very vibrant in illest rias string sections on this record - which have a bit of a classical vibe again a lot of bases covered on this relatively short record standing at like 37 minutes there are a lot of elements going into these songs going into this record the issue though is that a lot of the time they're kind of weakly orchestrated many tracks in the track listing here sound kind of unfinished or just fade out suddenly sort of like the song more debt or the tracks will all of a sudden introduce these instrumental shifts or changes that don't really complement the previous musical passages at all it just kind of feels like the music is trying to cover up a bridge to nowhere just a lack of ideas as to where to progress a certain part which i think is kind of evident on the introductory track here which is for the first 3/4 of it it's a really coherent song but then all of a sudden these strings come in and just smother the track until they just fade the song out on the song owned born they do the same thing and it doesn't sound like it's on purpose it doesn't sound like a mindful compositional choice like oh I know it would be good if we just introduced this other instrumentation from out of nowhere and then just fade out the song although I guess I sort of understand why they would do this on some of the tracks for the songs on here that do feel a little more strung out things tend to lose steam pretty fast sort of like on the song dip ice Kovan which i think aesthetically is a pretty beautiful track kind of sounds like dream metal but everything about it just kind of loses flavor after a little while and the fifth cut and the track listing here sort of has this issue going on with the booming drums kicking the whole record off which sounds like I don't know the compression just has them crushing the guitars like it doesn't sound together with the other instrumentation it just sounds like it's kind of hulking over and shoving it out of the way rather than kind of finding a nice balance or a nice spot for it in the mix which at times I kind of feel like the vocals a very close connection to a lot of the guitars and the drums to kind of soaring so high above all of them mixed with so much volume that they're not really slid into the instrumental as much as they're just kind of sitting on top of it very coldly and the vocal solos on this record kind of the small detour ish tracks that are backed usually with piano on this album some of these tracks are the most coherent and beautiful moments on the entire record but there are so many of them that after a while they kind of end up feeling like a distraction from what should actually be the meat of the record the most entertaining part of the record the metal songs of which I think there are a few on here like the song more debt or the song heaven and moments where while maybe I'm not in love with the ending the various transitions that occur along these tracks certainly feel bit sharper and a little bit better put together than on a lot of the songs here overall I don't think this is a bad record I thought I had a lot of good things going on with it's just the writing is a little weak and I think that makes it so that there's a lot of room for improvement here I hope that Brun and her guests are able to build a stronger songwriting foundation to sort of tower all their instrumentation on top of I'm feeling a light 2ds and six on this thing transition have you given this record of listen if you have what you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that is it y'all anthony Fantana em forever 
XkfXO6fpuIk,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and we're doing another final update where I just kind of let you guys in on my record collection over here but we're not really doing any new records coming into the collection in in this video we're actually in a few videos going to be diving into my seven inches we are getting sexy in here yes that's right I keep them down here right down there before we get fully into this vinyl update I do want to say that this vinyl update is here it is sponsored by the good people over vinyl II please they are a monthly vinyl Club where you get exclusive pressings of new and old and classic records sent to your front door in the mail that has me numerous fantastic records over these past months as they have with many of their subscribers and subscriptions with them also gives you access to an exclusive store and there are a lot of other perks to head down to a link in the description or you can essentially read up on vinyl me please and sort of see if it is the monthly vinyl subscription service for you on with the 7-inch vinyl update so I'm just gonna you know pull some of them up and we're gonna take this a few videos at a time because the 7 inches there's a few of them there's quite a few of them alright let's let's start off the first one we have here is a place to bury strangers keep slipping away if you're looking for a little dark moody post-punk II noise rock music with some sweet hooks give a listen to this single a place to bury strangers proudly sitting in the record collection of mine over in the seven-inch section this is this is a very nice single on my favorite disco singles when I favor pop singles right here we haven't and Atlanta Records and Atlantic Records single duh Anthony duh from ABBA Fernando can your hair are the Robins like just are they even drums in that song I really don't know but Fernando man Fernando it's it's it's a classic little tune so ABBA I actually do enjoy Abba quite a bit I love me some ABBA shamelessly so great we're moving on to a few 7 inches from against me back when I enjoyed them so much more this isn't actually a - really good little seven inches over here this isn't so much an acoustic seven-inch but it's like five Chavez tracks or so now it's four tracks some of which end up landing on reinventing Axl Rose in my opinion their best record but there's kind of like a bit more of a raw recording here especially with the I love the rendition of I still love you Julie on this track anyway and this is an acoustic 7-inch of some of their tracks I love reinventing Axl Rose and we did it all for Don I love their renditions of of those tracks on this acoustic EP so we have two little sweet little seven inches from against me there and I believe that the little 7-inch art over here is pretty cool although it's not really oh yeah there's a little card in here that's what I remember a lyric card isn't that sweet a little lyric card in there would be against me seven inch crimes or crime and I haven't as forgiven by against me that's funny haven't haven't really I don't think I've played any of these seven inches for a while man I I often find myself just kind of playing my LPS a lot of the time you know seven inches I kind of play them a little bit you know when I first get them and then and then they kind of fall to the wayside for me and this is kind of reminding me maybe I should be playing some of these more especially these ones I've got a few cool ones over here from the Anamanaguchi boys we have a split over here between Anamanaguchi and Starscream over here the a side with automatic Gucci on it has one of my favourite Anamanaguchi songs my skateboard will go on and the Starscream strap track on the other side is a shred the know her into the stars if you're looking for like some pop punk 8-bit  give a little thing it's a nice white 7-inch oh yeah give a listen to this thing sold out guys sold out but you can you know look it up on the internet but shout out to the automatic Gucci guys for being solid dudes who I'm really anticipating their forthcoming record could be really that they were so young they were so young in that picture they were so young and I love this this is uh their little seven-inch it's clear they're a little 7 inch for track airbrushed and on the on the b-side it's a remix of the track and what's so cool this is a 34 this is number 35 of 300 and it's a little hologram little hologram that's so cool that's so cool a little hologram 7-inch there that's amazing had to cap it this was a great seven-inch though I didn't really love the LP that this band came out with I thought they came out with a few good singles namely this song meet me in the city maybe in this is a really fun song from the babies featuring members of Vivian girls and woods coming together for a debrief little you know simple 7-inch in a very plain white card you know nothing too flashy here but the song itself is is really good so I can't you know I can't follow that no complaints about that no complaints about a good song on a 45 you know what I'm saying little uh I don't know at a garage punk garage rock kind of thing going on little loaf I - it's a good track the babies made me in the city look it up this is a great little 7-inch - I wish this ban took it farther than they did but you know the Soudan it is still good Balkans a d2v beside cave this was a little it's a little punky I would say this track but it's got a bit of an indie flavor to kind of stroke strokes ish but a little harder if I recall correctly and the performances on this on the 7-inch and they're just they're full-length LP that they came out with later are really tight really tight playing point so a Balkans a d2v cave alright this is a bunch of seven inches in one sleeve and the reason that there are so many seven inches in one sleeve is that these are all my beetle seven inches of numerous beetles seven inches the beetles eight days a week classical pop tune right there The Beatles Ballad of John and Yoko old brown shoe on the other side Yoko Ono and the band looking sweet on the on the cover they're looking cute we also have the Beatles don't let me down and get back back very nice on we have oh this one's a this one's an oldie but a goodie we have the Beatles covering twist and shout on here that's pretty nice and somebody on the sleeve here somebody was doing some math sometimes tables 17 times three let's see if this math let's see if this math adds up 17 times 3 3 times 7 21 carry the 2 yeah three times yeah yeah it's 51 ok the math is so the math is sound when you buy some of these old 7 inches you know people write their names on them people write all sorts of stuff on there and also on the sleeve it says $8 great country Hank Williams sound alike I don't know that seems kind of like an an inaccurate description of the Beatles but we'll let it slide we also have the Beatles love me do and PS I love you we have the Beatles with one of my favorite songs of theirs love this track it's a George Harrison song and it's off of have you Road something one of the best love songs of all time [Music] something in the way she moves looks a little dusty oh it's a lot dusty I'm gonna clean this off and come together on the other side that's wonderful and it seems that I have two copies of get back and don't let me down so maybe we can do a giveaway or something since I have two copies of that and I did not realize until now which again sort of illustrates how rarely it is that I am going into these singles but I I love that we're getting together to do it and that that were we're venturing into this rarely explored section of the Fantana record collection which is why you know well it's taken me so long to do these these seven inches in a video yeah dust dust a lot of these seven inches are much older than the rest of my collection all right here is another disco group that I love the Bee Gees you should be dancing love the Bee Gees love some Bee Gees singles the Bee Gees were fantastic Abba was fantastic can't complain about the Bee Gees and actually I can't I remember I didn't really mind the the b-side on here tube subway I thought that that I thought that was a good b-side I need to hear it again - totally recall it but I do remember in my head really liking that b-side I mean I have another BG single over here for Biba Kenton just loved those disco tunes can't get enough of them can't get enough of them oh oh oh oh yeah oh yeah okay this is a nice one this is a nice one got Chuck Berry over here Chuck Berry Chuck Chuck on Chess Records with reelin and rockin and we also got a sweet little sixteen who can complain about that 7-inch that's a wonderful couple of tracks wonderful couple of old school rock and roll tracks rock classics Chuck Berry look up Chuck bear if you don't know the Chuck Berry is what are you doing you're failing of life and we also have a Fats Domino over here with Blueberry Hill and bow we've all can't complain about that 7-inch either that's why I got it yeah man I'm not playing these seven inches enough got some good tracks in here holy all right over here I got a little hardcore 7-inch that I think was passed to me by the guys over at a red scroll records I believe shout out to them as always and this is a seven inch brass caskets brass caskets really like some heavy dark stuff if I remember correctly but again I would need to uh I would need to revisit it and try it out to sort of get a full get a full grip dark sort of xeroxed sheet in here looks like some lyrics or something actually ominous weird imagery on here some kind of letter from the Ministry of Truth with the Illuminati I in the corner maybe this 7-inch is a recording device that the Illuminati is using to spy on me that's possibility as well as long as we're getting conspiratorial looks like we got a few Johnny Cash singles over here in a sleeve okay here we go now we're cooking with gas cooking with some gas here we have Johnny Cash with the song big river on Sun Records look up Sun Records there's there's and we have Ballad of a teenage Queen on the other side and finally we have Johnny Cash with let's see this side of the law that is I see though this says radio station copy uh-oh illegal illegal the side of the law on the b-side and then we have on the a side flesh and blood some classic country right there and I would say that would that would make it for this here vinyl video okay we will make another vinyl video soon getting closer to the end of the seven inch section I think we did pretty good we went from a to Johnny Cash that's I'd say I said we made some good progress over there and we have more over here more down there's so much more to cover but yeah we're gonna get through all these seven inches over here and then the seven inches will have been covered and then once that's that's kind of done maybe you know somewhere seven inches we'll start making their way into the vinyl updates because maybe I'll start you know paying attention more to that sort of side of things I really should I really should all right that's it Anthony Fantino vinyl update forever [Music] [Music]

Rob Scallon on the show how're you doing Rob everybody doing good thanks for having me Anthony I will link all of you to Rob's YouTube channel down in the description box if you don't know Rob is a fantastic guitarist really a YouTube's preeminent sort of guitarist virtuoso just a man of many many six string talents actually you know he's got quite a few stringed instruments inside of his place all of which you can catch in many of his videos where he delivers originals covers even did a reverse Black Sabbath cover which was probably one of most insane things I'd ever seen on the Internet I love how the internet sort of provides a place where you could do something so whacked out that normally you'd probably have a hard time getting a lot of people on board to support you in doing such a thing what's particularly ridiculous and yeah thanks thanks for the intro by the way no problem it was well deserved I just tell people I play guitar for the internet you should you should pay me to hang around you all the time and spent reduce you to people for you yeah my name is Rob and I'll handle the rest you know yeah exactly well uh so let me ask is is is is YouTube right now the content you're creating your music stuff is that your full-time gig now or coming close to your full-time gig at the moment yeah yeah no this has been my full-time job for a little over two years now right around previous to this I had I had quite a few other jobs but previous to this I was mainly working at a library and then once I hit around 35,000 subscribers I was able to make enough to where I was able to barely live off of it not usually the the subscriber number that a lot of people you know sort of see themselves going full-time on YouTube though were your videos like kind of going viral around that time like were you getting a lot of views or that outweighed the subscriber numbers that you had no not really it was more of at that point it was more of a risk and I had some projects coming up later that I figured would you know could possibly bring me into that room to where I could make a comfortable living off of it but certainly at thirty five thousand subscribers was not a comfortable living at all but I saved up a good amount of money four years past that to where I could coast for a while and I figured that I unless unless I was putting all of my time into it I couldn't really expect my channel to grow very much yeah um so no I thirty-five thousand subscribers wasn't really a living wage for me but it was close and and then I was able to really dive in and start doing it more and I've always been like really in tune with the business side of things to like that's also kind of other than just something I have to do it's also kind of a hobby and something I enjoy so at that point I had a good amount of revenue streams in place and none of them were anything super significant but when you put them together they were at least enough to where I knew I could almost get by and then do the rest of my savings yeah that's kind of the thing with content creating online you kind of can't just rely on the money coming from the ad revenue that you to know you know sort of make from your videos so you've got to have a lot of different irons in the fire absolutely yeah like if you're if you're relying strictly on Adsense you either need to be well you first off to make a living off that you need to be mega popular you've got to be Tyler Oakley yeah or like I'm good like PewDiePie either that's we hear a lot of course you know if for a channel like his you know it's definitely significant but for most people overwhelmingly it's not but but yeah even if even if you are really hyper ly successful on YouTube and you're relying just on Adsense you know that's that's pretty unstable you know if your popularity goes down a little bit like so does your income sure absolutely and you know especially for someone like you who you know you're trying to make videos that sort of have this wide appeal but are also you know very shareable very creative and and some videos you know like that Sandman video that you did sort of ended up just being wildly popular and just really took off whereas some of your other videos you know don't see quite as few shares and you know you've got us kind of it's it's a bit of a shot in the dark all the time you know I always find your videos entertaining as a fan but you know even I as a fan can't really predict like oh this video is going to go totally viral or this video you know so so you know you're kind of I guess at the mercy of whether or not your fans want to share your content with their friends a little bit when you're coming out with new stuff so you've got to have other kind of other other projects kind of on the back burner to kind of get your hardcore fans Lou into that so you can just kind of keep things going yeah yeah absolutely I mean at least for my channel to expect every video to go into the millions is just not realistic at all so and if I was relying strictly on Adsense that that would be what I was doing or what I would have to do every video would need to be this like big million hit video and yeah of course that's very unrealistic or if if that was kind of the position that you were in or the position that you were putting yourself in are there limitations that you feel like you would need to put on your artistic process or your creative process in some of these videos to kind of keep those numbers up I guess yeah I would say so because if I was if I needed every video to be this big viral thing which wouldn't be what I wouldn't be comfortable doing it that at all just like on a stress level wish I would just have her a regular part-time job and do it on the side but yeah if I did then I would definitely spend a whole lot less I would have to spend a whole lot less time doing like original work which doesn't go viral but that stuff I mean you know just as more interested in so yeah it would very much change my creative process if I was doing that route as far as your original work goes I feel like as a YouTube musician or somebody who's I guess known more for their musicianship on YouTube than in kind of their solo stuff and you know how exactly do you balance those two kinds of worlds because when I when I listen to your solo work I hear some very beautiful melodic very serious music but then on the YouTube side of things and you have put your originals up on your YouTube channel things tend to run a little bit more lighthearted and you know just silly and playful but still like creative and and and out there I kind of feel like as a YouTube musician maybe you kind of have this freedom to break away from seriousness that some other rock musicians or musicians who are kind of deep into the music industry don't necessarily have yeah yeah that is something I'm really fortunate for like as a YouTube musician I can pretty much do whatever I want and as long as there's you know a good amount of people that are also into it I can continue doing it and that's really great I don't think I would want to I mean if if that was my only option you know it's definitely better than other things I could be doing with my life but if I had to just do like just to quote unquote serious stuff or just to quote unquote comedy stuff I wouldn't be very fulfilled doing whatever like I really enjoy switching around all the time you know I wouldn't to do all originals or do all comedy stuff Cheryl so yeah what we're really fortunate in that way and that we work in a we have a creative job but also one that isn't fair you you know isn't very limiting being on YouTube I can move around to a bunch of different things and I'm just a sort of thinking about the the kind of interesting world that that you thrive in business-wise because it seems like you and a lot of other YouTube musicians out there have tons and tons and tons of fans and but there's like this really grave lack of acknowledgement from the traditional music industry and the thing is you you have you have label reps that are trying to sling the latest records from you know the newest pop star who they're trying to make a hit who if you accumulated all of their fans they probably have much less listeners than you and a lot of other people on YouTube who some of these A&R people are completely deaf to it's it's just kind of a weird it's it just kind of seems like a weird thing it's sort of like how a traditional TV and media ignores you know what youtubers are doing as far as like you know dramas and comedies and sketch comedy and all that yeah I think in a lot of ways the tradition you know quote-unquote traditional media hasn't really caught up yet and they might really like to believe that the internet creators are somehow a legitimate when they're not but I don't know yeah it's an interesting exciting world to be in you know I don't I don't have any or I have very very a very very small amount of interest in doing anything in the traditional music industry you know the internet is where I want to be and and yet that that whole other world doesn't really interest me at all you're talking about how uh you know traditional media is and really catching up with what YouTube is doing is that a wall that you see breaking down eventually or do you think these kinds of world the these two worlds are always going to be separate in some kind of way yeah well I think they have to they're gonna have to know and and now they're starting to and it'll be interesting to see where it goes but pretty soon I mean almost all media it's going to be online media so I think they're gonna have to adapt but it'll be interesting to see see where it goes but at least for now um online creators aren't taking quite as seriously as if they were you know traditional whatever it's kind of weird to see what traditional I guess bits of media are taking online creator seriously though because and even I've had this I mean numerous youtubers have come out with books I don't know what it is about being a youtuber that makes book companies be like let's get these people to make books you know but it's so weird that those two come together like books super traditional and old square they're the ones that are like really catching they're actually reaching across the aisle meanwhile the TV execs are like hell no we're not putting any of these people on TV yeah it's it's that is really odd and it's I even I tweeted recently that hey I'm coming out with a book and I I said something like no I just wanted to be part of the club but you know I just figured out I wasn't a youtuber yet until I come out with a book but yeah yeah that is funny there I mean tons of youtubers are coming out with books yeah it's a huge thing as a musician you know who is is voluntarily kind of working outside of this traditional you know kind of a music industry world and not that I'm asking you to sort of name names here or anything but you live in Chicago you know we're quite a few you know successful musicians who have gone down that Avenue live and you know I'm sure that you play out quite a bit and people have seen you play and recognize your talent do you ever sort of cross paths with people who are kind of in that industry and you know is there any kind of like weirdness or animosity there or kind of lack of understanding for what you're doing or for what they're doing well well actually I don't ever play out in Chicago oh really ever yeah I mean the only time I played a show in Chicago as a solo artists I played recent I play with Driftless Pony yeah I was gonna say that yeah so like we played a show in Chicago where I just opened up for them and I play drums for them at Reggie's and then for the last word because awesome we played the Metro which was a ton of fun but other than those two occurrences in the last like five six years I never play out so so just know I'm just not in tune with that world really at all now is that just something that you're not interested in or because of the multiple irons that you have in the fire that's just not something you even really need to do it's kind of a mix of both a big part of it too is I'm just not interested in playing live as a solo artist unless I'm playing with my friends like with tour because awesome for example or with Driftless Pony Club that's a ton of fun but I don't really have any interest in like going out and bringing all my equipment to a venue and setting up by myself playing by myself leaving by myself just as a solo artist like that doesn't sound that fun to me and it's not it and and as you said being a lot of irons in the fire if you will or having a lives there's other other revenue streams or things that are taking up my time I don't really have time for it mm-hmm and it's just not yeah playing live just isn't something I'm that interested in and with my stuff too I kind of how I work is all for a week or a month or whatever it is I'll just focus on one song that I'm writing one video and then once it's done I don't play it ever again so for so for me to start playing live again I would need to relearn like all of my songs that I would want to play live yeah because you know recording recording is one thing but sort of learning to perform what you're writing is is another beast yeah totally it's it's a it's a completely other thing that I'm just I'm not that interested in and I don't think I would really enjoy all that much maybe later on down the line if I have a bigger audience where I can tour the country and do with my friends that would be great I get to do that with tour because awesome which is fantastic and it's a ton of fun hmm but it's not something I'm interested in well that's kind of interesting because I mean really the the resounding consensus around the campfire pretty much with every music industry person who I talked to or I hear writing some kind of think piece is that no artist is making money off their music anymore you can't sell your music everybody's you know nobody's making money off of being creative everybody's making money off of merch and touring and you're obviously not touring and murchison of the things that you do so it's actually not even in the merch really I would love to be in the March game but it's just not something I've ever been able I've never put together any merchandise that I've been excited about and then as a solo artist where I use my own name it's kind of weird to just like put my name on things like I don't really feel comfortable doing that like if I had an alias or something you know that would be one thing but to just I don't know put my name on things I think would be weird well I mean it doesn't even have to be your name it could be your bright shining smiling face just like with a thumbs up or something yeah exactly I know I know that there there is merch opportunities like a lot of a lot of other youtubers that's like their main source of income yeah and certainly with you know traditional music it is but it's just never I would love to do it and if I had things that I was really excited about I would love to do it I think much for me going forward my version of merch is more signature gear I have a signature guitar that me and Chapman guitars are working on right now that I'm super excited about and like maybe custom pedals or custom picks like that stuff might be my version of March if that gets rolling well you did an interesting thing where I think after an original track that you had put out and you dropped a video for it you had a framed the strings that were on the guitar yeah you were playing yeah that was fun so and I think it's cool now to know that anchors probably you know out of my originals at least one of my most popular tracks and to know that the strings that were actually on the recording are you know framed and hanging up in people's houses all over the world is really cool and and and it was kind of it was my version of a physical release like because I didn't do CDs for that EP yet into finals or anything so people want to own the music I think this is as close as you could get to it you're actually owning the thing that made the sound to begin with I think what you actually need to do is respite dozens of packs of guitar strings just put them on your guitar play the song once and then pack them up and then play the song once on a new set of strings you like each set of strings I send you this song has been played on them I swear to you you know and then just shoot a video of you just like marathon playing this song on each set of strings I think that I think it's more about which one is on the recording but not just like which one's happened to play the song at one point hey if you do that and it sells pretty soon you'll just be able to start selling your own sweat this is the sweat that is from the blood sweat and tears physically that went into this recording yes here's the sweat generated during playing the song a hundred times on a hundred different set of strings thank God he scrape off the skin follicles of the string absolutely and that'd be weird so so other other than that I would like to do merchants going forward and the signature guitar holy crap I'm so excited about like I have to stop myself from thinking about it sometimes or else I get so excited that it's it's hard to do anything else isolate I definitely want to come back to that and talk about you know some of the music that kind of inspires you as well but but I got a few more questions about you know just like you know you as a youtuber I'm thinking of where do you kind of see your videos and you're in your original music kind of progressing into the future I just kind of feel like you've got so much to be conscious of and an artists especially in the traditional music industry are so conscious about where their sound is kind of going next are you as focused or is worried about that kind of thing or you know do you feel like you're just kind of able to I don't know just allow ideas to naturally pop into your head and you know you're not so much worried about a narrative or a progression to your music or anything like that yeah I would say you know what you I'd rather just what I'm interested in and what ideas just naturally come to me or what I work on what I'm going to work on I think back again on us being youtubers are really fortunate and that usually you just start your channel because it's something you're really into and you're just making stuff that you joy and then along the way you know if you're if you work at it you're also really fortunate enough you find a lot of other people that are into the same things and hopefully I mean my thought is I just continue to work on things that I'm interested in and my audience is similar enough to me to where they're all they'll also find interest in it and I think that's at least for me I think that's the best way to go about it I think once I start spending too much time making things that I just think will do well and once I'm not interested in them that really comes across in the videos so so yeah I think just what naturally comes to me is what I think I should be working on all right so so moving on to uh ya know it does and moving on to this whole guitar business when kind of crafting a custom guitar kind of I imagine in the process of doing so you know you're trying to make a guitar that you really want to hear and that you yourself you really want to play mm-hmm what is it about the sound of a certain guitar that kind of you know really grabs your attention or just like you know really picks your ear up and and really just kind of registers to you is like a really good quality amazing guitar sound what is it in the the sound of a guitar that that you sort of look for when you're playing guitars when you're hearing other people play guitars you know I personally do have kind of my my favorites and my least favorites as far as like the major kinds of guitar brands go but you know what where you kind of seen yourself gravitate over the years geez well and in this case I think something a little bit different and in this case what's different about it that it's an eight-string we're doing an H string on a 16 version and I guess the main thing I look for at least in a signature like I play a lot of different instruments and depending on the genre you know of course I'll gravitate towards different instruments that are more geared towards that genre when it comes to the signature I really want something that can be versatile so and which is a little bit different with a regular signature so I guess I I would like to see it played in a whole lot of different ways and in that case we're making it to where it it can do that like it I can't go actually into the specs of the guitar so it this one's a hard one to answer and that we've all decided that we don't want to talk about the specs of the guitar yet because we might want them to change later okay that totally makes sense yeah so why not I've hurt you play some of those Chapman guitars on your on your videos before and they seem to have just like a really really soon / clean ringing quality to them just like a really just very pristine sound to them not a whole lot of you know a dirt or grit or anything like that they're just like SuperDuper it's it's like listening to glass yeah and that's what I like about them you know that you can take that and then use effects or whatever to bring it at any direction so you get this really clean di sound they can do a lot with and I'm trying to not talk about specific specs about this one mm-hmm but yeah like I have a for the age thing I can't talk about this like a lot of age strings at least in the market where they're not super expensive you're always gonna find an atrium that's specifically geared towards metal and it looks metal and it's that all that everything inside of it is made for super distorted tones and we wanted to make something that hopefully will appear to a market of people that want to use this extended range to do things other than that you know also can do that well but can do a lot of other things it seems like metal is a big influence for you sometimes though yeah yeah it is and it's going it it will gent but but it will also do other things yeah certain certainly gent which you which I in your videos before you have consciously poked fun at but yeah I think this is something also simultaneously that you enjoy oh absolutely yeah absolutely Hydra that stuff a lot and most of what I if you say I make fun of stuff there are things that I'm a fan of hmm but I I just think it's fun to not take it too seriously and also I don't know point out some of the funny things about it yeah it's it definitely seems like it comes from a place of fandom which i think is why places like metal sucks like love the shit out of your videos mm-hmm like yeah anything that's metal related they post it right away yeah they've been really good to me yeah like metal stocks and metal injection yeah good to me I think the next one I'm working on I think they'll they'll post as well as an it's what I'm currently working on I'm really excited about it's another thing I like post kind of pokes fun at Ghent but in a loving way mm-hmm it also seems like certainly math rock is like a point of inspiration for you too yeah talking about these genres can you you know maybe sort of uh I I think some of your influences in the metal world like Metallica and Slayer you know uh are very clear you know coming through in your videos but are there any sort of other artists you know big or small who you haven't directly covered or referenced in your videos that you would consider yourself to be a big fan of yeah I think the most the the biggest example for me and I would say the biggest inspiration musically of my whole life would be Primus hmm and I've never done a Primus song or or ever really any video that mentioned them directly but overall that they would be my biggest musical influence I got really into them in middle school I actually first started the first band that I was like obsessed with was Metallica in middle school hmm but then quickly after that it went on to Primus and then that was a whole other thing and once I got into them was like alright I need to be a musician I need to go buy a bass I need to figure out how to play like us play you started with the bass yeah yeah that was a person yeah but that would that that band would make you want to play bass yeah yeah I and what really interests me about that man and and this I think for me comes across certainly in what I do though it's not quite as obvious is that they played their instruments in really weird ways sure and really different ways and had different instruments and they made incredible music videos that were really out there oh yeah so those two things I was really really interested in and prior to that I'd kind of dabbled with music like we had a drum set my brother and I but it was kind of a hobby but after getting really into promised I needed to learn how to play string instruments and well also that Primus is is easily one of the funniest rock bands on the planet and and and you certainly have seen to find a balance between you know your own take on musicianship your own take on virtuosity as well as your own take on comedy I mean you know you don't play like someone who's a huge Primus fan and you don't have the same type of sense of humor but you found a balance between those things - yeah there's a pretty thick layer of humor in what they do and certainly what I do though it's very it's very different oh yeah absolutely and and like you know for the record that was definitely a band I was obsessed with oh yeah late high school early college as well I think there was a at one point I owned every one of their records up to anti-pop and and and yeah even some les claypool like solo CDs - yeah all those the biggest thing did you have the DVD animals should not try to act like people oh no I did not have that but I had like some III had pirated a few videos off of it because that was kind of the that was the Golden Age of that - you know sort of downloading stuff off of person person yeah irony would take like eight hours for yes five minute video okay great we're both incriminating ourselves in this podcast good guy yeah well that that was like the early YouTube is going i remember going over to my friend Nick's house and we would he would just find all these music videos and we would have to cue up like okay we want to watch this one this one in this one we would queue it up and then leave and then come back and by that time you know like you know I have power later most likely they would be downloaded and and we've watched him a ton one of them was I remember Warren Samba by Slayer we watched that one of Julian times and try to learn it and uh at that time it was I'm sure what we were playing sounded horrible but we we tried our best but but yeah when I say I got really into Primus I even more specifically meant I got really into that animals should not try to act like people DVD hmm point were like my friends and I especially my friend Jonathan it was really like a to the point we it was probably unhealthy how into Primus he was we would we even go as far as to memorize the commentary like we would be hanging out riding our bikes or something and we would be able to recite big parts of just the commentary unlike some of the b-side videos it was it was a huge part of our life I'm sure the guys at prime minister probably not that I don't know if they they've ever stumbled across me but I'm sure they would they've probably heard that a million times they're like yeah yeah we know you know we influence you and everyone else no it's true it's it's it's interesting just how much like weird kooky rock music they made in the 90s and in the 2000s that influenced quite a few people but they yeah in the in the long run they haven't seemed to have I guess held as much critical acclaim as as I thought they would have er I would have liked them to and and I think it weirdly enough it just kind of comes with the territory of I think just being a band with a strong sense of humor for whatever reason no matter how good you play it seems like people are just gonna take you less seriously generally if if you're throwing jokes into your songs yeah that's probably true but but you know that's that's more of a rant than it is a question and I think just in that I just think in their specific genre of being I don't know if you use this term before book but we would at the time it's kind of musicians music hmm no and I think that genre is is it is limiting once you if you try to think I'm like a mainstream scale like you can have a lot of really really fans that are really really dedicated but having a tremendous amount of fans that are somewhat dedicated is it seems like there's kind of a glass wall there mm-hm okay that's that's an interesting it's an interesting term and an interesting Avenue to go down in your opinion what is it that makes something musicians music because I don't know if it comes strictly down to virtuosity you know I mean lots of now I don't think anybody would refer to something like Pink Floyd to be musicians music you know yeah but but they're one of the most significant progressive rock bands ever and I don't know I mean Rush rushes music is quite flashy and a lot of musicians are hardcore into them I mean you're talking about one of the bands that has three of the best musicians on their respective instruments ever in one group but I don't think anybody would refer to Rush is just simply musicians music but for Primus though that I guess that term seems a little fitting yeah well I think it's not only that I don't think you would get that term by just being incredible at your instruments mmm but being incredible at your instruments in a way that doesn't appeal to a mainstream audience I feel like maybe I'm wrong about this you know I could totally be wrong about this but you you could be wrong I'm just asking for your opinion on it yeah yeah but I think with Primus it's a certain type of genre that maybe you you have to play to totally appreciate like it's a little bit of off the path to where if you if you didn't have that type of background I think if music wasn't that big a part of your life you might not appreciate it that that's I don't know ai ai ai ai ai ai ai think I hear what you're getting at I mean it's it's there's great playing out of Primus record but the way that they play their instruments doesn't sound traditional in any exact in any kind of sense yeah so it is kind of a weird and abrasive and not gonna appeal to a super mainstream audience like I think rush or Pink Floyd would sure absolutely or I get you know I guess what you could also say you know a guy like bucket head would be serving musicians music it's it's time that it's musicians music but it's musician nerd music like I'm so good at your instrument that like just playing it normally absolutely bores you and you're like I want to find out a way or I want to hear other musicians playing this guitar here in a really weird way and and and then once you're kind of pushing it to the point where the the the instrument is no longer making you know just regular sounds you you're gonna start to turn people off but you know by that same token you have some bands that do that but they get lumped into that noise rock category and and somehow end up getting that critical acclaim and you know and in that that long-term sort of I guess classic denomination like a band like Sonic Youth or something mm-hmm yeah so there's just so many factors to go into it's hard to pinpoint what would what would make something only appeal to musicians yeah yeah it's it's it's true and and you know and and that's the thing I mean Sonic Youth is definitely example of a group who don't play their instruments in a particularly traditional way at all but you know rarely do I ever hear you know guitar virtuosos talking up Sonic Youth and you know in fact I mean when I have talked with those people they don't seem to take the playing of a guy like Thurston Moore all that seriously because while it is avant-garde I don't think that I mean you could obviously you know look at what he's doing and see that it's not studied in the same way that a guy like bucketheads playing is very studied and and very you know honed and very practiced you know it seems like Thurston is more in it for just the the texture of what he's doing rather than just kind of the virtuosity of it mm-hmm yeah and that will of course you'll do a more mainstream audience I have kind of a funny story about Buckethead sure well kind of somewhat the first concert I saw was C 2 B 3 which was Bukka dead at the Metro in Chicago mm-hm and then I think it was maybe my second concert I went to the Metro again in Chicago to see Buckethead and recently on on tour with tour because awesome we got to play the Metro and it was we sold more tickets to that show than anywhere else which was really gratifying and I went in there and I I was talking to the sound guys like yeah my first concert was here and it's really cool to play here again like oh that's awesome like yes I saw a bucket head here and then immediately he was like he was like judging me super hard and stopped talking to me apparently it's not because what you like bucket head yeah and also I guess the sound guy at the metro does not like bucket at all like he was he was it was really offended that I was happy to play in the same place that fucking head again dude it's your it's your venue yeah you let him play here yeah but I he seemed he seemed offended that that's why I liked the Metro ok well that you know but that's that's the thing though I mean um there's there's definitely a stigma sometimes when people can just play their instruments super duper well at which which I'm sure that you've experienced I'm not I'm not quite sure what you mean by that I think in this case I heard him later mumbling about Guns and Roses I think it was a really big Guns'n'Roses fan okay so that might be why he took it personally maybe and I'm not too familiar with Guns and Roses I knew that I know that Buckethead was in it at one point yeah III think I think you know it might have to do with like loyalty to slash or something like that I have no idea yeah maybe his you know is his whole life he grew up idolizing slash and that's that's what I ended in slashes replacement and and as far as as far as the stigma that I'm talking about I mean it's not really that strong or I guess it sort of depends on what circles you hang in and I think it I don't I don't think somebody who's doing what you do would kind of run into it all that often I think it sort of depends on what you're famous for and kind of a kind of at what level of popularity you're at like I see a guy like Steve Vai kind of cast off very often is just being this guy who you know just plays this is very noodley soulless guitar solos that don't really mean or amount to anything he's just like you know basically masturbating on stage but he's doing it with a guitar you know and every just like oh yeah Wow I know the criticism you're talking about another extreme example would be Michael Angelo Batio sure yeah he's probably the most extreme example or like Yngwie Malmsteen where where people have that like oh it's just he's just showing off the whole time it's not musical or whatever but I mean yeah I think most people won't be into that type of noodley stuff but some people are and and I do think that even if it is just like doing tricks on your instrument I certainly think there's value in that you know it's it's a show and if you're if you're into guitars you you might be interested in watching someone do a lot of tricks on it you know I mean if you're a guitar player kind of watching people execute at that really high level of performance can be really can be really entertaining you know and I think it's it's like we were saying earlier you know performance is really you know kind of a different beast you know there's a lot of people I think probably on a smaller scale could do a lot of the stuff that you know Steve I could do and I'm sure that you could pull off some of that stuff as well that's sort of you know man knowing that you could jump on stage and just do it all so flawlessly like with absolutely no breaks in between all of the things that you're doing is is really daunting yeah I I would stressed me out to perform like that there's so many notes to miss well I mean you know if you break a sweat you could just do like Steve Vai and have a bunch of fans at the front of the stage so that it's blowing your beautiful hair backwards behind your head as you're just like executing these awesome guitar moves isn't there what's that there's that band Steel Panther that kind of parodied like that type of mentality mm-hmm and well not in so much and like always shredding but like they'll have fans on stage and just like super egotistical I frankly don't know too much about Steve I honestly so I you really can't comment on his stuff I'm not that familiar I know he's he's pretty flashy I mean in the I don't know his early early history but kind of his first big break was that back-in-the-day frank zappa would would use him to transcribe his guitar solos in his writing so that it could either be worked into sort of a larger more classical type composition or so that you know it could kind of maybe even be marked down for like a recording that he was working on a rock recording interesting that's how he got into the industry is he I believe that was his first big first big break he's actually been invited multiple times at least during the first one because I caught it too that zappa plays zappa tour and I believe that he was instrumental in making sure that his Zappa's son on that tour was up to snuff when it came to performing a lot of his dad's guitar parts and solos and you know and he was there on stage to you know play in these tracks you know so there is kind of that that big Zappa connection with a Steve Vai and had no idea that you and knew him oh yeah yeah yeah g'bye so I know about Steve is that he had that other than if you considered the Les Paul a signature guitar even he has the most successful signature guitar model oh really yeah he has that you know the one with that on the guitar there's the cutout for you to carry it from the top mm-hmm so at least to my knowledge is the highest-selling signature guitar other than the Les Paul as far as not just Les Paul's but just kind of the major guitar brands out there right now do you often find yourself like you know in kind of the big box stores and music shops you know looking for new guitars and trying new guitars out or is is the is the pick of the the litter just not what it used to be unless you know you're shelling out thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars yeah I don't find myself in other than Chicago music exchanges for really really cool mm-hmm I mean a lot of their stuff is really really expensive but often go in there and just poke around and like buy smaller stuff like pedals but then still kind of gaze at the really expensive guitars but for me in an instrument I don't necessarily look at brand name too much mm-hmm and I have a lot of a lot of the guitar world too is strangely geared towards vintage stuff you know it's all about like this is exactly seems like that's that's that's a recently occurring thing I mean not only are a lot of those vintage instruments you know going for just top dollar right now but I believe it's fender has been recently coming out with these uh quote-unquote Road worn instruments yeah yeah yeah what are they were they out relict guitars yes yes yeah someone just like hit it with a hammer and then they sell it yeah then they fell to you and I don't know that that type of stuff or just this whole like vintage craze this this whole like I want a guitar that is exactly like if my grandfather went into the store and bought one like that doesn't appeal to me at all so I mean I to me I bet the whole mentality I don't really get like are there other industries that do that to this extent like like Ford keeps pumping out like the Model T every year like this is exactly like the first Model T and everyone's just driving you know Model T's around sure um I don't know it doesn't to me what when I look for an instrument it's mainly I look for something new about it that makes me play it a little bit differently like that's that's what I'm interested in like if I'm just looking around the room like I have my 9 string of course around here and having three extra strings like I got to learn how to play this a little bit differently or like I just I just got a Chapman guitar that has a tremolo on it Floyd Rose I've never used that before or just like 5 string bass just just something that's a little bit different about it that's gonna force me to play it differently that's more what I look for that's what interests me rather than like what brand it is even I guess if that makes sense you're so damn excessive Rob I mean so many strings more strings are you are you are you the guy who goes into the store like you know sees other people online with something like a 12 string bass or a 16 string bass and you're like my god yes yes this all day yeah yeah if it's like new and different and it's I give you I picked it up you have to play it differently that is what interests me so yeah I am and I am one of those people hmm sort of working you know the thing about modern music recording and and amplifiers and and pedals too is is that the technology while it has kept up with the times in a sense it's also progressed with sort of those more low scale string instruments in mind you know I I don't think a lot of bass amplifiers or cabinets are engineered with the the 12 string bass in mind you know do you think that that that's just kind of a weird niche thing and will continue to be so or do you think this string of excessiveness is going to continue and you know kind of change standards well I don't think it's going to continue in that pretty soon we're all going to be playing 13 strings yeah but I do think extended range isn't a gimmick and it's going to stick around I don't think it's going to be I don't think an eighth string guitar is ever going to be oh I don't know it's gonna be standard of genres but I think it's it's not a novelty and it's something that'll be around for a while yeah I don't know does that answer that question no I I think it does well I mean I think um I mean we'll see who knows maybe people won't even be playing guitars in five years now thank you well I mean that's that's that's a possibility too and that's that's a question that I that I actually not the specific question but just kind of the more of the future what you think the future of guitar music is but the thing is um you know for a while there was it's you know specifically in the 2000s it seemed like there was this budding market for this extended range and these other strings and but but the thing is in the music industry these guitars weren't really being given as much stage time as you would assume given that you see them in all the stores but it seems like Ghent is really the first genre where these kinds of guitars are seeing like incredible representation yeah like consistently from one band to the next yeah and I think that's cool mmm I think it's that's my opinion I think it's it's new and it's interesting and it's it's cool so you know I asked you more about you know just a more traditional metal and rock that people that you're into that people might not have assumed that you were that maybe you didn't mention or overtly like reference in a video are there any sort of gent groups that that you kind of see yourself consistently going back to their records again and again and again ah not really there honestly recently there's not many records in general that I keep going back to over and over again other than honestly other than Kendricks last album like the music I've been really getting into recently doesn't have guitars in it at all and I think I don't know I think that might just be because I spent so much time making guitar music hmm that yeah I don't know I'm at least currently in the last year I'm always moving around to what I'm listening to and there's not any particular there's not any particular bands right now that I listen to a lot if that makes sense no I mean it it most certainly does and then you're talking about I knew essentially play with your guitar all day I imagine that you're kind of relaxing that you're not just wanting to hear other people kind of play their guitars I imagine it kind of is is it hard for you sometimes to sit back and listen to guitar music and kind of turn off that critical year that I'm sure that you have because of how of a precise of a musician that you are no I I think it's I I would say that I can't listen to it without thinking about the technique that went into playing sure guitar so I do think that has something to do with it like like when I first started listening to say Primus or bucketed for example there was a big wow factor you know like I would watch when I went to that show for buck that I would watch him play or I would watch Primus and it was like I have no idea how they're doing that how is this sound made and there was a certain fascination and wandering it that now isn't there and I ruined it yeah not that I ruined it it's just i I've experienced it so much that if that initial wow factor maybe isn't there sure but I still do really really enjoy that music it's just not so you know some guitar players are especially even some metal fans it's like all metal all guitar all the time and that's not particularly my listening habits it's for me it's all over the place all the time but what I create is all the you know always guitar based well I mean while I love a lot of guitar music I feel like simply listening to guitar music can kind of be a little limiting especially if you're an artist who plays guitar because it kind of becomes like a bit of an echo chamber situation whereas yeah I mean you you know you've listened to stuff like that Kendrick record and you've taken it upon yourself to recreate that music on your guitar where I don't think that that would sort of dawn on a lot of guitarists sort of doing that sort of thing that was a really fun video by the way I really enjoyed trying to play genres on instruments that usually aren't made for that genre that's always like an interesting thing to do for me and that video in particular was a lot of fun because I am a big fan of Kendricks we're going into the future and and I've heard people kind of predict this before although I've never taken it very seriously because there continues to be guitars very prominently on numerous recordings throughout the year of obscure and mainstream but you know where do you sort of see guitar music going in in in in the future you know is is there always going to be a place for it I mean while I think the mainstream is a lot less rock driven than it used to be and it certainly seems like there's still room for guitars you know just not necessarily in a rock context it's the the guitar I mean people forget that the guitar predates rock music ya know and it's it's a very versatile instrument and that's all it really is at the end of the day it's an instrument it's not a symbol of any one particular genre and I think that if guitars are gonna continue to have a seat at the table musicians are gonna need to remind themselves as the other things that the guitar can do other than play rock and metal music yeah I mean I don't I don't see guitars going away in popular culture any time soon I guess if you look far enough into the future you know people aren't going to be around so I'm sure they're going to forget about guitars sure hum but I don't see that happening anytime soon and I see them to continue as you said they're so versatile I just I see what people see is guitar music evolving rather than people finding a different instrument to play it on or maybe the instruments change in a little way I mean I don't know I I don't I don't see certainly going away anytime soon and and right now from your perspective where do you kind of see that evolution going you know maybe you can't tell me where you know if you can't tell me where you think things are gonna be from five years from now for example you know is there anything going on right now in guitar music that you would have found to be completely surprising maybe several years ago yeah I don't know I don't know there's just so much going on and this is more on like music in general just with the internet there's so many different subgenres and so many different types of music that's kind of hard to pinpoint like what guitars are doing right now you know like um I don't know that I don't know how to answer that question well you're just kind of focus on your own thing yeah for me I'm just gonna continue doing what I find interesting and hopefully you know other people will continue to find it interesting too and that maybe you know me and my other YouTube guitarists will have a big part and how guitars are seen later and that that would be that would be cool or maybe we'll just have a big part in getting more people to pick up a guitar that would be something I can be really proud of I might see it seems like that's that's definitely the case of that's definitely the case for you right now I mean without some people receive your videos and see I have an oops oh because I think if what I'm working on is getting more people to play guitar or play any instrument really and and I put out a lot of tabs for my songs and I really encourage people to to learn them in like post cover videos and stuff and and if what I'm doing is getting more people to play music then that's that's something I can be really proud of though I don't think at this point I've had a very significant I don't think I've been super significant in that but if I do it at all that's great oh one more question before you know I just sort of um remind everybody of how great you are and what you do and then where they can find you well thanks I think I've been doing pretty bad on this podcast I feel like I don't know how to answer any of these questions I think I think you were doing good you know this podcast is more conversational than it is about yeah like oh did you give the great answer yeah it's uh but but I do I guess just on podcast real quick I do really I spend an enormous amount of time listening to podcasts like a huge part of my practice routine if I do have a practice routine it's just turning on a podcast of people talking and playing guitar for like two hours that's a bet like eh if you took a pie chart of my life that's a gigantic slice of my life is just playing and practicing or listening to podcasts I sometimes do that too and it's really weird but I don't know if that's like a good thing or a bad thing I mean obviously it's it's it's it obviously seems to not be a danger since you know you're you telling you that you're doing that and you're playing so well but simultaneously and maybe this isn't anything new I'm sure there are people who back in the day probably practice their guitar a while there's no yeah yeah listening the radio or watching TV or maybe at a family gathering or something but it seems like so reflective of the times that we always need to have something going on in the background boy has bite asking I can't just enjoy this one thing I need to be listening to a podcast well I don't know getting having a massage on my feet while doing this while playing a video game with my right hand you know so I I don't know I I guess years ago I probably wouldn't have done that I probably would well you know come to think of it way back I would watch TV a lot while playing hmm thanks oh I don't know I think maybe it's something that's always been around I'm not sure but it helps me a lot like it helps me just not be distracted just enough to where I am just playing for fun and I find I stumble across things more often that then turn into songs it I'm also listening to podcasts at the same time and focusing on what people are talking about well you know part of the creative process I think part of the key to the creative process is being able to kind of clear your mind and relax a little bit yeah and that's that's something I find probably is the most challenging thing to do about it and when you're kind of stressing yourself out over the fact that you're not coming up with the amazing idea that you're trying to come up with right then and there with the guitar with whatever in your hand sometimes you know that that inspiration strikes when you're able to clear your head or just have things a a little calmer and with that distraction in the background sometimes calm this is a little easier to to attain I could not have said it better I completely agree I I have I struggle with that where and I always have to where I start playing and then I stumble upon something small and if I'm so focused on I'm like maybe this is it maybe this is this song maybe this isn't the most popular song I'm ever gonna have I'd better not mess this up and then I messed it up you know there's these that I find with being a full time creative person there's two modes you need to be able to switch in and out of one's the creative mode where you need to not be worried about business or or success or making things at all sure and you need to just be doing it for fun to write things that you're gonna like on the other side of it you also need to have the business side and being in one mindset and doing the other never works you need to be one or the other and no one when those are going on if that makes sense I find it's really really easy to when I get in a creative mode to snap into business mode and then creative modes gone and I can't write songs anymore and it's really really hard if I'm in a business mode like I get on the computer I'm replying to emails or I'm editing or something to go once I'm in that mode I can't create anything for the rest of the day at least anything that I'm gonna like I can phone it in but to really write a song that I'm going to enjoy a lot I need to not be worrying about writing songs which is a weird dynamic to try to be productive while simultaneously to be productive you need to not worry about being productive as far as you know original work goes and and I know that you know obviously this is still a focus for you and this is a really important thing to you obviously you know given with how easy it is to sort of put this unwanted pressure onto yourself to be like oh I got to write this really amazing thing or this this is the one do you know is it ever in the back of your head even though you know in a way you're kind of rejecting the idea of this traditional music industry thing because you know it can be harmful and you know that it's it's it's not necessarily going to work in your favor or kind of be conducive to all the things that you would like to be doing these comedy videos these original songs and and whatever else you've got to kind of you know have in the fire right now but is it ever in the back of your head to kind of a like man I really want to have like that that classic album everyone remembers or everybody refers back to you know is that something that's that's tempting to you or is is the cake like a lie I think the cake is it I mean maybe I'm being pessimistic but I think that traditional success in the music industry the cake is kind of a lie for most people learn for well the overwhelmingly musicians it doesn't work out that way but I yeah I don't I I don't look for traditional music success at all if it happens to know that there's some ways where I have kind of stumbled on it like I've like I've had songs and commercials but things like that and that's really cool when it happens and you know I've been able to tour thankfully with my friends and those have been you know way more than I could ever ask for in a tour and a ton of fun so when I stumble upon it I'm happy when it does but I'm not seeking any type of traditional music success because I find it just it it's just a waste of effort into something that isn't gonna give you any returns I I'm way more interested in doing things on the internet because it's it seems like and this is just my perspective as a music fan yeah you know and and now kind of stumbling into the music industry just off of kind of just just by virtue of doing what I do not because anybody was like hey come on in but you know kind of growing up and and listening to music very seriously and taking music very seriously even as I was listening to artists you know who had a strong comedic point to their music and and now and now that I'm kind of here the more that I'm able to kind of you know learn and and see how things really work those really classic albums that I thought were so great and they are definitely great I mean I don't think there's any reason that you shouldn't pick up a copy of what Pet Sounds and realize how great and catchy and fun and enjoyable of a record that is but I think now that I'm here you just kind of slowly realize just how manufactured it all is like even the really great parts and and how much and and sort of how little of a role great music ends up playing in in a classic record like the great music is obviously there but a big chunk of it was also like the marketing end of things yeah and and and the thing is like if you go on to a website like rate your music for example where just like all the reviews all the opinions are completely user-generated like if you look at albums from just the 50s or the 60s or the 70s on that website pretty much every album on that site that they say is great like is is just like in lockstep with pretty much everything that Rolling Stone said was great back in the day you know but once you store it but once you start to like you know move forward a little bit and and now that we're in the internet age often you'll find that what the public says you know in this democratized kind of way this is amazing will will vary pretty strongly from what the critics say sometimes yeah people have a stronger say now oh yeah absolutely and and I think um I mean I think in in this age I mean do you think there's even such a thing as a classic record can we have a classic record is is anybody gonna remember any of this shit 15 years from now you know and not to say that there isn't good music coming out right now I think there is but there's there's just so much of it and it all just seems so fractured to the point where like is anybody gonna remember anything you know because it just seems like we're so onto the next thing all the time I mean there are only a few records over the past five years that I can recall as being something where I actually feel like the greater world of music actually like paused for a second to be like wow wow you know and then was on to the next thing but at least there was that you know initial pause for a little bit you know we're not getting these really lengthy successful promotional campaigns after the release of a record more often than not as soon as an album is released that's like its lowest relevance point like they kind of just build up the hype for months and months and months and months and months up to the point of the release of the album and then once the album is out like all discussion just goes away like some reviews pop out but then we're talking about whatever album is being hyped the next week which is something that more artists today are kind of opting out of by just releasing albums out of the blue yeah but um I think there will be classic albums and I think we're gonna look back and there's gonna be a handful of them that really represent out of the 2015 but it it's just hard to say now we think we think in the 2020 is we're gonna look back at this Kendrick record I think so yeah I do yeah I think so as well but it'll be interesting to sort of see how the the the generation that hardly focused on anything for more than a few minutes will remember its own history you know will they remember it with with the same kind of accuracy or sometimes in accuracy as the people who lived through it I mean because certainly you know there's I haven't seen as many people kind of calling foul on the whole NWA movie that just dropped which you know glossed over a ton of NWA history yeah I haven't seen it but I've heard that some of it is pretty dishonest so where it's like the them being misogynistic is completely taken out of the movie apparently that's pretty much taken out of the movie and and the very loud and obvious beef that was going on between dr. Dre and eazy-e is like completely erased out of the movie because it's not like people don't know about that yeah of likes the song the songs are all over the chronic yeah you know there's actually even a part in the movie where ez is like driving and he sees a billboard for the chronic and he like smiles at it like yeah that's my that's my man Dre right there yeah and meanwhile there's songs on that record that blatantly make fun of him yeah like the first the first song is just all about this is just all criticizing eazy-e it's entirely just talking about how much he sucks to know which one so yeah you know that's my friend stuff like that is completely you know like glossed over and it's something that you know when I was listening to dr. Dre's new record I kind of I gave him the benefit of the doubt because there were so many tracks on there he's like yo my dude easy looking at me from four beyond the grave he thinks I'm that good you know and and maybe after all those years you know nobody nobody could stay mad for that long especially at somebody who you know was so key to your success and and also like so also uh I want to say key to your success and also died so abruptly you know and so unnecessarily but then you know you certainly get a bit strange if he continued to beef going after his untimely pass yeah absolutely absolutely it just stays oh but but then simultaneously to like you know just blatantly omit that whole thing from the movie that you were directly involved in yeah and instead play it like things are all hunky-dory not only that but you know dr. Dre's character in that movie super nice guy wouldn't yet hurt a fly totally a nice dude who was just surrounded by all these bad behaving people yeah like come on like you can still be you can still be a legend but it's it's you can be honest like I don't know he's allegedly is in his business he's it's I don't know that's another kind of instance of you know like a vision in stage 3 maybe not just a revisionist history but the cake being a y-you know but like we were talking about earlier because you know there's so much image building in the music industry that goes along with not only the marketing of your record and your music you know I I caught a talk not too long ago about it was it was at a music festival Primavera Sound recently where I was literally watching a panel of all these music writers talk about why they write about bands or why they write about certain bands or how bands break into the music industry and it all starts with like you know one of the dudes and we were talking about people from pitchfork LA Times you know freelancers for a lot of different venues you know these people are in the industry they write from you they write about music professionally or they're writing professionally and they're talking about well the first thing that comes into my head is what what is the narrative of this band you know and that's like the last thing on fucking my like you know honestly like I don't I don't care if you're in and and and I feel for people who are in the situation but like it's it's not relevant to me that your mom and your dad came from like a war-torn country or that like you know you have you're of a certain spiritual denomination or that I don't know you wear clothes a certain way or that I don't know you just like had a really hard come up or something or a really easy one I don't really care you know I just want to know if I enjoy your music ultimately yeah though that's I think it's harder to write about just the type of music that they're making rather than it's it's a it's an easier it's it's a quicker grab of attention to say I don't know this person came from this background and here are the songs rather than hear the songs ya know it's it's it's true this guy came from a cult yeah I was in a cult and he broke out of the cult and then he came out with an amazing album you know it's that that stuff can be you know a little crazy and in the fact that you know people gravitate toward that stuff it's not just the marketing but also the music fans you know who gravitate yeah that's not it's not like the the industry is creating this system it's they're playing in to whatever is going to get in this place nowadays the cliques absolutely it's white going and that's what's going to get the cliques which leads to you know a lot of fabrication you know not just by and not just by the industry people too but by the musicians themselves because they're actively realizing this and they're manipulating this as well I mean we were always going on in the Straight Outta Compton movie yeah that's what's going on the Straight Outta Compton movie and that's what you could you know maybe it wouldn't be quite as popular and as in demand if the D Farnes part of that story was in it you know well yeah absolutely and I mean also if the fact that you know and and not even just in the movie but like if if you know everybody in it like if they had if they had told if they were telling the truth on that album right from the start the the title of the album would be Straight Outta Compton except for Ice Cube because I he wasn't Straight Outta Compton at the he actually went to you know a much nicer school than the other dudes in in the group yeah I didn't know that yeah which they actually reference in the movie for a split second but they don't actually tell you you know he's he sort of at you know his more affluent high school at the very start of the film but then he takes the bus you know to where he lives after school and you know Ice Cube was actually very very well educated in comparison with everybody else in the group but the thing is that's not something that they really talked about that that well in NWA and not that I think that that's a mark against him or anything like that and I would say it's a mark against him at all no but the thing is like you know but for people who are like sort of hardcore into the idea of hip-hop authenticity you know to some of these like purists like it could definitely be you know especially since like you know Ice Cube wasn't necessarily leading the kind of lifestyle that that he was rapping about all the time um you know there's a part in the film where he actually says you know uh one of the first singles or first tracks that ended up on NWA his debut record that eazy-e recorded you know he's like I wrote this song about you dude you know he uh because he was you know sort of telling a story from the perspective of eazy-e and not that they weren't saying real things in their music but but still you know the idea of you know a group of people coming together in this one place that nobody knows about and all experiencing these same things that's way more marketable than like you know oh the student was actually from this other town or you know that these guys all didn't have the same kind of life experience or whatever yeah the idea of like one group coming together and like forming like the fuckin Power Rangers and and then coming in and they're coming out with this amazing album is just like so much all having like all forming into like Megatron or why don't what is the Power Rangers version of that I guess you know Voltron or whatever swords the Power Rangers they had Zords yeah yeah I'll get in there like cars that moved together and then that this big NWA absolutely and the idea of doing that the idea of that is just so much more sellable yeah I still want to see the movie but did you like it even if it is like even if there are some parts that are like glaringly dishonest like it still seems like a like it would be a really interesting watch as a film I thought the first half was like really well put together in the second half I think the dialogue and and and and the characters aren't quite as strong as they were in the first half like I actually wish they stuck around sort of in that time period of the first half a little bit where you know NWA was you know in in the late 80s and kind of creating their music and living these certain experiences and and I wish they sort of delved into their personal lives during that point in certain short of did a better job of kind of showing their camaraderie a little bit more during that era of their career but it kind of seems like they rushed through all of that a little bit so they could get to their eventual breakup yeah there could be like a bit of a climax and some drama to the film you know and it's a little disappointing because I guess I wouldn't say even though some things were left out that they were you know really trying to tell a big fat lie but it was more like they were trying to rush through everything and they had no choice but to leave all this stuff yeah a lot of stuff the cutting room floor like if you're gonna tell the story from NWA's inception to the point where dr dre is going solo that's a lot to pack in yeah and you're not gonna tell it all with any sort of detail in 90 minutes you know all of a sudden we're skipping from one event to another all of which happened and are portrayed in a relatively accurate degree on the screen but there's so much more context that was just kind of left out so I know it's a successful movie yeah yeah so I mean I kind of get the limitations but I thought it would have been fantastic and also interesting if you know it had been told to the point where maybe Ice Cube broke off from the group and then we kind of got that has one movie and then they did a sequel because the movie even so far has been incredibly successful yeah and they had that fantastic marketing campaign sure absolutely yeah where you could do straight out of whatever and then a lot of people were making jokes out of it and then those would you know go semi viral and the memes man let me make some memes means people make some memes make some memes I'm not a good good meme marketing man yeah that was good meme marketing was very good marketing on their point and did you hear that they're making a sequel or is that just some stuff I saw on Facebook I heard they were making a sequel but the thing is and and and I heard them talking about that sort of like you know on a panel but the thing is how it just doesn't seem like they they told I guess the whole story you know like I mean I could see a sequel if they stopped off when Ice Cube left the group because he realized that he was getting the short end of the stick yeah you know well maybe they'll just continue to make sequels until the movie is about them making the first movie maybe like they get two sequel four and now it's all about casting for the first movie maybe and then asking them to for them to be casting I don't know he kind of kind of funny and it was it was a pretty cool film and sort of seeing Ice Cube son play Ice Cube was kind of a head trip yeah and and just that this story is being told at this level yeah and knowing when I mean when this was made I think Straight Outta Compton was made in what six weeks and I mean no one could have forced foreseen 25 years later that is gonna be an entire movie I mean that's there's something really cool in that oh yeah absolutely like rags to riches story you would say yeah and uh yeah I want to see it I I I'm surprised I haven't seen it yet but it seems like a really interesting movie all right well I think we're just gonna leave it off here since we're just shooting the shit over movies at this point even talking about you anymore oh yeah he talked a lot about easy you're just an hour worth of material and then we just branched off into nwf that's where all the conversations lead with me is just an hour into it we just start talking about NWA that's not true that but that would be a funny scenario that was the case all right I want to thank Rob Scallon for coming on to my podcast and talking about his YouTube channel being a musician in the modern age and just doing all the fantastic stuff that he does on a regular basis right back at you Anthony best keep in the game best fucking teeth in the game thank you finally some recognition I'm going to link to Rob's YouTube channel his Twitter also his patreon where you can do what he said do what he calls a super subscribe yeah the patreon I guess back on that being a musician in the modern age patreon is a huge game-changer I've actually been to the viewers I've been kind of hounding Anthony to get on patreon and they keep recommending it to him I'm so bad at it though you know I think about it I really think you should have like for me it's it's it's just such a it's just such a huge game changer and it it's so fantastic to have that steady patreon funding from from support directly from the people that are actually watching you rather than having to do sponsors or do viral videos all the time it's it's just I can't say enough good things about patreon a huge reason why I was able to go full-time was that I went full-time at the same time patreon started so I had that extra support and yeah it's fantastic I think you should get on it and you should not worry about the people that are gonna fall you're still uh you're making money doing things okay if you get if you guys see me jumping back onto patreon or jumping on the patreon I'm doing that full force on it's Rob's fault so yeah you take it up with Rob yeah you can go ahead and tweeted me that I'm making Anthony a sellout or something all right dude thanks for coming on again and I'm looking forward all the new videos thanks so much dude thanks all right "
dZNbP2WerLA,kill the stab tail here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new fiddler record - it dawg life's a risk is a California rock band this is their sophomore full-length record and they broke with a pretty dirty grimy whiskey-soaked stubble faced garage punk sound just a few years ago with their full-length self-titled debut a record that had a few standout tracks on it but ultimately it didn't really stick with me because the black lips influence on this thing was just so painfully obvious but now that the the Georgia band's latest full-length record was really one of the lowest points and their entire discography maybe fiddler will actually kind of come through and sort of grab that garage Punk throne and put together a great memorable good record good and just on the surface level of things production wise and musically fiddler shows quite a bit of improvement here even on the first track their sound their overall sound is still kind of gruff but it's definitely poppier a little bit more groomed and cleanly put together and assembled the very snotty vocal delivery on these tracks really pops in the mix - and even with some of the drums and then the guitars are sounding a little too clean those vocals come in to kind of balance it out and make things sound a little you know mean and nasty and sometimes the band kind of samples themselves in their own music to kind of create these repetitive cycles of beats or like you know little little musical hits to just I guess pepper a little bit more character personality into these instrumentals I guess this is just kind of the modern age of rock music you can't really ignore the world of hip-hop in the world of electronic music I mean you've got to kind of embrace those aesthetics at least a little bit if you're making a rock record these days that's going to appeal widely and there's actually quite a bit of versatility on this record of ffff some tracks on here like punk feel really noisy race a very psychedelic ish and in the moment meanwhile the cut leave me alone has these kind of gated drums on it that sound like they could have landed on some sort of 80s new wave song so just sound wise so far Fiddler's I think has surpassed their debut record and I think some of their best songs land on this record too like the track West Coast which has this really sweet sunny sort of citrus flavored melody to it sounds like something that could land even on a Best Coast record but as I mentioned before those vocals pop in sound just really well yeah very bratty very nasty and they kind of balance that sweetness out and it's just a well-crafted catchy song I'm really loving the hook on the song why generation where there's some really tight vocal harmonies on the chorus here and the song drone this is a very grimy piece of pop punk here here here and there are a few interesting stylistic changes of pace on this LP Fiddler's is certainly more versatile on this album they were on their last LP I think from the kind of downtrodden and very low-key cut on the song overdose to the song stupid decisions which kind of feels like a bit of 90s alt rock with a splash of country music leaked into there and the opening track on here has some really interesting musical bits where all of a sudden they're just shifting right into this little passage with some toy piano or some acoustic guitar just kind of editing in this surprise instrumentation to give things more color more personality a little ideality the instrumentation most of the time on this record is a fun lesson which is why it's so disappointing for me to be just not enjoy this album mostly because of the lyrics and the vocals and the personality that comes through on a lot of these songs there are moments when I'm listening to this record and I just cringe at how bratty and annoying and aimless so many of these songs are the album generally puts forward this message that hey we would rather instead of contributing something or fixing anything or really saying anything about anything we would rather just kind of be self-destructive and whine about it the whole time this whole record is essentially a temper tantrum that the band is throwing they're just kicking and thrashing and screaming as life inevitably drags them toward adulthood and eventually old age I do drugs I don't want to go to college mom I don't want a job the thing is all of this stuff is optional but the band is rebelling against it like it's some kind of I don't know pressive put on and they're just battling against it which I don't know is is like an easy belief system to hold for a generation of people whose parents are just doting over them and handing the money whenever they need more money and I think the results of that are kind of shown in song like sober which is an excruciating song to listen to certainly to an extent I think was intentional for the song to be this annoying it just kind of sounds like listening to I don't know a really indignant teenage girl from California get angry with her parents after they call her on I don't know probably like a pill-popping issue and just saying that she's you know engaging in some really crappy behavior and she's just like it's mind-boggling that the band would do songs like this and then simultaneously work in tracks on this record like overdose which is not just the quietest track on the record to a point but it's also the darkest song on the record literally about in overdose what would probably be for a lot of people a bit of a wake-up call I mean the lyrics on this thing are really intense the story is kind of sad and the explosion of guitars and drums at the very end of the song is disturbing and noisy and grim maybe they're trying to make a statement here on addiction and drug abuse maybe not but the band relapse is really quickly into songs like stupid decisions as well as on the song bad habits I'm flabbergasted as to how many times this can sing about the same exact thing and cry about it and complain about it their last full-length record while it wasn't deep and it was an original at least it sounded like a completely shameless non-stop party fiddler puts the message out there that we had bad habits we don't give a and we don't care but yet it constantly comes off like especially the moment at the very end where where we get the vocal line I'm becoming my dad which is the biggest crisis in the world for somebody who doesn't want to be a drone but simultaneously doesn't see how unoriginal their alternative lifestyle decisions are as they fall into the ranks of just another easily categorized group of people at least I can compliment this record on doing a great job of embodying a person who is completely insufferable and and totally lacking in any sort of self-control or discipline the ugly annoying narcissistic and just garbage person tendencies on this album are so exaggerated I don't even believe that anybody in the band acts like this but yet it doesn't really feel like satire that anything here is really illustrated to to make a point even if things are exaggerated on this album it does feel like the band wholeheartedly believes in this whole live fast die young ethos which I mean that's cool that's your option but simultaneously they sound super upset that their mommies and daddies aren't footing the bill for it I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing transition have you given this wrecker to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Fiddler's forever hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here you know it is just wanted to tell you

75rHMYjYs-c,hi everyone no no theny cried tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Wonder Years record no closer to heaven these guys are a Philly rock band combining elements of pop punk alternative rock and emo also known as the suburban blues and for years now this band has been dropping albums loaded with anthemic melodies and just shouted passionate vocals the band's music has a Punk edge to it but simultaneously it is triumphant and life-affirming I used to have a lot more interest in this style of music back in college and and not that I don't enjoy a lot of those old records I still do it's just that a lot of these newer groups have have really failed to kind of keep my interest in emo and pop punk up although the Wonder Years aren't exactly a newer group they've been doing it for quite a while now about 10 years at this point and with their latest records they're definitely evolved beyond the somewhat melodic hardcore influenced sound that you'll find on their earlier stuff they have had many records and many years to sort of refine and groom what it is exactly that they're doing and it definitely shows on this new album I don't exactly care for the intro track on this on this record but it does show some really refined execution with a lot of guitar layers and big group vocals and just a huge drum build it's like a post-rock ish crescendo kind of cliche but the song still transitions into an incredibly explosive and passionate opening track that really piqued my interest right at the start of the record this track featured a really tight performance and vocals that were really loud really in your face but not why need to the point where they're sort of excruciating the melodic guitar lines on this track were good the tight vocal harmonies in the background underneath the lead vocals were good I thought this track had a lot of good things going on for it and then as we move on to the song a song for Patsy Cline I'm not exactly sure why this song is for Patsy Cline I think the reasoning behind the title might be a little esoteric because after numerous listens to this song into the weird I'm not exactly getting why this song is titled the way that it's titled and and I am kind of a Patsy Cline fan so I I was intrigued by the title but then the song itself was just because when I do read into the lyrics on this track I just kind of get the usual emotional rhetoric that you would get in an emo or a pop punk tune of this flavor same sort of goes for the song for Ernest Hemingway as well on the starter though at least he's mentioned very boldly on that track there are many mentions on this album of crooked teeth and stinging lungs and heart beats and weeks passing by and all this time just slipping through our fingers and letting go it's about you buck away just like a lot of big emotional choruses on this record some of the choruses on this thing are actually kind of self-deprecating like on the track I don't like who I was back then where it is sung in fact I've managed not to this up and if there is one more hook or sort of play on words that sticks out to me on this record it's definitely the dead bird bloodhound metaphor that I thought was pretty cutting but aside from that at this point on the album as I'm listening I'm just realizing that this album really isn't gonna bring anything new or refreshing to the table is it and that is exactly the case I mean the wonder years I for putting together as coherent and as slick a record as they have here and the performances are good all around as well but I feel like they fall into the stereotype and the cliche of many bands in this style these days where they're not so much advancing the sound advancing the style or trying to come up with their own distinct niche or direction within it they're merely just keeping the torch burning just because I think technically this record is is definitely there I mean the vocals carry a tune pretty well the guitars carry quite a bit of influence from like either and blink-182 sometimes in the vocals are a little subdued and that not shouting they feel a little bare naked ladies ish in a good way but despite all their efforts all the wonder years end up doing on this album is just merely working up to an emo and pop punk standard not really doing anything beyond that they're just kind of satisfying a blueprint I don't even think this record does anything to bring a refreshing perspective on the real everyday struggles in life that these songs sort of seem to be centered around whether it comes to relationships both romantic and platonic or existence and death the Wonder Years just kind of handed in a really average take on these issues as far as emo standards go anyway which I guess in and of itself isn't really a hard pill to swallow but it becomes one once I'm trying to listen through this entire record and every single song is trying to sound as emotional and dramatic as possible but not even really giving me a reason to be emotional with the music I guess maybe my issue is that I didn't go into this album upset or looking for something to be upset about or looking for I don't know some kind of justification of my feelings I mean I was just you know looking to be kind of entertained I guess and unfortunately this is really the only angle the wonder years seem to know how to work on this record maybe with the exception of the predictably acoustic closer I'm just pretty indifferent to this record I mean I think it's well crafted I think it's well put together but again I think all of it added up into just a really average record in this style of music I'm feeling a light a decent 5 on this thing transition have you given this record to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh the Wonder Years forever 
bS3S9siJqdc,hi everyone Headly say medal here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review the new Iron Maiden record book of souls infamous heavy metal band Iron Maiden and one of the bands that I go to first to recommend whenever anybody comes up to me the hey how did it end mell Maiden drop so many stellar records in the 80s you just really cannot go wrong with the early output but as the band continued into the nineties and into the aughts they delivered their trademark sound with varying degrees of success and it was in 2010 the last time that we heard from Maiden in a studio album capacity with the record final frontier and there were some decent Tunes on this record the title track was certainly great but vocally I think Bruce definitely left a lot to be desired plus the production on this record was pretty weak overall as well with the drums and the guitars coming together in just a really flat lifeless one-dimensional way not really the throttling and very thrilling ride that you sort of expect from an Iron Maiden record I mean it wasn't the worst record since their heyday but certainly not the way that you want to step into the new decade which Iron Maiden has been silent for the bulk of so far I mean we're halfway through the decade and it's only now that we're getting a new full-length album in this new record over here book of souls is billed to be a doozy the band's longest studio album to date standing at 90 minutes another 90-minute album there have been many minute records coming out this year but you know Iron Maiden you got you got to listen to it and it's not like the the tracks on this record add up to 90 minutes because they're being spread out amongst 15 or 20 or so tracks or something like that no we are getting 11 tracks on this album some mid-sized tracks for the bulk of this album but it's kind of peppered here and there with 10 13 and 18 minutes song closing this entire record out as well on a majority of these tracks we are hearing maidens usual suspects turning up in these songs the very bright burning guitar leads sometimes that dual guitar action driving bass lines just synched up very neatly and very precisely with some fantastic drumming Bruce Dickinson's soaring epic passionate and dramatic vocals which usually deliver a great deal of poetry as well many of the tracks on this record don't really feature Iron Maiden doing anything too new or revolutionary but they are at least doing what they are known for very well at least a you know about as well as they're known for doing it which kind of reminds me of the new motor had record in a sense I mean you know Motorhead is is so old at this point and their new record I mean they just sound like they're they're still in their their 20s or the 30s they're just like ripping ass all over the place but as far as this made in record the track speed of light one of the most hard-hitting tracks in the track listing here you can essentially rack up another good heavy metal song in the maiden catalog for the band on this one driving bass lines burning guitar leads like I said earlier really engaging and exciting versus explosive choruses on this track and kind of a swagger filled intro with some syncopated drums and guitars like a lot of very funky fills going into the beginning of this track and some strong cowbell I mean this song rocks with a W right in there rocks and Bruce Dickinson's performance on this track is really great too I mean I loved his a really almost evil cause of you met - you won't save us and another thing I'm noticing on this track and many other tracks on here too is that the production is better than it was on final frontier the guitars actually have punch and body they sound like guitars the bass is very clear and very discernible in the mix the drums are crystal clear as well and there's a nice balance a nice sense of placement between all the instruments - I actually feel like I'm listening to a performance not just some kind of like mockery of the sort of instrumentation that you would get out of an Iron Maiden record so given that the production is good I guess I don't really mind that a lot of songs here just kind of sound like Maidan as usual the great unknown when the river runs deep the song death or glory which has some pretty epic war imagery going into the lyrics on this track war very much a recurring theme in the Iron Maiden song catalog I like the lyrics on the song tears of a clown too a lot of very epic and grim and very sinister poetry throughout this Iron Maiden record however on some of these more mid-sized tracks there are a few lows on the song tears of a clown as well as on the song the man of sorrows bruce Dickinson's vocals kind of try to go into this more I guess dramatic ballad like gear rather than kind of the very aggressive very theatrical delivery he's known for giving very campy deliver he's known for giving a lot of Records which is again entertaining but here is his vocals kind of have this really weird moaning quality to them where he sounds like he's more in pain than he is like singing he really falls short of the commanding delivery that that he's become known for however going into this record I wasn't really all that interested in these more mid-sized tracks as I was the longer songs because they were essentially making this album the big deal that it is the 90-minute deal that it is how are these 8 10 13 18 minute tracks and personally I actually think on these longer songs is where this album gets the dice East one of the many issues I have of some of these longer Trax's some of them are overwrought with extra instrumentation which is nowhere near as vibrant or as amazing to the ears as the bass instrumentation yeah the production on on Iron Man's usual guitars and drums and vocals is really nice but stuff like the very thin and cheesy synth horns that kick the entire record off don't really set the epic tone that the band is obviously going for or even the closing track here we get a lot of like pianos and strings turning up on the track which sounds super synthetic or at least mixed in such a way where they just have no real presence in in the music and the mix and it just kind of sounds like a little Disney ish how the you know the instrumentation sounds definitely does not sound like I'm listening to a metal record the strings often add this glossiness to the mix that kind of takes off the edge on these songs which I think at this point Iron Maiden's career the edge definitely needs to be there these songs don't have as much bite as the band used to have back in the day what little bite we're getting here we need that we need that bite and believe me there are elements of these songs that I like I mean Empire in the clouds I think there are a lot of great moments on this incredibly lengthy track and I love a lot of the funky medieval melodies that are worked into this track too but on the song the red and black for me there's just like nothing salvageable on this track the very muddy guitar right at the beginning of the song which sounds like it might be a baritone guitar something sounds really just farty and just again muddy and then as we go into the song itself we're getting Bruce Dickinson just like in lockstep with the lead melody the guitars playing throughout the track which is a little speedy it's kind of a complicated lead melody and Bruce kind of loses control of his breath control and he just kind of sounds ridiculous trying to ride this guitar melody rather than just singing his own I guess specific vocal line he sounds like he's trying to run a marathon and sing the song on on but to go back to this extra instrumentation that's layered on some of these big tracks clearly made in wanted to write longer songs but they thought that merely just writing them off of guitar and then leaving it simply as that wouldn't necessarily do these epic songs total justice because they wanted some kind of extra sound to be in there to elevate the track to make it sound special and make it sound different from every other song here but the thing is that arrange that extra instrumentation sounds so fake and the the textures the aesthetic that it brings doesn't really again carry that sense of grandness that I think the band wanted especially on the closing track where I think they needed the most and if you were going to come out with a 90 minute record if you were going to come out with a big record I just don't understand why Iron Maiden wouldn't have spared the expense to just get some better sounding a range instrumentation in here I mean you're one of the greatest metal bands of all time I mean I'm sure there are people pit orchestras of people who would be dying to work with you but it seems that instead of kind of taking that plunge in to really kind of filling these songs out and making them sound huge and making them sound panoramic and really giving us a change of pace here instead they've just kind of strung a bunch of songs out with just these various Maiden isms which is okay because the band is definitely sounded pretty tight on this record and and again the more vital more alive than they were sounding odd final frontier but with those okay results we are getting an okay record I'm feeling a decent six on this record transition have you given this record a listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Iron Maiden forever 
CTgwX9ZbsCs,hey everyone it's your buddy Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and you caught us at a really great time because we were about to crack the code answer the question that has plagued mankind for millennia we're gonna figure this out we're so close to the answer I can taste it it's it's time for a review of the new Dame funk record invite the Lite Dame funk is a songwriter a multi-instrumentalist a singer and a producer known for his love and his revivalism of Golden Age 80s synth funk and he embodies this style this genre this era in his music through and through from the big names like Prince and Rick James to the obscure dusty 12-inch extended dance mixes and singles that you could probably find in the doll urban milk crates at your local record shops across the country if you want to get a clearer ideas who our Dame funk is coming from musically and stylistically boiler-room recently put out a video where he is like doing a little DJ set of tons of records from his personal collection and watching that DJ set not only will you be taken back to a time in music which rarely gets its due as far as modern conversations about music but you'll also be just again getting this clear idea as to what inspires dame to do what he does however he can be a little tough to engage with sometimes with the various obscurities that sit throughout his discography the archival releases his big breakout project on Stones Throw Records is like this five album project that's a lot of scent funk deme he's not really a single driven type guy he's kind of been lost I think in in in the haze of new artists out there that are bringing sent funk back a little bit like chromeo and tuxedo and Mark Ronson with that uptown funk single as well as blood orange even Snoop Dogg's new album with Pharrell has a synth funk vibe on it and and dame has taken part in some of these more concise synth funk releases as well we have the collaborative release he did with Arrington we also have that seven days of funk collaborative record that Dame funk did with Snoop Dogg which actually liked more than that Pharrell Snoop Dogg album but now that Damon is again in that solo capacity we are getting a 90-minute album it's sprawling but it also covers all of the synth funk bases with this album Dame isn't so much coming through with just a sharp record but it's almost as if he's like creating this obscure little synth funk party for all the cool kids who are in the know and are maybe a little purist and a little into the idea of experimenting with synth funk a bit because there's nothing to clean glitzy and and modern about what Dame does on this record there's something kind of weird about it and it's something that I really couldn't put my finger on or sort of put a characteristic to until I saw in the track listing here Arial pink is actually a featured guest and then I thought oh well I mean that now makes total sense Dame funk is kind of like that strange oddball but very talented revivalist within a certain genre of music however I did come out of this track kind of disappointed because there didn't really seem to be a that much chemistry between what Dame and Ariel were doing on this track didn't really have a strong song a strong direction that memorable of melody it seemed pretty devoid of any kind of bold musical decisions of any sort I mean it's a lot of atmosphere and a lot of strange vocalizations on the part of Dame and Ariel still though this track did have a message to it I guess a bit of a silver lining to the cloud which is about acting faking the funk as they say and I guess lying either about oneself or maybe this is some kind of acknowledgement of Dame talking about his musical shtick his slightly campy vocals all over this record and this track is one of many examples where Dame is trying to put meaning into a lot of these songs and and give these tracks and maybe give this album a little bit of a story and a little bit of a progression sort of like with the weird radio transmissions that book and this album delivered by Junie Morrison of Funkadelic and Ohio Players Fame where he's talking about the funk or even the track surveillance escape where it feels like Dame funk is portraying himself as this funk renegade that is being surveilled by I don't know anti funke's the the anti funk CIA the anti funk lobby the people who don't want his music getting on the radio or getting popular seems a little annoyed if you ask me there are actually some tracks in the track listening here that take on a bit of a mini progression within the album itself like the very Spacey and psychedelic and beautiful floating on air great track beautiful song just wonderful textures throughout this track and then as we leave this song with the next track we get this voice popping and saying meanwhile back on earth and we get this gravelly deep low just very nocturnal Club where the funk music playing on the song how you gonna around and choose a Busta which has this awesome kick clap drum pattern an awesome bass line as well very groovy and this squealing screaming little sentimentality that colors the the space left by all the other instrumentation perfectly and we move from this track to a song and instrumental kind of about hunting Lucifer then the song it didn't have to be this way then the song miss you right there we get this progression from jealousy to violence to regret and is damn merely singing about some kind of altercation between him and some guy who stole a girl away from him in the club and he's angry or are we talking about some kind of battle between good and evil here and there does seem to be like some Christian themes on this record - when Dame does make mention of good and evil he uses terminology that you would typically pick up in some Christian philosophy and there are actually quite a few tracks in the track listing here that take a really heavenly tone to them I feel like I'm listening to funk from the afterlife funk from beyond the grave funk heaven yo funk heaven so there is definitely a logical flow to a lot of the tracks on this record and the album overall though I will say that sometimes some of these tracks can come off a little under produced almost as if they were just thrown together really haphazardly in a digital audio workstation and they're not mixed so that their feels like there's any space between any of the instruments on the record rather instead they feel very claustrophobic and one-dimensional however this isn't really the case on the more ethereal and more heavenly tracks which is nice but another critique I have of some of the music on this record is that the percussion can be kind of overly simple and a little stiff maybe if there were more bits of drums added into the mix or maybe if the drums were less rigid and less quantized or maybe even if there was some live percussion being laid into this record the grooves would be so much more captivating and fun I do see the second half of this record all of the tracks before the last radio transmission the handful of songs after the final radio transmission on this record feel like I don't know a handful loose ends sort of like they didn't really totally need to be there just adding to this albums overstayed welcome a little bit but still I think the second half of this record is a little bit more solid than the first and actually features the bulk of this album's vocal features we have Snoop Dogg on here who delivers a great verse and totally takes me back to like that G Funk era Snoop Dogg we have Indy elites like kids sister and Knight and jewel among others popping up on a track which sounds very gorgeous very heavenly one of the catchiest tracks in the track listing here we have Leon Silver's the third and the fourth you know Leon Silver's the third and son here on the song glide tonight which is one of the moments here where Dame isn't really showing his eccentric side we're not getting that weird nasally vocal we're not getting some of the weird synth layers this is actually quite an accessible and and very catchy song that sounds like it could have been really radio ready if it had come out back in the day but a whatever it doesn't really matter because we have it now and and it's good I mean it is a freaking Jam just glad to night it's a good chorus and it's a good set of vocals too and the q-tip features on the two versions of trying to survive in the big city oh we're great as well I thought the party version was a little more lively and a little more fun and upbeat but but still though I mean I wish it was maybe relegated as a bonus track or something like that or optional if you picked up the deluxe version of this album because again I feel like this records potency is is watered down by its overstate welcomed because there are a lot of tracks on here that I think are a little unnecessary a little filler ish and there are many more songs that like that surveillance escape track while this is a fun little sketch and sort of paints this picture of dame being chased down by the anti FUNKER x' it's a six-minute long novelty cut that really pads this album out longer than it needs to be and there are a lot of overly long songs on this record it's almost as if Dame tried to write an album of extended dance mixes and I appreciate that he has a love for that side of sin function at 12-inch single format trying to put together an album of those tracks is a little unnecessary I feel like when I hit the three or four-minute mark of a lot of these longer songs the point has been made the idea Illustrated you're not really adding anything to the song by making it eight or nine minutes still though I hear a lot of talent on this record I think Dame is a character and I think he makes some great music and pulls together some good productions and I think as far as the genre goes he has great taste which i think is why he continues to make such interesting music within this style this sub-genre of funk but I think if he's going to come out with a record in the style that hits hard he's gonna need to as they say kill some of his babies and just come through with something a little bit more direct because right now his all-inclusive approach to what he puts onto his records makes his music hard to digest sometimes when it really doesn't necessarily need to be I mean a few of these longer tracks a few of these weirder tracks here and there is completely fine and tracks like glide tonight are in my opinion cyntha I mean total like hit potential on that track it's a great tune I think this record could just use a little bit more I guess more of a concise approach though I still like it again I think a lot of talent on this record I think Dame funk is a great musician and someone who's next album I'm most definitely looking forward to I'm feeling a light decent seven on this thing transition have you given this tracker to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Dame funk forever 
q6t5wV7xmVM,"hi everyone much to me fan tofu here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Travis Scott record rodeo oh yeah Travis Scott is a southern rapper and producer who sort of blew up came out of nowhere as a kanye protege earning a few production credits on Kanye's last big commercial release Jesus and after earning this Kanye West bump Travis Scott did not take his time with releasing his own music right there in 2013 he had it ready that Owl Pharaoh EP mixtape project I thought this project was like just wall-to-wall dull and if Kanye was grifting any ideas off of Travis in the studio they were being altered to the point of like being nearly unrecognizable if they were landing on yeezus either that are just given like this really high gloss finish so that they sounded just a little bit more commercial project ready I guess the owl Farrow stuff maybe the budget wasn't as high I don't know I'm Travis's following project days before rodeo this was the big teaser mixtape bringing us to this rodeo project he did very little of the production on here at least from what I can tell from the credits which at that point what like why like what what are you what are you doing here like aren't you supposed to be the superstar producer why are you not producing on your own records I just didn't get it because he certainly wasn't bringing it on the rapping and the lyricism just the the flow side of things Travis wasn't really coming across as this superstar really great attention grabbing voice as far as sound quality goes days before rodeo definitely sounded better but at this point I just didn't really see Travis's potential like with days before rodeo and with Alfaro I I thought the catchiest thing Travis had written was that pretty cool straight-up ad-lib even with his 3500 single which featured 2 Chainz and in future I thought the production was heavy it was pretty luscious Travis's bars didn't really blow me away or anything that future and to chain sort of did their thing it sounded decent the hook was definitely stand out but the song standing at seven minutes I think really killed its single potential so admittedly I wasn't really that excited for this project but then I read into the production credits on this thing which you can see here and they are pretty impressive as you can see some pretty awesome names listed out in this thing including Wonder Girl and Pharrell and then I caught the features list which had Kanye West even Justin Bieber quavo of me goes to chains at future as I said Ti does some of the like really strange dramatic spoken-word bits on the album here Juicy J and Toro y Moi who Travis has done music with before land on this record - so interest piqued and while I don't think this record is perfect I do feel like Travis has come into his own a great deal on this album and and I hear a specific idea and sound and kind of concept coming through on Rodeo I think Travis has essentially taken that New Atlantis sound from artists like future and og MACO and me goes from young thug and to an extent Chief Keef all of the druggie lyrics the trap influenced percussion the kind of wavy slow-mo sounds the auto-tune the hedonism the the ballads the singing and also the kind of gimmicky ad-libs in the background I think he's taken a little bit of a cue from the last ASAP ferg album trap Lord as well with some of the very cavernous production some of the very deep and and gorgeous reverbs that are on some of these vocals here but mostly Travis is borrowing from and focusing on this this new generation of Atlanta bass artists and he's kind of grabbing their respective sound which he's always been influenced by to a great degree being from Houston himself I mean he's he's probably deep into the world of southern hip-hop there's no doubt about that so he's grabbing this sound and he's kind of elevating it to this really beautiful artsy level and really making it kind of album worthy like this style of music I think has led to a lot of great singles a lot of smash singles a lot of club bangers some decent mixtapes too but rarely are these very same artists actually delivering commercial records that live up to the hype of these singles recently I could think of futures dirty sprite - as an example which for what it was doing sounded like a very aesthetically cohesive record kind of artsy in its own right with all of its very woozy druggie slow-mo sounds but futures singing and rapping and lyricism has its limitations future is not that great of a lyricist he's not even really a good singer the tracks didn't really develop in the way that you would want a good song to develop but development is what Travis has plenty of on rodeo surprisingly Travis actually NAB's the the melody from futures rich sex go back and listen to that track and then listen to the second half of the song oh my and and this side it's the same goddamn melody but Travis actually extends it out a little bit and turns it into a tune and not just this redundant dumbed down melodic phrase that gets tiresome by the time the song is over the singing on this track even though it is heavily auto-tuned and on the the first half with the song oh my it's very expressive it's not like the auto-tune is just kind of covering up all the human elements of the voice Travis uses auto-tune in a really effective manner throughout this record only in a few moments do I think it actually because is to the detriment of this record record record and this track oh my / decide actually features one of Travis as many beat shifts right in the middle of the song and while in the past I didn't really enjoy what he was doing with these beat shifts because we were just going from one weak idea to another weak idea I think on this record I actually started to enjoy it not because the B shifts were all that well orchestrated sometimes like on the song night or two one no they're kind of weak like we just kind of get this fade up of the next beat seems a little you know thrown together but at least the respective halves the respective sides to each song the the the track we're transitioning from in the in the track we're transitioning to our good yeah I said it and I and I seriously mean I think oh my is a fantastic song and a great start to this record it's so cavernous it's so dark it's so eerie I love that oh just gives me a chilly chill chill and how we kind of moved from this just very dark just nocturnal trap ballad to this very just pretty kind of glamorous trap R&B tune is is very sweet it's very cool it's like a very warm embrace after a very dark cold freezing night both sides of this track are incredibly intoxicating potent pretty to the ear I love the intricacies of the production some of the synth leads on the second half of this track are gorgeous beautiful just really great beats on this thing and qwave owes contributions to the first half in the second half of this track are great to him and Travis actually have quite a bit of chemistry together and I like how this track is showing us different sides of Travis Scott - we had this monstrous darkness on one half of this song the whole thing kicks off with the track named pornography which kind of builds the album up to be this epic the bit of a personal story of Travis's come up and the second half of this track shows Travis being kind of personal and a little nostalgic I mean we're not exactly getting like a life story here but it certainly feels like Travis is starting to use his music to come out of his shell and say something a little bit more personal which he does again on the sec half of nine oh two one oh a moment we're actually feel quite a bit of heart coming through on Travis's lyrics over this very glamorous boom backbeat which features these really awesome grand pianos and I actually don't mind the kind of pornstar themed ballad that kicks the whole track off I actually think it's another example of Travis taking that auto-tune backed atl balladry and kind of elevating it because if you isolate everything else out of the tune aside from the auto-tune vocals and what Travis is singing lyrically the instrumental leader is actually gorgeous I mean the spacious drums the the female vocals on this track are wonderful I don't know who's singing them they seem to be uncredited if you want to put that down there in the comments that would be greatly appreciated but the vocals the guest vocals on this track are wonderful they sound awesome it's kind of like I'm actually listening to this fusion of like a really tender delicate art pop song and like I don't know like a migos track or something it's crazy at this point on the record traps is coming like dangerously close to perfectly embodying that whole idea that whole notion of like high-end highbrow just high class ignorance something I think someone like Kanye has tried to push in his music before at least the idea of that with song specifically off of like the cruel summer mixtape Reaper but I think Travis pulls it off maybe a little bit better because while his instrumentals and his songs do sound very melodic and very fleshed out an artsy in a sense his music still maintains like that street vibe that Street grittiness to it that I think sort of a more established industry rapper wouldn't necessarily be able to pull off because they're not as close to that lifestyle they're not as close to that background as someone like Travis's he is just coming from that world and the sound that represents that world is fresh in his mind because he's living it as a young artist one of the other things that I like about the instrumental on this track are the little layers of guitars that are very quiet but adds so much character to some of these instrumentals when they do pop up kind of like in the last third of the 3,500 instrumental a track that I'm enjoying so much more in the context of this record though I still wish it was a little shorter a little bit punchier going deeper into the tracklist we have the incredibly sinister track wasted with Juicy J I think it's really grimy it's got a lot of different parts to it I think there may be a few spots here that kind of feel like a bit of dead air with the instrumental and like not too much going on lyrically but you know still it's a pretty decent track a very dark moment on the record the song pray for love with the weakened is definitely a lower point on the record for me but not because of the weekend as some of you may assume it's actually one of the few moments where I wish Travis let up on the vocal effects a little bit because Abel is a really capable singer and he can definitely hold his own he doesn't need to be so heavily layered in effects it's definitely ear grabbing at the very intro of this track but once the bridge comes in and we get the whole like sort of ascending vocal part and we have one vocal effect on top of another vocal effect on top of another vocal effect and it just becomes too much and and I think the the very nice and sharp musical arrangements that are being sort of orchestrated this bridge in the song are kind of being smothered by the fact the vocals sound so horrendous because of all the effects on every multitrack vocal still though I like the instrumental on this track - I like the dark building beat kind of reminded me of what Kanye has been doing recently on his own solo stuff and sort of makes me think you know is this the kind of artistry that Kanye wanted in his own music and that's why we're kind of seeing it come to light on this record over here is this sort of stuff Travis Scott was bringing to the table during those easiest sessions or is this just something that he's picking up because he was in on those sessions and obviously the the influence that him and Kanye have going for each other it's obviously a two-way street I think we get back to more effective songwriting on the track I call with Swale e of drummers ear I'm not pronouncing that backwards and also chief keef it is a pretty decent tune I wish it had a grander intro like many other songs here do rather than just kind of you know fading in which was a little bit of a disappointment but this track does have one of the more winning choruses on the entire record yeah I get that there's not really too much to this track lyrically you know it's not deep or anything like that but I think it kind of takes this whole notion of you know this late-night hedonism and debauchery to this really kind of very pretty woozy intoxicating sort of aesthetic again I pushed the idea that this is trying to make that hedonism this is trying to make that ATL sound just sound a little more melodic a little artsy or a little bit more refined and a little bit more grim not groomed for radio but groomed so that the flavor isn't getting lost as you listen to it from the start of an album to the end of an album sort of adding these wonderful melodic intricacies to the instrumentals so that these tracks are actually not one-dimensional channel channel so while sway Lee and Chief Keef might not exactly be saying anything deep on this track I do appreciate their verses especially chief Keef's for being as just kind of direct and is blunt as they are which is especially the case on the song piss on Your Grave which takes a little time to get started with this weird psych Rock intro but once it really begins you kind of hear Kanye's yeah a lot of people were really excited for this song because they wanted to hear Kanye it sounds a lot like a track that could have landed on uses honestly because vocally it sounds like Kanye is still going down that same road that he was on use as sort of that whole I am of God kind of thing which I believe is the track that travis co-produced off of jesus and i'm not so sure if the song has a left over a lot of people have alleged that but i think Kanye is coming off way more extreme than he was on some of those uses tracks and on some of his recent features this feature seems just like way more over the top than any feature he's done as of late which in a sense I found refreshing although it did kind of feel like a bit of a temper tantrum but ultimately what does end up making this song a bit of a low point for me on the record is the songwriting wise there clearly was not as much effort here as there was on many other tracks here Travis and Kanye like trade a few bars here and there they show some decent chemistry but the song isn't really here on this track though you know again I do kind of appreciate this track for kind of the energy shift at this point in the tracklist which is something you've got to pay attention to because it's it's very clear that Travis put a lot of effort into the flow of this record after this song though the the the hits on this album I think continued the track antidote which does have this redundant little vocal melody but I do love the beat and I love how heavy and I love how bassy it is again it's another woozy intoxicating moment it hits so hard but it feels like I'm in the midst of a dream state my one complaint about this track is that I think by the mid point we're really struggling for lyrics we're really struggling for things to say I don't know I get that we're not trying to say anything deep on this record but it at least say something catchy or memorable or something still there's some wonderful moments on this instrumental the the bridge has these wonderful synths on and Travis's verse toward the back end of this track isn't really bad either I like the song impossible directly after which is kind of like this groovy alluring dream sequence on the record and and lyrically like a bit of a monologue for Travis where he's talking about his his dreams his ambitions I guess his his worries his stresses it's kind of like this weird little internal monologue moment on the record and with the track Maria I'm drunk we have this beautiful little vocal intro and then immediately we go into this track with young thug and Justin Bieber song that for many is probably going to be the most hated on the record Justin Bieber young thug potentially a train wreck I mean not really two names a lot of people want to hear on a record but songwriting wise this is one of my favorite tracks on the entire album not only is the refrain of this track killer but I think young thug's voice on this track is awesome I think a lot of people  on young thug because they're holding him up to this rapper rubric when he couldn't even be further from trying to attempt to to live up to that standard I just kind of see him as a singer guy yeah there's something about his voice that is just so dynamic and all over the place on this track that really just pulls me in and Justin Bieber when he comes on a while I mean yeah it's Justin Bieber I think he fits into the aesthetic of the record really well I don't think he does anything on his verse that likes Whaley wasn't doing earlier on the record so if you just hate his verse just because it's Justin Bieber then I mean I don't really know what to tell you I'm not really in love with it it's not a high point for me on the record but he didn't stick out like a sore thumb or anything which is maybe all I could have really asked for Justin he just wants to know what that booty do I and the dreary little piano line and that freakin ass Sydney bass line up both awesome both GUI and the record finishes off relatively strong to the very evil and melodic I can tell is haunting very haunting and the song apple pie is kind of like a warm goodbye with Travis kind of saying farewell to his mother and his old life and it's it's really just kind of a tune of becoming self-sufficient and going out there on your own and and taking that risk and becoming your own man really and even though I wish this album had a grander finish in in a way it did kind of feel like a fitting cliffhanger I feel like we kind of got a little bit of a picture of who Travis's and kind of how he's growing as an artist and and sort of what he's trying to do and Ti does a pretty decent job at various points of this record kind of enhance saying that story and adding a bit of poetry here and there and adding a bit of drama and at the very end of this record kind of exposing to the audience exactly what the whole meaning and concept behind the idea of the the rodeo is and before I move into the final moment of the review I do want to mention that flying high is another track on this record that I enjoy a lot to Tora moi is is featured on this track and what a like a surprisingly creative and good and cohesive meld of Travis's and Tony maws respective styles this is like a sun-drenched Beach ready banger and the way Chaz's vocals kind of soar over the the chorus on this thing of that sort of thing they sound fun they sound sweet they sound great and Travis just sounds so relaxed and laid-back and charismatic on this track and I love the bass and I love the twittering hi-hats on this thing it's it's a solid cut man and a nice kind of banger to help the last leg of this record and yeah I mean I'm just kind of floored I thought this record was really good I thought it was really really good I was surprisingly good I did not anticipate Travis Scott to come through with something that I really enjoyed as much as I enjoy as this thing I often have been returning to this record since I've had it and I've been like doing really like this do I really like this I'm sure I like this and yeah I'm pretty sure I like it I think what Travis is doing with this ATL sound this southern sound right here on this record is very interesting and I think he's doing a lot of these southern artists these newer southern artists I think is doing a lot of these trap artists a lot of these you know trap balladeers a service by putting this sound to a full-length album that is for the most part enjoyable from front to back a few lulls here and there a few weak tracks here and there but I think Travis put together solid project and did a great job of bringing on a lot of artists that are representative of this sound so that we have kind of like a communal celebration of this style of this musical trend right here and again set to instrumentals and and tunes that are a little more artful and a little more accessible and a little bit more intricate kit I didn't really like his past two projects at all and I feel like the difference between what he's done over the past few years and what he did here is like night and day and some of the some of the changes that he's made to his style and his sound have been very miniscule on some of these songs but they've made all the difference I'm feeling a 8 on this thing transitioned did you think of this record it's bedtime it's bedtime good night "

4J4GjCE_KPw,no no don't do it don't Pappa Miley don't pop about you Anthony you don't get it do it you don't get it do it Jason stop Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Miley Cyrus record Miley and Cyrus and her dead pets Miley Cyrus is an internationally known pop star who started off as a child star the daughter of mr. Billy Ray Cyrus himself and was famously for quite a while Hannah Montana had huge hits under her own name like party in the USA but sort of when she came of age she started to change her image in the media to this kind of edgier sexier more in-your-face type of pop star and a lot of controversy has been stirred since that change everything from her very revealing music videos to her elaborate and vulgar stage shows Miley is just really over the top right now it's just how she sells herself it's how she markets herself she's just really sexual really loves to smoke marijuana and just puts that in your face all the time for people who are just like sheltered white teenagers or who were sheltered white teenagers at one time I'm sure she comes off very very edgy and that edginess manifested itself musically in the Bangerz record she was dropping around the time she was initially making this image makeover and now she's kind of been riding off the hype of that record for a while been doing a lot of touring a lot of live shows again her stage show is absolutely nuts and now recently she seems to have kind of picked up a little bit more attention in that she was given a spot to host at the VMAs which I mean kind of makes sense given that during previous VMAs she has consistently been like the most tweeted about the most I guess controversial thing of the VMAs show so I figure MTV was thinking well you know if Miley is always the most high thing on the VMAs as of late let's just make her the host let's just put her on the VMAs from front to back not that this is super important to me but this relates to this new album over here because during this stage show Miley played a new song called do it which in part was created by The Flaming Lips and they were actually on the stage with her playing this song and this track is off of this new record which she released simultaneously the night of her recent VMAs performance it's a 90-minute record Mike will made it had a huge part in the production on this album Wayne Coyne and the Flaming Lips had a huge part in the music on this album and Miley is singing on every track here and there a couple features here as well in this 90-minute record the vocalists from Phantogram appears big sean is on a track and even Ariel pink makes an appearance on this record it seemed like a totally star-studded event for anybody who was into indie music and alternative music and psychedelic music and also into kind of the the weirder tunes coming out of pop music right now I mean Mike will made it he's a reputable producer and I I was excited going into this record because right now our pop stars in in in pop music seem really volatile while they do chase a lot of trends simultaneously there's kind of this really weird freedom right now where people like Miley Cyrus can drop records like this out of the blue for everyone to hear and you know really I guess have no fear in whether or not this record kind of breaks her career and I guess that pressure isn't really there like it used to be because this album is kind of free for anyone to stream there wasn't this big commercial rollout for this album so it's not like there was a huge budget and trying to promote this record or anything like that it seems like her and Wayne and company we're kind of making this album because they wanted to make it and just release it to the public I guess for the love of creating the music that was on this project at least I hope so I figured going into this thing Miley Wayne and company they're taking a big risk on this record so they must really like what's going on with this album they must think that they came together with something really risky really experimental really out there and just really worth it I mean Miley and and and The Flaming Lips have been pretty supportive of one another over the past few years it's kind of interesting to see that support developing into a record in such a long record - and the first few tracks on this record actually showed a little bit of promise I think the production I think musically the song oh no is actually pretty fantastic it just reeks of Flaming Lips influence and even though I don't really care for Miley's lyrics they're a little basic they kind of stink of that stench that I usually get from a Miley Cyrus song that like oh man she's really trying real hard to be edgy really trying really making the effort to get that edge out there okay you you you smoke pot so does everyone else no one cares and the following track is actually a kind of Spacey melodic beautiful and enchanting little ballot kind of dream pop ish definitely has a Flaming Lips vibe as well and I will say that even the songs that that have that kind of a you know the Mike will made it watermark playing right at the beginning of the track do kind of have a weird oddball psychedelic quality to them too there's not really a spot on this record where Miley breaks the consistently dreamy and psychedelic vibe of this album maybe a punchy track here and there there are a few piano ballads toward the back end of this album but it's consistently very textured very sound driven I mean it's it's Flaming Lips and that's what they're doing the best of these days on their newest records so you got to expect a lot of sound a lot of interesting textures going into these songs however while we're on the topic of songs the quality of the songs actually take an incredible nosedive right after the second track I would say just about everything except the sounds of this album take a nosedive especially the singing something about space dude that track the singing on this track is god-awful and I'd never thought Miley Cyrus was a good singer I've always thought she was a mediocre singer and putting yourself in this context where there's no glitz there's no high-gloss production kind of surrounding her the recording here is surprisingly raw for somebody who is a pop artist or her level of popularity so it's really raw and without I guess that safety net her voice sounds god-awful and ridiculous and again just that that stench of trying so hard to be so edgy EPP so obnoxious that it's hard to even appreciate the good things that are going on in some of these instrumentals which for the most part stagnate after the first 30 seconds or minute or so of each track here because there's not really that strong of a sense of songwriting on these tracks there's really boring choruses they don't really transition that much or contrast that much from the even more boring verses but each track on here does manage to I guess be terrible in its own unique way like the song bebe talk which is a throw a trash piece of generic pop punctuated by this really angsty stoner babble that I can't imagine anyone would really want to listen to and then we have the song freaky which is another atmospheric ballad absolutely terrible and Miley singing on this track she sounds like she's doing a bad Lana Del Rey impression except she's even more sloshed than Lana Del Rey has ever sounded on a track and is slurring her words even more with some awful lyrics some really awful lyrics she really makes a lot of del rey on this track sound like listening to fucking Shakespeare the lines about hey I just smoked a bull and I'm just keeping it real and let's go to my room and but I guess even completely Hollow and and shallow people need sad emotional songs to the song bang me like a box Wow this fucking track this was vulgar as fuck and while I do love vulgar music I do love a good sex song I cannot really separate the artists from the art on this track listening to Miley in her incredibly gross voice which does not sound womanly or sexy or sensual at all and again I mean I do like some hard raunchy sex I really do but listening to Miley talk about this stuff makes me want to become you know like a born-again Christian so I can grab my virginity back and just live the rest of my life a sexless husk it's like The Flaming Lips are enabling Miley to embark on all of these really awful just in bad taste beachhouse impressions that absolutely have no attention paid toward good songwriting good melodies great vocals or quality lyrics when this album isn't grossing me out or offending my tastes it's absolutely boring sort of like on the track Cyrus skies although this song actually becomes pretty excruciating as it goes along the instrumentation and Miley's voice very somber very quiet very easygoing but as Miley reaches up into her upper register and starts singing more intensely I kind of feel like I have just you know I want to escape where where am i I feel like I've walked into a giant trash compactor without completely understanding where exactly I am and then all of a sudden the walls are closing in on me and I'm like I know I want out of here the song I'm so drunk we know and then the song I forgive you that this track is really interesting it's like a combination of if you live in the city you might know a woman who makes like six figures a year selling bored housewives on like you know these homeopathic Eastern medicines and teaches a yoga class and is always saying namaste all the time it's like a combination of that lady with this new generations kind of like type of personality and and these two personas when they come together it's like bleach and ammonia you just don't want to breathe it because death is imminent the upside of this record though is that I think in a weird sense miley is finally making music that's authentically her it's garish it's hard to look at every second that you spend with it is like one little regret and they just kind of pile up over time and then to add insult to injury there are all these really vacant appeals to oneness and and peace man she's the kind of person who would really appeal to somebody who doesn't really know how to be themselves and doesn't know what being yourself is like and these very same people will come to Miley's defensibility hey man hey that's just Miley man that's just Miley being her she's just doing her bro hey man hey that's just Bozo the Clown man that's just Bozo the Clown he's just being him man that's just bozo he's doing him dude yeah the song lighter is essentially this really boring karaoke session over some 80 sounding drums and synthesizers it's trash throw it in the recycle bin then we have the song one son Miley thank you for the horrible Lady Gaga impression and the piano ballad Pablo the Blowfish which I appreciate because it's a fucking vegan song that's pretty cool vegan song not bad however the lyrics here are awful as well not only are they kind of silly with moments where Pablo is going to go into the ocean and sleep with a seahorse named Sadie which Miley acknowledges is ridiculous but at this point it just kind of seems like the humor is is kind of lost on me I mean the album has been so bad up until this point do we really need a joke I don't know Plus also Miley's piano playing on this track is about as basic as hell it's like the skill of a somebody who's been learning to play piano for like six months or so and is she like really crying on this track I don't know but uh immediately after the song is over she's like laughing you know sometimes Miley will come through with these emotional moments and then we'll put her foot in her mouth immediately after by saying something stupid either on this track or on the very end of do it which again had a tolerable instrumental you know I was thinking hey this isn't bad it's okay but he's like why they put the Duke in the pussy why did put the dick get a bush why they put the dick in the pussy why he put the Nick gonna pussy fuck you the Tibetan bowls track is actually pretty hilarious because it sounds Maile was pretty intimate with a bowl before recording this song but not a Tibetan one but there was an interesting little I guess drone going on in the background here and on top of Miley is trying to woo us with her siren song it's a pretty excruciating and of the closer here another piano ballad where Miley is just screaming her brains out singing about these dreams that she's having and not only does the song get downright funny when she is just really reaching up there and it's funny because well Miley seemed so determined to get the meaning of these dreams that she's talking about yet she's like put very little to any meaning into any of the songs that she's released on this record I guess that's why she's searching for meaning because she's actually like looking for something I don't know of note or remotely interesting to say or sing she actually fails to bring up an interesting lyrical point for 90 minutes that's that's which is an accomplishment I guess I mean it's really hard to be this boring for 90 minutes you know you'd figure you would do something interesting accidentally at one point so know this this record wasn't good it was actually pretty terrible not a single song here was worth listening to all the way through the performances were terrible the songs weren't there the lyrics I mean Miley's voice is kind of buried in the background so much you could ignore them a lot of the time but once you zero in on them I don't know what's probably gonna come to your mind is what does it what does it make just fuck it strong one hi everyone its Antoine Phan Tuan here you know who it is I am reminding you right now that we have a brand

GI6S--qXc2M,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new foals record what went down foals are an indie pop and rock outfit from the UK whose music I haven't really been that into since their dance Punk days when they came out with their full-length debut record and since the release of that album the band suddenly transitioned into a much more mellow shimmering sound which the band seems to have taken to because they've stuck pretty passionately to it since the release of total life forever although it hasn't really done too much for me and in regards to their last full length album holy fire while I don't recall liking that record and I went back to my review and saw that I was pretty indifferent to the album overall I could barely recall a single song from it so I don't know I mean I really enjoyed their debut I really did and and I feel like somewhere in there the same lively energetic exciting band is has got to be hidden inside of the atmosphere and engines and such as the dreary downtrodden but kind of danceable sound that they're delivering on their recent records that same group has to be in there somewhere somewhere somewhere and on the surface there's really nothing too strange or unusual about this album for foals it's a 10 track record it runs about 49 minutes and their sound on this album isn't really overhauled or anything like that the band is still delivering music with this kind of laid-back and mellow and chill and somewhat moody vibe to it but the instrumentation is is very tight they're very clean moody vocals on a lot of these songs shimmering echoed guitar leads some very warm resonant bass lines and bustling drums and a lot of the songs on this record are pretty drawn-out not a single track here is under 4 minutes in length foals definitely take their time with a lot of these songs but the first track on this album though presents a pretty big change it's easily one of the heaviest most thrilling and explosive songs foals have released in a long time the guitar riffs on this thing are crushing the driving ours in the thick base and even the vocals really turned it up a few notches and it was just thrilling it was a straightforward rock song with a lot of weight to it reminded me a lot of Queens of the Stone Age a little bit really it's the first third of this record where I think foals bring quite a bit of bite to the table even some of the more easygoing songs in the first third of this record have some edge to them the second track and the track listing here is much prettier much smoother than the opener but the vocals still bring quite a bit of fire in the verses and there's a sharp chorus on this track too foals are writing more up songs on this album and I like it and there was a nice pre-chorus build in the second half of this track - there's some good structures here and I like the very chilly and nocturnal instrumental on the song birch tree - the way the bustling drums and the pulsating synthesizers build the track up toward its finish is really nice in the second half of this record the song snake-oil has some more heavy riffs that read a little bit like something Tom Morello would do but not like raging as the Maschine era Tom Morello more like Audioslave era Tom Morello and the song night swimmers with its drums and bass has a really sharp groove as well but around the midpoint of this record I feel like foals dull tendencies tend to get the better of them and start taking over these tracks at the start it's just kind of like a great hot steamy bath that just gets colder and colder and colder as the album moves along I would say by the middle of the record it's pretty lukewarm especially by the time the song Albatros rolls into town the band starts delivering tracks that could have interchangeably worked on their past two records which I didn't really care for and the end of the album I think foals actually start delivering some of their least interesting tracks the song London Thunder the most understated track in the track listing here has no strong flavor to it no real bold or memorable anything and I'm not really sure if the band consciously tried - sound like Coldplay as much as they actually do on the closing track here it literally sounds like a Coldplay song it's it's a Coldplay song just like fulls kind of doing their own take on what they think would be a Coldplay song although I will give them props for the song lonely hunter which I think has one of the sharpest melodies on the entire record I understand why some people might be excited about this record a few tracks here do bring a pretty bold and exciting an interesting change of pace for foals but that change of pace that experimentation that venturing out into just different territory doesn't last for not even half of the record it's really just a handful of standout songs where it seems like foals take a few loud and and in-your-face risks and they pay off but a bulk of this album just kind of feels like foals as usual as far as their last two records go while the finishing tracks are some of the most drab songs yet I mean even iTunes was selling this as their heaviest album yet which I mean yeah if you only listened to the first two songs the rest of it just kind of seems like foals as usual and the band is kind of just folding their arms and refusing to progress or mature or experiment or advance in any kind of significant way I'm feeling a light - decent five on this thing transition have you given the tracker - listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana foals forever 
afa0WF6Ln44,hi everyone new the York oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Kraus record yin ah these guys are in New York metal band this is their latest full-length LP they have really fantastic musicians in the band most notably mr. Colin Marston as well as mr. Mick bar both guitarists and metal songwriters extraordinaire and collectively these guys have been contributing to the New York experimental metal scene for years and years and years through either production or numerous bands and projects just too many to name we're not going to get too deep into it right now but crannis is one of the longest-running entities Marsten and bar have ever been involved in but it seems like on this new record in order to keep the beast alive they've had to change its genetic makeup a little bit crownless is no longer simply the sort of progressive atmosphere black metal band that they've been for years this new record over here doesn't so much feel like a black metal record feels more like a technical and progressive metal record with some black metal undertones which i think is fine there's no outright reason to reject this change just from the get-go but there are a few things about this album that are surprisingly different when comparing what Krauss is doing here to their earlier stuff for one this is a pretty short record it's just about 35 minutes so you're not really getting the lengthy drawn-out winding compositions that you may have heard on Krause's previous output and for whatever reason not one not two not three but four songs in the track listing here clock in at 6 minutes and 41 seconds they even fade out one track or fade in one track in order to keep this length thing up and the songs on this record don't really progress with the same kind of consistent fluidity that was featured on Krauss as earlier output to a lot of the songs on here feature these really jumpy ever-changing riffs that are very fast very nimble very dizzying they are often crashing into one another or just changing very rapidly violently rapidly the songs can be kind of hard to keep track of sometimes however it's not like things get so technical or showy that these tracks are impossible to digest like many other projects Marsten and Barr have been involved in in the past where they were ultra progressive ultra technical ultra experimental and while this Krauss record isn't completely a reflection of projects like behold the arcticus it certainly seems like bar and Marston are moving a little bit in that direction however this record doesn't read simply as this weird out there metal experiment it's still very visceral and sometimes exciting record and there are quite a few tremolo Pickett ARS on these tracks as well as blast beats so at least there there is some kind of consistency going on here and the vocal deliveries are kind of the screamed shouted growl or the kind of stuff that that you might have caught on their last full-length album not quite the black metal vocal delivery you might have heard them delivering early on in their discography the thing they won this album is that is that the change Krauss presents here isn't really that bad for the most part it's interesting I just wish it was a little longer and a little well orchestrated and organized at times the guitars and the drums sound a little jumbled I wish the bass had a bit more presence I wish the vocals played a larger role in making these songs catchy and memorable a lot of the times with Krauss the vocals kind of feel like a bit of an afterthought and with all the winding guitar passages on their previous albums being so epic being so huge maybe the vocals didn't really need to play that large of a role but here maybe I'm kind of feeling like there's a bit more weight put on them they got to do something still though Krauss making the conscious decision to write shorter faster songs has caused them to come out with a very no BS record they're playing aggressive as hell on this album and some of the tracks here are actually laced with some pretty awesome melodies especially on tracks like idols where the opening guitar lines on this track are actually very dreary and beautiful or they're really bright burning and dramatic and and wonderfully layered guitar leads on the song tyranny of thought I loved those to Crowley's bring some cool stuff to the table and the track listing here but the thing is by the track tyranny of thought by the time that this album really starts defining itself stylistically the record starts to tailspin into a really abrupt end with a handful of tracks that that kind of feel like they weren't structured that well or put together that well or and kind of abruptly as abruptly as this album the record just runs out of gas which is kind of weird because of how aggressive it is again I think Crowley's came through with an interesting record this time around I just think this album kind of presented a change it presented a new sound that they didn't really commit to for that long of a time I think the brevity of this record along with the kind of messy production on some of these tracks doesn't really reflect the care and the quality level and the cohesion that we've heard on previous Crowell s albums this record while I do think it presents an interesting change of pace it's a little disheveled which is why I'm feeling kind of a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this record of listened if you have what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should are you next and that's it Anthony Santana crass forever 
9ubqxYOvCGQ,no no hi everyone so theny sad tanto here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the most harmful and problematic segment on this youtube channel the why you know review where i essentially talk about a brief a series of albums that i didn't get a chance to touch down on in a sort of full-length review this past month but i kind of wanted to talk about them a little bit here and um yeah you know let's just try to get through this without hurting ourselves shall we oily Oh wonderful ice-cold melon aid it's alright it's alright it's alright it's alright it's alright but it could have been great if the production and the mixing were actually uh not so messy it's like the breathy soulless singing of Lana Del Rey set to circus music and dressed up in like some doll house clothes we have another colorfully dressed completely faceless popstar landing on top of a bunch of synthetic overly atmospheric instrumentals with a voice that is totally unrecognizable and just nondescript completely nondescript do we need another one of these I know they're they're still doing a good job here but I just I'm just not that into it I I think it's I think it's me more overproduced indie prog yeh more color by the numbers metalcore yeah a pretty interesting turn of events here for Lee on this record rather than making electronic music hip hop music or many of the other genres of music that he's produced in the past he is a very versatile producer is actually making some pretty experimental electronic music here as well as ambient music and each track on this record reads a lot like the cover of this album a very crisp close gorgeous photo with vibrant colors but you can't make out exactly what it is or what it's trying to do some of the songs on here are pretty enthralling pretty beautiful but many other tracks in the track listing here just kind of feel like these fleeting motifs that don't really strike me as interesting in any kind of significant way I'm glad that Lee is experimenting though I just don't think this album is like enthralling from beginning to end so I'm pretty cool and mostly very chill and melodic math rock on this record with some decent vocals here and there felt maybe a little underwhelming across the length of the whole record though I know there are a lot of other people out there that appreciate math Rock much more than I do so I do want to give this album kind of a little endorsement here and say do check this out if you are into math rock because there are some legitimately beautiful and cool moments in the tracklisting here and the playing is very solid the the instrumentals on this album are a very intricate however they don't take the virtuosity of their playing in these songs so far that the performance has actually become annoying or anything like that it's a it's not bad how do i download this to do it do I have to put my address in here I don't really want to this is the latest album from a very prolific black metal project whose sound typically is incredibly noisy hideous and kind of disturbing sometimes although on this record in this instance we actually hear some guests and arrange instrumentation thrown into the mix specifically from some pretty heavily layered string sections although with the kind of messy smudgy recording that you might find on another tongueless record the string was really kind of end up cancelling out some of the ferocity and some of the abrasiveness that you typically get out of this project but also the strings kind of feel canceled out by the ugliness of the guitars and aren't really recorded or mixed that well so they sound kind of muddy it just kind of seems like the two major elements here on this record are kind of working against each other rather than enhancing one another this is a pretty decent pop rock record a lot like his debut album which I surprisingly liked and put on my year-end list at the end of the year despite having not reviewed it and occasionally returned to because I think it is a very good pop rock record and this one runs the same although I don't really particularly feel all that drawn to it at the moment maybe I'm not really in the mood for it but I also think it has a lot to do with how over produced this album sounds this guy is a singer-songwriter who's not just a little bit country but also a little bit rock and roll and they've got kind of a vintage recording style to this record over here that reads a lot like Alabama Shakes when they first came out and a lot like Alabama Shakes I think they have a lot going for them although I think they do kind of drown in their vintage aesthetic a little bit and don't bring forward that strong of a personality although I think that that could be very easily alleviated with some stronger songs and some stronger vocal performances too with a little bit more personality something a little more distinct or a little bit more animalistic or a little more wild there are a few decent singles off of this thing and yeah I mean I I hope that they just come out with more vibrant music on their next release and that is the y-you know review this time out of those those pretty painless cool cool transition have you given any of these records a listen if you have did you love them did you hate them why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana while you know review forever 
wrEf-GoWq54,hi everyone right than anything and oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new dear Dorian record expanding flower planet angel Dara Dorian is a singer-songwriter mostly a singer known for the incredible vocals that she has lent to many a Dirty Projectors record the indie and experimental rock and pop act whose music you should familiarize yourself with if you don't know who they is but she's actually lent guest vocals to a lot of other people's songs and and records too you might have caught her on a roots record or the latest Flying Lotus record and she also dropped a solo EP in 2009 although actually didn't hear that EP and I'm not really too familiar with the music on it however I didn't really want to dive too deeply into it before I did this review because I didn't want to go into this album with too many expectations plus it's also been six years since the release of that EP and I wasn't gonna go into this album assuming that she wanted to do the exact same thing on this record that she was doing on that EP it's it's been so long there were some tracks building up to the release of this album that I thought sounded really great had me looking forward to reviewing it but I'm not reviewing this record alone I have actually invited mr. mark Grondin of spectrum pulse another YouTube music reviewer fellow music critic man on to talk about this album with me and that's essentially what we're gonna do together transition and here we are through the magic of the internet with mr. mark Grondin aka spectrum pulse talking about this new you're a Dorian record with me mark what did you think of this record honestly going in I did not have high expectations but I was pleasantly surprised I actually found more to like about this album than I had otherwise expected what what was it that that sort of made you go into this record and not sort of expect a whole lot well part of it is that I've never really been a huge Dirty Projectors fan I mean I liked a lot of her I liked a lot of her work that she had I liked her voice I thought she's a very distinctive presence behind her I have always had issues of the way the very rejecters wrote songs though and that kind of had me a little bit of verse to it I remember to take a look at the EP that she dropped before bid orchid I thought it was good but nothing was overshadowed by Bette Orca um I also heard the stuff she did with Avery tear on the / effects stuff and again it was okay but I didn't have a lot of expectations going into a full-out solo record whether or not she'd be able to carry it on her own what about you I didn't go into it expecting a whole lot either but but mostly because and I am a Dirty Projectors fan at least a fan of a few of their records there are some records of theirs that I don't really care for too much but but I feel like the role of Angel really really just the role of David sort of seems to be maybe over emphasized a little bit in the creative process of the Dirty Projectors so I think your average fan of that band isn't necessarily looking for solo material or necessarily thinking of people in angel and the group is like you know playing this really super creative role and and and while I don't think this sounds like a Dirty Projectors album I think this album certainly sheds light on - some of the ideas that turn up in their records that I think are really good also uh I guess I do think in a sense that this does kind of feel like I don't know what you would expect out of a somewhat indulgent solo by project you you know like you were saying you do kind of have issues with the way the Dirty Projectors write songs I wouldn't exactly say that angel is the sharpest songwriter I don't really think she's trying to write you know really sharp you know straightforward to sing pop type songs on this record though the tracks kind of seem to have a bit of a psychedelic and meditative appeal with a lot of groovy repetitions that really kind of take their time and you've got to kind of I don't know really let go of yourself and your expectations a little bit kind of get lost in the instrumentals and kind of the very hypnotic instrumentation she needs pulling together here I would mostly agree with you there at least starting off on the way this record goes because that's when I first started to enjoy is when I started this is definitely one that grew on me with time when you had more the instrumentation that was a little bit more it allowed itself to get a little bit looser allowed itself to build build itself to a little bit more energy they had some spots that were a little bit there she but initially described as it being very krautrock inspired particularly by can your end and you can definitely hear it and some in some of the progressions in terms of some of the minimalism that she was going specifically for especially with some of the biggest some one of the more bass heavy tracks that she used to flood out the BAA she's that provide a foundation but not giving a lot of texture that foundation more relying on some very crisp drums that I actually found really quite good sometimes there's some of the kick drums to kind of bug me a little um but when you feel what to attract like comodo for instance that was the one that really first jumped out at me where you had some what did I think but like that was one of those tracks that felt it was the most ed the real that she had gotten to that point and it had that creaking weedy organ to flesh it out had that stocking Menace in the background I thought that really came together well the outro yes did go on a little bit long but I really liked how her voice was multi-tracked on that on that song it really came together well and particularly how her progression on that she was singing in the cross the bridge was then mirrored by that mandolin just sounded really good yakamoto was definitely a track that I kind of listed as one of my favorites on here too and it was also not just because of that really great instrument ation that you mentioned but I thought songwriting wise and vocally it was one of the bolder tracks on the entire album a lot of these songs where I feel like she tends to step back a little vocally and just kind of let the instrumentation you know sort of engage in those krautrock like repetitions did kind of lose themselves on me as she kind of delivered one track after another track after another track in that style and I think it kind of caused the album to route scheme a little bit also the song violent minded and and and maybe one of my favorite moments on the entire record was like the least krautrock ish and that was like the the acoustic ballad at the start of grow I thought her lyrics at that point of the record were really great and I thought just hearing her kind of singing this very straightforward singer-songwriter type manner was really cool and refreshing and on komodo I really liked the and on the second half of grow to I like the sort of really cool nimble vocal acrobatics with those multi tracks that usually here on Dirty Projectors record but I think feel like in the the solo capacity she was able to indulge in that a little bit more and he came out with some really cool experiments and I guess you could say like vocal backflips that I feel like she wouldn't have necessarily done if she was you know trying to fit into a more succinct song kind of the linear song structures on this record kind of allowed her to give the melodic passages here that she was writing a lot of space to kind of you know progress and you know move forward see I would agree with you for at some point except the thing is I really did like her all that much I thought those to me like it had that it had that lo-fi mournful acoustic guitar I liked her writing a lot of that song it did come together to a point I think the questions that it raises kind of run thematically counter to the rest of the album I'll get back to that but I to me that song always felt I don't think the transitioned handled all that well in the mean between yeah I get clunky you know it just seemed really sudden and just really out of the blue you know what while I thought the acoustic intro of grow is really great maybe if she had thought of a way to just kind of really finish out that song and had it sound fantastic this sudden transition into this insane little instrumental passage wouldn't have been necessary and I liked some of the flutes that she brought in I think they're I think all the components were there to make that song work I just don't think they came together as well as as well as they could now the one song that caught me off guard a lot was the eye just because it starts off very it starts off you don't really expect it to develop such a fast-paced group on that song with just fragments of looshing vocals going on a very minimalist tapping melody is the first one that builds to a solid crescendo for me and I'm like this is a song that actually has some pop appeal and I liked the way it fits thematically with the rest of the album and that she's finally reached that moment of transcendence is almost a little bit terrifying in its frenetic intensity but it's all it might be needed likely when you have a more soprano have that bass line when you have that multi-tracking that just inner wolf together so well it really clicked to me probably my favorite track on the album what what what to you is sort of the theme of this out and you're talking about certain points of the records were working against what this record is doing fanatically while I do think there are some strong repetitious characteristics and a lot of these tracks and very meditative very psychedelic like I said yeah still to me the the record on the whole felt a little bit like you know could have a loose change kind of thing you know I it kind of felt like some some just quiet personal indulgences rather than just like a very well groomed and well put together record that is just like very fluid from beginning to end I mean as much as I like tracks like grow I'm not really in love with that song from the standpoint of an outro you know it just seems like so clunky of a song to just kind of finish off the whole record and I would agree with here I think the matically she's trying to excel and some of the lyrics and provided you can make out the lyrics like as much as I think the multi-tracking is very harmonious and has that meditative element that does sound really beautiful she knew the lyrics are not posted anywhere for this album online so trying to decode it required both eight or nine listens for me to really unpack what she was saying a lot of it is symbolically exploring the oneness a lot of it is tying back into very basic Eastern inspired psychedelic themes that honestly the writing doesn't do enough to really flush out and I like that that she's trying to search for that transcendence that oneness that don't you have songs like the opening track which is very much a beautiful woman how she wants to aspire to get to that point and it seems like most this record was building to that aspiration and then you have grow it very anywhere she's asking the question how can you get there where she's asking it seems like very much where this album was trying to was imply you're smarter than you let on that is one on the title track she's implies that you have more knowledge you just need to unpack it within your own mind and yet it seems at the very end of the album she has not figured it out for herself which I think it's an interesting contradiction that you can see brought forward where she struggles with her own vices where she struggles with her own being able to see had higher form of transcendence that's why the Invisible Man was probably my second favorite song this guy that had that better more punchy drums to it had a great courage swell that build up with these sparse minimalistic flutters but it's also that she's asking a question if I could see through I could see this Invisible Man what would I see would it terrify me or if I'm seeing through it what does that mean is there really just no substance there and I think that there is I think that the comic there I think in terms of those whether that Invisible Man is the own creatures that are haunting her own personal psychoses whether or not she's giving them body by looking at them for instance or whether not she be giving whether or not it's better to have them unseen or seen for instance I think that's maybe one other thing is that there that the record the more I listened to it the morrow is just kind of I don't know put off by it a little bit it seemed like kind of like the idea of eastern New Age thought sort of you know put through this kind of Western lens you know somebody who grew up in the West and grew up in you know kind of like a just a more I guess you were just saying more Western environment and you know trying to kind of chase that dragon of transcendence and and and maybe kind of going about it in a really obvious way not only with tracks like your creator but also you know the one yeah track you know III think was trying to I think was trying to embody the idea of like this meditative spirit but only it but only ended up kind of creating like a bit of a UH I guess just a really weak pastiche of it I think that Onias easily one of the weakest songs on the album it just it doesn't flow well she as she simply she was trying to go for that transcendent moment but especially during that interlude which she had that wow sound effect it just it felt really clumsy did not particularly work that well but this is a noun that I think even though it's it's striving to try to find that transcendence and it's not really getting in there and it doesn't have that looseness that that more organic feel to get there considering how stiff love these beats feel to me I'm I'd argue that sure she might be aware of it but still it doesn't redeem it I guess it's a little frustrating because you know while I think some of the the way the instrumentation locks it together into this record to create these grooves it could be a little bit more tense it could create this sense of progression a little bit better so that as you're moving through the song you feel like you're kind of going from point A to B but still on top of this instrumentation there are some wonderful moments sometimes her vocal layering is really great and really sharp sometimes her lyrics are great sometimes like on the song Invisible Man that keyboard solo on that track is really fantastic really playful really cool but again I don't get caught up in sort of the drums and the bass and the guitar is kind of playing in this rhythmic fashion together like like I would want to and I would agree with you there I think that a lot of it is trying to go for more of that drum circle feel but doesn't have the organic vibe and the organic fire that would come with one of these drum circle feels although this album feels very cold to me it doesn't have that it doesn't have that same sort of warmth that you would expect out of some of the guitars it doesn't even have that you know music exactly if he was communal music trying to be created through the mind of one person yes uh-huh and I would agree with you there I think that a lot of the I think that they have moments where she's trying to incorporate that communal feel by bringing in the multitrack vocals which are very pretty and it sound very very good but at the same time when it sounds so stiff on the lower end or you don't have any baseline with any sort of texture to it I don't have it's hard for me to go back to this in the same way especially when the songwriting is pretty lightweight yeah alright I think we can leave it there overall I mean I like this record for its experimentation its indulgence I think it's got a lot of pretty sounds on it and I like that it's you know a little bit out there but I think it just doesn't deliver on just all the promise that you know you would get from a singer that's good from you know the sort of instrumentals that are trying to you know ride the fringe a little bit like this and and with a record that has you know a handful of really solid songs that kind of built up through the release on Fiona I think of light to bees and six on this one I think I liked it a little bit more in terms of being able to get sucked into the vibe of some of these songs I think that a lot of them do come together more often than they don't I like some of the more frenetic krautrock inspired ones like the eye or the Invisible Man and I think there are fragments of idea that you that Jared Orion brings to the table that I'd love to see develop more but the problem is we don't get that additional development and thus I'm thinking probably a light 7 for me and even that feels a little generous all right Marc thanks for coming out and talking with me about this record I won I will leave a link to Marc's channel down in the description box so you guys can check out his reviews and check out his channel as well and I mean he's probably gonna be on this channel again someday talking to me about some other alright well thanks for having me on Anthony I really appreciate this all right have a good one dude alright later anthe Fantana spectrum pulse you know their door in forever 
GMdCY1Lf_aI,hi everyone pleasant than a nice tan oh dear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a little bit of a rundown of the music that I was listening to this past month and sort of what stuck out to me what I loved what I thought was great this past month great albums August let's go go go go this first album I want to recommend to you that you might have missed is the new destroyer album poison season destroy your AKA singer-songwriter dan Behar comes through with a wonderful piece of rock poetry on this record with some really lavish wonderful instrumentation really no complaints about this album dan Behar comes through and proves he can still do what he does best and it's a really good follow-up to his last full-length LP caput and a bit more of a revisit to you know just kind of as straight rock poetry days again with just some really big instrumentation strings horns really wonderful pianos and they're similarly hard rockin tunes on here as well as some very sedate lullaby ish stuff it all sounds like Dan Behar's own personal musical it's very well assembled very poetic and wonderful next the new ghost record meliora ghost is a fantastic metal band and in a rock band who came through the record here that I wish was actually their sophomore full-length record I feel like they kind of floundered a little bit had a little bit of a sophomore slump but they came through with a large album this time around with some great instrumentation felt like a metal record progressive rock record as well as a like a bit of an acoustic rock record on one single track it's a lot of things all rolled into one it's just so well orchestrated so well assembled and the songs are so catchy and the instrumentation sounds vibrant and sounds beautiful it sounds illustrious the lyrics are still kind of devilish on a lot of these tracks I think it's actually pretty ironic how blasphemous ghost is much of the time but there's a lot of music here that sounds uh almost as if it's been recorded in a Cathedral or it's like Cathedral ish it might even have a bit of a Christian rock vibe times especially on the song he is but but again I think that's ghost kind of playing with the idea of religious music and metal and in rock music in a really creative way on this record and one song just kind of seamlessly flows into the next very well assembled album as far as the the larger picture here it's it's definitely going to be one of my favorite albums of this year maybe my favorite rock record of the year we'll see but yeah ghost meliora fantastic next the new fka twigs EP the melissa EP fka twigs continues on this EP to prove that she is one of the most interesting art pop artists out there right now with creative instrumentals and a handful of great tunes just all around good EP very abstract very strange but also beautiful too next I want to sort of advocate for the new cattle decapitation record a good death grind a good Gore grind album the Anthropocene extinction this is not going to be for everybody if you're into extreme metal or if you just want to give an extreme metal album a try because you're morbidly curious then give this thing a listen the drumming may be a little rigid and kind of mechanical there's a lot of triggers here it's a very digital recording it's very heavily edited recording but the compositions are very sound the vocals are fantastic this band touts one of the best vocalists in extreme metal right now and despite each song being so extreme I I think each track kind of stands out with its own melodic personality and the performances are really good I mean the whirl winds of very quickly played guitars and drums on this thing really just to give me whipped up and then they sort of you know let off into these more melodic passages that contrasts really nicely with these very extreme moments the record across from front to back can be a little Sammy Sammy but I still thought it was a great record definitely one of the more standout metal records of the year the new Chelsea Wolfe album abyss if you're looking for a moody industrial goth rock album with some kind of doom metal notes and a few acoustic cuts here and there give this thing a listen I mean definitely going to this record expecting a sonic representation of an abyss this is a heavy oppressive record that will just swallow you whole if you allow it to and I actually had a very nice interview with Chelsea wolf not too long ago as well and it was it was really interesting sort of hearing about not only you know her I guess voluntary isolation when kind of creating this record but sort of how her issues with sleep paralysis kind of influenced and inspired a lot of what you'll hear on this album if you give it a try it's a very dark dark record and finally the new Lianne La Havas album blood lianne la havas really great singer-songwriter and pop artist from the UK comes through with a pretty mature record this time around for her sophomore release I think as a result of her not doing a more kind of bubblegum pop ish record maybe this album didn't turn as many heads as her debut did but I still think it's a pretty wonderful album I actually like it a little bit more than her debut there are some incredible instances of a very pretty jazz-influenced pop music on here some soul on here and the instrumentation on this record is a little more grand a little more ambitious and it just makes for a wonderful album a few instrumentals that feel like a bit of a throwback it's a solid record Lianne La Havas I had faith that Sheila continued to come through with some good pop music as long as people come through and listened to this album and support this record I'm just hoping that maybe this album picks up a little bit more in terms of steam before the year ends out and that this album ends up on a few year endless because it is a good pop record and those are essentially my favorite albums from this past month I hope you give a try to any of them that you haven't heard already and down in the comments let me know what your favorite albums from this past month had been and that's it you're the best Anthony Fantan oh great albums August forever 
rytCkGaV0bM,hi everyone nice to meet Ana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and in this video I'm going to be talking about Tyler the creators recent ban in the UK he's not allowed in the country he's not allowed to perform there actually had to cancel a few dates over there due to this three to five year ban and this ban occurs under the Conservative government that is currently in office in the UK right now although I'm not really sure if the call the original call to ban Tyler came from the conservative side of the aisle not really sure although last month there were some activist groups in Australia actually trying to ban Tyler from the country there - they didn't want him performing over there they didn't want him entering the country uh pretty interesting well more funny than interesting because the UK and Australia weren't trying to ban Tyler bakwin odd future were first blowing up and these offensive songs were in Tyler's live song rotation actually sum of odd futures first big initial shows after they got internet buzz were in the UK and I am NOT a Tyler the Creator fan I wouldn't call myself a fan of his music I have been pretty critical of many of his releases and I I do acknowledge that for a long time he has played it very fast and loose with his lyrics with his social media account and music websites as well as venues around the country we're happy to pimp him out and give him a place to perform back when he was like this blog darling and bringing everyone tons of buzz and tons of traffic but now that he's not as relevant as he used to be and that sort of invincibility that Armour that he once had against the media is gone he's kind of seeing this delayed backlash against all of the stuff all of his shenanigans that he's been involved in over the past several years you know and I know that Tyler's is far from a well-behaved musician which i think is part of why he's such an easy target for this ban still regardless the people advocating for Tyler the creators bands from whatever country or whatever place our prudish pieces of garbage with no historical perspective and no real appreciation for free speech they might talk a good game on the free speech side of things but once something offends them they'll start whipping out terminology like oh you know our values or this or you know his values are that and these sorts of values are reflected in his music or his music is harmful in some kind of way or it's really toxic avoid people that talk like this don't listen to people that talk like this because they're liars and they have an agenda and they're just trying to push it on you and they're just trying to moralize taste and moralize art this has happened many times before in the past with rap lyrics and metal albums and metal lyrics Dead Kennedys with the Frank and Christ trial look into that that's a really interesting trial Judas Priest got taken to trial it's happened with video games - again and again and again and the moralistic crybabies they're going to act like their opinions come from a place of concern and that they don't want to ban or change or censor anything but the moment these people are in power that's exactly what happens lyrics are censored or reversed or move from records album covers are changed parental advisory emblems get tossed on the cover art and artists aren't allowed to perform in certain places and that's exactly why you can't let these assholes spit they're venomous anti-free speech rhetoric and and play like the thing that you're listening to the thing that you enjoy is dangerous in some kind of way because it's not that's a lie that's bullshit the burden of proof is on these people to prove that this art that this expression is dangerous or harmful in some kind of way we need actual real undeniable statistic correlations and causations not just like some bullshit confirmation biased social science study no that's not proof I'm sorry how about some real proof and some real science and also keep in mind the people who are advocating for the censorship for the banning of certain things certain expressions whatever what's offensive is completely subjective and if you put mechanisms in place and if you set a precedent we're banning offensive anything is okay don't be surprised if five ten fifteen twenty years down the road someone in power finds what you're saying to be offensive and then what you advocated for he comes around to bite you in the ass and shuts you the fuck up no one's right to free speech should end where your feelings begin fuck your feelings and let's also you know mention that the people who are advocating for Tyler to be banned are probably racist dumbasses as well these people would never ban Eminem they would never ban cave because these people are old and they're white and because they're white they're given the benefit of the doubt that what they're saying in their songs the horrible horrific graphic thing is far more graphic than Tyler's ever done in a song or are done in jest or they're playing a character when they say these songs or that you know they may be making this music but it's not actually a reflection of their real values because Tyler is obnoxious he's young he's mouthy and he's black he's not given that same benefit of the doubt oh oh oh when I was younger I was just so sick of hearing people sort of spit this kind of rhetoric from the conservative right and I was so excited to get older because I was convinced that these people would eventually like I'll die and this mindset would go away but it's still here but the thing is now it's coming from both sides of the ideological aisle and it's ridiculous art is not harmful fucking rap lyrics are not harmful I may have my opinions on Tyler's music and other forms of music too I may like and dislike certain things and I may boldly express that in my reviews but I would never advocate for something to be censored something to be banned for an artist to be kicked out of a certain place or country where that person may fans I think that kind of shit is draconian and you shouldn't put up with that shit either don't listen to anybody don't take anybody seriously who toes that line and if Utah that kind of line and you watch my videos fuck off unsubscribe eat a dick so that's it you know that's all I really want to say have a good day forever 
ERDnCulXJB8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Macklemore and Ryan Lewis single downtown McLemore is a Seattle rapper in Ryan Lewis incredibly talented producer who have been just ruling the charts over the past few years with some fantastic tracks off of their debut full-length collaborative album The Heist I liked this album before it blew up and before it was actually cool to hate it and I actually enjoyed the the single wings as well as the wings EP it came from and the wings music video was actually my video of the year since it came out and um I don't really talked too much about Macklemore since my original review of the heist and the sort of rise to fame the meteoric rise to fame that he's had since then on this surprising somewhat independent come up and McLemore while I still appreciate his talents as an artist which I mean I can I can hear people now seeing blue Macklemore is not talented I hear it I hear the typing I hear it I appreciate his talents as an artist but I I too will agree his rise to fame has not exactly been pretty from everything with little Kendrick debacle and being like God I don't deserve this award honestly like while I wish Kendrick won as well the Grammys aren't good judges of niche sort of genres where the people who are truly passionate within that genre aren't necessarily reflecting the tastes of the lowest common denominator of the populace the Grammys judge pop music so if they're going to give your rap record a Grammy it's going to because it has pop appeal even going back 20 years if you look back 20 years here we could see the 1995 Grammys some of the winners of of Grammys that year and then this is cute this is funny let's see we had Sheryl Crow all I want to do that was a hit that was a lovely song everybody everywhere bruce springsteen streets of philadelphia best new artist was actually Sheryl Crow best alternative music performance was Green Day's Dookie as far as the rap of words that they did salt and pepper and Queen Latifah walked away with awards and actually you know they were good artists in their own right and they had great hits that you know are definitely significant in the history of hip-hop but when we actually look at the records that have received widespread critical acclaim during the year 1995 and have sort of you know withstood the test of time we have Radiohead's the bends came out in 1995 jizzes liquid freaking swords Bjork had a record Smashing Pumpkins had a record death had a record and I believe the best metal and hard rock performance with the Grammys in 1995 was freaking Soundgarden mob deep the infamous pulp different class chef Raekwon only built 4 Cuban Linx dropped that year PJ Harvey she actually got an MTV nod did not get a grammy nod though of pavements wowie-zowie Elliott Smiths Elliott Smith and honestly that's just the tip of the freaking iceberg Oasis what's the story Morning Glory came out goodie mob's sniffing wesson I'm just going to keep going down this thing and I'm just going to keep saying more and more great records of Fugazi red medicine don't really expect me to win a Grammy but you know that's still a fantastic record from 1995 slow dive and and it just goes on and on and on there were lots of great records superior to the Grammy winning records in 1995 as far as artistic quality but the thing is those records didn't have as much pop appeal and that's consistently how the Grammys judge whether or not someone's going to win a Grammy and that time around no Kendrick Lamar did not have as much pop appeal as McLemore more more so having said that macklemore's response to this whole situation wasn't really pretty we also had that incident where he was dressed in a questionable costume which a lot of people alleged to have racist undertones to it where he looked like an absolute freakin dope again it hasn't been pretty however that doesn't necessarily take away from macklemore's talents as a rapper and as what right now is kind of like a pop artist he is a pop artist who raps and also makes hip-hop music and I think on this new single over here and he had one not too long ago with Ed Sheeran that um I kind of let slip through the cracks a little bit because I wasn't really ready to jump into a song with Ed Sheeran on it not the biggest ed Sheeran fan and was kind of worried about what direction Macklemore would be taking with that song however it did in fact end up being this really heartfelt song to his child that um was pretty cute yeah Macklemore can be a little overly sentimental sometimes but at least when I'm listening to him I feel like what he's saying comes from a place of real feeling and concern and and that's um that's important to me you know it doesn't feel like a put-on even if at times it does feel like okay man Cheeta calculus and jaywalk but make sure you look both ways before you do boo boo boo and go to festivals okay buddy okay really great life advice I'm just gonna video living by this life advice regardless though this new single downtown which actually uh surprisingly featured not only the singer of Foxy Shazam but some pretty fantastic classic MCS to in this new video and even in the recording of the song I believe you can catch Eric Nally Grandmaster Caz also kool Moe Dee and Mele freaking Mel and there are so many rappers today that don't even know who the hell these people are which is unfortunate and I guess it's kind of cool that Macklemore is giving us a history lesson here let's take this track of two angles we have the musical side we have the lyrical side on the musical side of this record I think this is one of macklemore's better songs the production is fantastic so amen to Ryan Lewis on that the bassline is incredibly funky the groove is top-notch and surprisingly uh once that foxy Shazam sort of chorus comes popping in and you get that really huge rush of pianos and that really strong Queen influence coming through on the vocals that big glam rock delivery it's actually really good I'm usually pretty weary when it comes to hip-hop songs that include such showy melodic glamorous choruses but here it felt really beautiful and natural and I think that has a lot to do with Ryan Lewis's emphasis on organic large orchestral sized instrumentation in a lot of macklemore's instrumentals so when he does a course like this aesthetically it kind of fits into his style now the pianos here the strings it all sounds freakin gorgeous and I love the way the vocals layer on this chorus to downtown it's just so freakin feel-good man and I love how you get that bit of silence right after the first chorus and that bass line pops back in and you're just looped right back around into this amazing instrumental so again instrumentally I think this is a great track I don't really have too much to complain about on the instrumental side of things as far as the lyrics on this record go it's okay i I think Macklemore tried to recreate especially with the music video here that same winning formula that he had on thrift shop but instead of coming through with like a clear concise concept or message or really anything he kind of jumped around from random idea to random idea and sort of came through the music video that I think sort of through as many detours at us as the lyrics did I the thing about thrift shop though is that it focused on a concept and it's stuck with it and it was funny throughout and here while this track does have a pretty sharp sense of humor I think it loses sight of what it was originally trying to say at the start with the whole moped thing but then by the time the second chorus is here we've really kind of completely lost sight of the whole moped thing really by the time that the chorus pops in and all of a sudden we have this awesome very expensive-looking chariot riding in on motorcycles why not mopeds I don't know I guess there was a little bit of a gang versus gang kind of thing and a sort of sense going on in this video but they didn't really play with that dynamic so much that it that it played out in any kind of code hiren way by the end of the music video I kind of felt like the song and the video itself kind of started off with an interesting prospect for a story or some kind of portrait of something a moped rider a person a gang a town or whatever but then by the end of it it didn't really turn into anything more than just kind of like this really high budget looking parade and the second verse on here I think is really where the record flounders not only in terms of just the concept not being there but some of macklemore's corniest lines pop up on this second verse here when he's like there's layers to this Karen masu and also that whole line about the eagle like landing on his bike or whatever and then he's just like Hello his flow here on this portion of the song is just so soft voiced and weird it's like you know we we know that that you're not trying to be hard and we accept that you're not you know one of these hard rappers but but but at least bring a little bit of urgency to the table you know don't sound like and no matter what I rap here I'm gonna I'm gonna make money so let's let's just do it but but I guess it's it's not too much of a loss in that it's just kind of a funny jokey song I mean I don't think Macklemore has any presumptions of this track being really deep or anything like that and while some of his biggest singles in the past have been these really large meaningful songs thrift shop is a silly track you know so so I think Macklemore you know allots himself those opportunities here and there to do a silly song do a ridiculous song I like the fact that he's an artist who you know can come out with these tracks that at least to him feel really meaningful and are supposed to be really thought-provoking and are supposed to be really personal but he's also capable of doing a fun poppy you know kind of playful track like this um overall I don't think it's too bad of a tune I don't think it's probably going to skyrocket in the same way that thrift shop did if it were going to I think it had the instrumental I think it had the music video but I think it really kind of needed the concept in the same way that thrift shop had icons and while the moped thing at the start of the track was certainly silly I don't know I think you could probably sell America on the idea of a thrift shop song faster than you could probably a moped song and maybe that's why Macklemore didn't really follow through with it if he was going to do another first shop which again I do think this was an attempt at that he would most definitely have to come together with a better song idea than mopeds and just random lines about tara misu and all that regardless though I think that silliness that randomness all those lyrical detours do play into the old school vibe that this track puts forward on the instrumental here and another thing that's obviously a reference point for Macklemore and company on this track is the freakin Mark Ronson song uptown funk and while I think at first listen me and a lot of other people kind of assume that maybe this is kind of a ripoff some sort I think the similarities in the instrumental here and on Mark Ronson song along with the title of this track aren't so much a ripoff but kind of just like a blatant nod or reference or even like a response which is something that not a lot of pop stars do today and not that there was ever a point in which it was rampant but I kind of think back to moments like how the Beatles sergeant pepper's was like blatantly supposed to be a an answer kind of a an attempt to top what the Beach Boys were doing on Pet Sounds or kind of like Bob Dylan when he put out that song you got to serve somebody John Lennon put out that scathing track serve yourself and not that I think that a Macklemore is trying to you know beef with Mark Ronson or anything like that but I think he just kind of heard that old-school throwback style that he had going on uptown funk and he figured he was going to come out with his own throwback and he was going to have it be funky he was going to have it be filled with natural instrumentation organic instrumentation he was going to have a big vocal a great singer and a big hook on the track too and yeah this is just like kind of his version his take on this new wave of older funkier Morgan and Instrumentation popping up in a lot of pop music from bands like Higham to even new carly rae jepsen record a little bit so yeah I think Macklemore just kind of acknowledging this new trend in pop music not in hip-hop music in pop music because remember he is a pop artist pretty much at this point and he came out with a decent single am I like head over heels for do I think it's a greatest single of all time it has its flaws but I think it's a good single and I think this track along with the Ed Sheeran song that he just recently did are a show that we have two songs thus far probably an album on the way that aren't too bad and I mean again I understand a lot of people don't like Macklemore they think he's either corny or he's not hard enough for whatever he's not authentically hip-hop and that's fine I don't really sort of at this point anyway with this track I guess hold him to that same hip-hop rubric even though his songs do include elements of hip-hop music I just kind of see him as a pop artist at this point even though he is rapping on his songs which instantly would make most people think okay I'm listen to a hip-hop track I don't really see it as that I just kind of see his music as being pop music pop music that a lot of the time has a message behind it or is actually in very very good creative entertaining fun and that's more what I see this single as let me know what you think of this new track what do you think of downtown what do you think of these two new mclemore tracks where do you think he is headed with his new record do you even care do you just hate him do you think macklemore's total garbage and you would never enjoy a Macklemore song ever do keep in mind that he was taken relatively seriously before that whole heist record blew up I mean even Sub Pop came out with a 45 of that same love tune and your boys schoolboy q was on the heist let's not forget that regardless though it's it's it's whatever um I'm not so much defending Macklemore but kind of observing the the silliness and the fickleness of music listening audiences it's it's actually quite quite interesting quite interesting but you know just I'll just leave it at that

everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and you are listening to a brand new episode of the needle drop podcast thank you for being here and in this episode i have an interview with a very special guest a rapper a philosopher Hellfire Club member and unbeknownst to you up until this point Connecticut skee-ball champion that's that's you that's Milo how you doing dude you're always a winner in my eyes though no you were really fantastic at skeeball I was pretty pretty bad and somebody got stabbed at that show someone did get stabbed at that show sometimes people bring up in in rap songs or even in conversation how dangerous where they live is and and you and I were at maybe one of the most innocent rap shows to ever tour the country and yet someone got stabbed outside right um so you got to expand your definition of sensitive and soft and sweet because yeah absolutely and also just you know rethink rethink what you think of gun wave in New Haven oh is that the that's the punchline damn there's yeah there's there's a lot of good uh there's a lot of good Connecticut gun related you know phrases Lorna guns I don't own a gun if I lived in gonna wait in New Haven I might or if I lived over in Hartford which some people call hate furred and there's also a place called Bristol don't go through Bristol less you got a pistol you know there's there's a lot of good there's a lot of good phrases having to do with firearms and and Connecticut but but more about where you are I mean I haven't talked with you since you sort of relocated and you're living on the west coast now is that correct no man I live in Milwaukee Wisconsin you live in Milwaukee Wisconsin again I thought you were on the west coast for a while I was I was is this a plot device or are you real you really didn't know it no I really didn't know that dude I'm not I I'm not keeping track of your location should I be yeah I be making sure I know where you live okay good no I just I just wanted to know yeah man I left other I was there for I guess about six months okay so when I talked with you about that online it seemed like your reasoning for doing so was to sort of put yourself into a better creative headspace so that you can kind of also be shoulder to shoulder with these artists who you sort of looked up to and held in very high regard you know open mike eagle bus driver and just the whole Hellfire crew in general and and and now you're sort of back in Wisconsin which is you know obviously your home base what what sort of made that change you know back to back to where you were well I think what you said man I went to LA to try to be influenced by great artists and to learn from them and learn styles from them and you know just work habits and ethics it's not really obvious when you start rapping that it might become a job for you hmm and what it does you know there's not a manual that lets you know how to do it how to do it well and how to do it continuously so being able to know someone like Regan Farquhar bus driver who's like you know been a lifelong career rapper it just seemed important to go to LA and learn how to do that and I guess once I've felt comfortable with my knowledge I I left mm-hm now now I'm trying to execute what I learned in practice with my own label called Ruby yeah so you so you kind of approached it as more of like I'm going to school for sort of like a limited amount of time sort of thing as opposed to like turning this turning this into a lifestyle I guess I mean I don't really know any other way I guess to go about doing things I feel very comfortable it would that kind of a dynamic of going in in seeking I guess knowledge does a dumb thing to say out loud like that but yeah man we I went to LA to learn how to be a career rapper well I don't think that's necessarily a sort of the the idea of looking for knowledge like that I don't think that's necessarily a bad way to look at it I mean I think if I mean a change of setting is great but I think your music is really personal your music is really is is really you and it's really intimate and I kind of feel like while it was great and it's great that you go someplace to sort of learn ideas and learn skills and learn you know work ethic like you were saying from from other artists who have sort of been doing this longer than you simultaneously I feel like where you're from is sort of essential to who you are and if you were to change that permanently that would probably mean a permanent change for you as well yeah absolutely I feel like like nobody turns college into their whole life you go to school and then eventually you leave that school environment is is that kind of how you saw it like in order to continue doing what you were doing successfully and sort of continue to grow you had to sort of be in this area learn and then go away to be on your own to sort of you know I guess think of these ideas while you're solo well I think that I think it goes I don't know it might even be simpler than that it might just be like to qualify something as knowledge it has to be you know demonstrated it has to be communicated and that's how that's how you know you know and just like within the dynamic of Hellfire Club to men you have to know like I'm 10 years younger than the younger dude my ideas are coming from a place of like oh that's the you know kind of little homie and I don't mind that that's cool but I definitely want my own thing to be able to you know test out bizarre ideas and stuff like I wanted to do this rap scene called a brook so and we did that last month there's a lot of fun and you know ideas like that that really wouldn't fit in the context of a hellfire universe hmm and while back here back in Milwaukee there's a really strong DIY art scene here very very strong and so you know moving back buying tape dubbers getting into manufacturing all of my own products by hand I like that stuff man I like approaching this like a craft it's important to me to keep that going yeah I mean a lot to sorry I mean it's it's it's a lot to think about I mean do you think I was I was kind of having this conversation recently about them about scenes with someone and you know you were just talking about the art scene that you came from do you sort of prefer it to the LA scene I mean is there something about it that obviously attracted you to the point where you felt like you needed to go back and participate in it rather than sort of well you hang out in this I mean a lot of people are going to naturally see la is like a bigger pond you know la is like too many scenes la is a confluence of scenes on top of each other and especially regarding rap you have la underground you have la mainstream like then you have the the convergence of the two when Kendrick Lamar goes to bananas which is the event that verbs hosts and you're like whoa what the fuck is going on why are these worlds even on top of each other yeah and um those kind of things just like I don't know I didn't like how they were affecting my mind and my thoughts and like I was I rented this little tiny garage from a lady to make music in and I would see certain people in that neighborhood sometimes and I would be tripping off of it and then I would be like man why do I give a fuck and just you know I mean you start to buy into all that kind of stuff when you're surrounded by in LA while out here in Milwaukee I I would say the scene here is not focused so much on the Creator as it is on what is created and that's that seems like a better model to be working from you know like you want to be you want to be like yo this thing I made is dope not you know I'm dope and you should be paying attention to my every movement scenes really have just so many ups and downs to them you know not not to say that you made the wrong move I'm talking in reaction everything that you said about the the LA it's a little you know the the scenes can have a lot of attention on them which can definitely help out your career if you're a part of this I guess kind of music journalism blitz like oh everybody from this one immediate areas like really cool and really interesting all of a sudden you know when we just image and we just started paying attention to them for whatever reason but then simultaneously you know they're that some people float to the top of that and then all the people stuck at the bottom you know only have so much leeway and influence and I guess the the there's a bit of a glass ceiling there once the kind of stars have been established I guess until things kind of cooled down and then you sort of have this kendrick lamar come out of nowhere like just just when people thought there was really no reason to pay attention to that area anymore somebody just comes out of it and it's like oh wow that guy's that guy's really great but uh but on the flip side of that you know sort being in a small scene and I imagine that this probably isn't the case where you are I mean I don't think you would be there if it were but sometimes with a small scene people can be sort of a closed-minded to new ideas and only want to support you know certain sounds or certain artists I mean you know uh certain ideas can kind of be established within a particular local scene and then people just want to support that sound or support the artists that kind of give them that sound and avoid anyone else I don't know in my experience has been the inverse man which is why I returned in LA I would definitely say like rap and rap habits tend to be more motivated by you know whether or not it's a paid opportunity and that makes sense it costs more to live in LA you know I mean in Milwaukee the pace of life is slower it's cheaper to live here and so I'm doing a lot more experimenting in playing with people I would never normally play with just because I can there's nothing riding on it it's not a big deal you know and I kind of like that yeah but I think to what you were talking about earlier maybe like why Milwaukee scene vers la scene in LA something that I experienced which obviously anyone who listens to LA rap knows is just like everyone in La is so proud to be from LA and a rapper and you're like man I'm not from LA but I'm a rapper hmm and I don't know my mama just wander like shit I should return to Milwaukee I am good at what I do and I could be incubating things instead of just kind of a experiencing them here well I think that's I think that's the kind of mindset that you would expect from somebody who you know like you were saying earlier the youngest dude in the rap crew who is 10 years younger than the youngest dude and is the lil homie that dude who came up in and the the the the Internet age that you did isn't gonna see location as big as a big deal you know like you're gonna want to be where you're comfortable you know not where you think you can make it you know because in in your mind you can make the kind of music that you want to make anywhere and you don't need to be anywhere other than the Internet in order to give it to the people who want to hear it right yo the man I mean that's really true and a lot of that is like Big Ups to you know you thank you said and other individuals who when I was in in college literally in nowhere made you know made my rap career possible early on and so I think I've had that demonstrated to me those guys are from LA they've only ever you know orbited the LA scene and so there's just a huge importance on location for them but yeah I experienced a different thing so kind of just living out your days in Milwaukee is that kind of your plan or do you think you know and just like kind of quietly just working at your craft or do you think that you can kind of be in this you know small sleepy place but still have I guess kind of big musical ambitions yeah I have I have some ambitions man right now what I'm doing in Milwaukee is just building infrastructure and so here things are cheap I'm able to have a studio and an apartment you know stuff like that sure and when starting its label in like cultivating a roster and talking to artists who are all over the country and who are like my age and like kind of trying to convince some of them to move and wanting to build a community and then wanting to really just transmit a strong and clear aesthetic that is totally our own I mean I don't think there's a lot of rap being made like what I make and I don't even think what I make is that experimental I know lots of people who make weirder stuff hmm and so I just wanna I guess I want to explore that vein and hopefully be able to give a name to it and a home to some of those kind of artists with Ruby yot so so my goal is really to make Milwaukee a-- a rap destination ultimately I don't I don't think this town will be considered sleepy much longer even if it is much anymore I mean on the tour circuit it's a really dope spot yeah I think sleepy was uh was was the wrong word I mean you know it's it's a smaller city yeah you know it's it's not it's not seen as on larger scale as as as LA or whatever you know as far as the hip hop destination but but you seem to really kind of have a passion for that immediate area and you sort of want to you know put it on the map sort of you know in in in maybe not in the same way but sort of like in a like way to the whole straight out of Compton thing you know because up until up until the release of that record I mean the Compton wasn't known as this musical destination or a place that anybody super significant was from as far as music goes I think that what I would like to do those maybe even make a final point about geography though which is like if a doe please do if a dope alternative rap label can come out of Milwaukee at this time and really cement itself then I think it sort of was like who even cares where you're from anymore you know what I mean like that that being I guess the difference between our thing and NWA's thing because Compton is like they stake their entire claim on Compton's existence Wow I think when my situation its defying a location and therefore kind of dismissing location in general yeah I mean I think I mean there there are a lot of great labels out there that I follow pretty closely but they they don't so much specifically deal in hip hop that um yeah I don't know where the hell they're from honestly like I I don't know and and and the thing is I mean they may be from somewhere but they don't necessarily announce it right I have no idea where the hell software records is from I have no idea where triangle records is from I have no idea where where what's your rupture is from is Mexican summer from Mexico I don't know do probably not I don't know probably not probably no no probably not I used to find Polly my favorite Jade electronica songs style mm-hmm did you hear that my Kegel oh good good you know did you see uh did you see his rap god comment Jay Electronica talking about how he's the god of rap in response to sort of seeing Jay Cole and and and Drake or you know he was talking on during the performance about he's how he's the god of I mean if you're not talking about Regan Michael or David that I guess yeah like I would say Jay like Jonathan well I mean I'm not as my response to that personally it was like yeah he actually is the god of rap because we we never see him and we almost never hear him and you know we all we know of him are these old documents that we just Mull of or just again and again and again and again so I mean in that respect he very much is like you know the deity of uh of hip-hop dude there's I don't know something about Jay Electronica man like really only magically know there is which which is which is why he's so kept up so much all this attention for so long no doubt not not to sort of talk to you as if I'm an old man and you're someone who's super young because we don't really have that much of an age difference but I think what people in your generation and younger really start needed to really start to need to prove to people and this is happening little by little is that location just doesn't matter anymore you know we're not tethered to a scene we're not tethered to a location you can make great music anywhere you can promote great music from anywhere you know you don't need to be you you don't need to move to New York to make it which I mean when when when I was you know in college you know that there were musicians who I knew in my immediate area who were like we're getting the hell out of go to New York and we're gonna shake it which you know I at the time I thought was ridiculous but but that's actually the story of a lot of musicians from Connecticut I mean Thurston Moore's from Connecticut right they're actually quite a few popular musicians who made it you know either in the mainstream or in the underground who are from Connecticut but the thing is in the in the Internet age that's not how the the the model works anymore you know and it just kind of seems like you know unless you kind of had an opportunity like you did like they're already artists out there who fuck with your music and you know who you could gain insight from on a really close and personal level because they'll sort of allow you into their musical world and sort of you know watch them create and you know give you the ability to collaborate with them unless you're kind of allotted that opportunity I don't really see the point in just moving to someplace just to make the art you want to make you should be able to make the art you want to make anywhere you know especially in the digital age unless maybe you make unless maybe you make like organ music and there's like some kind of super awesome organ in like Norway or something in like an old church that only sounds a certain way and and and you you got it good yeah that too and you got to go out there you got to go out there to play that organ but you know other than that situation I I don't see why you got to move I mean I think that you should travel yeah oh no if you have to move oh yeah most definitely most definitely travel I mean you know nothing wrong with traveling I mean you know that you should you should make music gather some attention behind it and then as soon as the first opportunity comes to tour take it and have you internationally yet have I toured internationally I've been outside of the country doing what I do yeah that's really dope dude that's where did you go I went to I think I went I went to Barcelona earlier this year to do Primavera to do Primavera Sound I know it's crazy I'd never I never would have thought I would go to Barcelona ever in my life would you eat over there I don't know just like vegetarian stuff I mean you know it's it's kind of like a metropolitan city I mean most of everything you can get over here you can get over there how but that's not the stuff I would want but I see what you yeah I know but I'm vegan so I got to keep it vegan everywhere you know what I mean yeah man Regan's vegan touring with him is interesting he asked he like its subway everyday just salad brick well I was mostly uh I was mostly just taking in the architecture more than I was the food in the downtown area it's a lot of Gothic architecture down that was pretty freakin awesome frozen music yes sure yes exactly that's exactly what it is frozen it's frozen music that's a beautiful way of looking at it I didn't I didn't invent I'd say but I can't remember who did that's take take credit for whatever you you you stole and don't remember its origins okay and and then once once the person who actually did make it up and is angry with you comes comes knocking on your door you like that's where that came from you know cool dude thanks for the reminder oops all right so does even even though uh tell me how recently did you move back to Milwaukee how recent was that was that moving Milwaukee in February okay so that's that's not too long ago so you well you were over there in LA you made quite a bit of music out there um I made music you made a lot of music out there and you released quite a bit of it too did you make that whole scallops hotel a sort of album the plain speaking record did you make that out there entirely or did you make that some of that in Milwaukee I made all of that well no shit I didn't make all of it I made 85% of it in Milwaukee okay okay I made the first song in LA that was like the first song was made in LA and then I think we moved like three days later you made this record 85% of this record once you moved back to home base in Milwaukee uh you know what what did your creative process turn into you know in in this more familiar place as opposed to when you're in LA sort of in this quieter setting where you're by yourself and you're not sort of distracted by the fact that you're in this larger area and that you're with these other artists who at one point you know for sure you idolized but I mean I'm sure the the longer you stayed over there then where you just kind of got to know them as people and just kind of on a personal level you know what once you were in this quieter space what did your creative process turn into were you able to focus better did you feel happier with the end result of what you made yeah man I mean I think in LA you know that that phrase proximity kills your heroes I don't know it's almost kind of important to go through that I think to really start making good stuff and yet man by the time I got back to Milwaukee I was able to make things entirely alone for the first time in my music making career from the beginning to the end like I can make the beat I could obviously write the rap so I can record myself mix it master be totally done dub it to tape like that kind of agency really just motivated the making of plain speaking I mean the whole thing probably took two three weeks to make is just you know yeah you didn't know how to do a lot of that stuff back when I first reviewed you right exactly exactly and I mean that was something that I could have abandoned I mean obviously my early tapes are pretty janky sounding but it's something that I just really impassionate about learning more about and I and I'm not I'm not even professional quality I don't think on any of the things that I do but I I don't know I'm trying to get better every day and I like I don't know I feel motivated by these sort of technical things that you have to that you have to or you don't have to but should learn about making music just I don't know it motivates me but in LA the process was way different and it's cool I finished this album with um Kenny Segal a Mylo album that'll actually be coming out pretty soon um in working with him in like a and like professional studios and like really nice mics and I wouldn't have to touch any knobs or anything you just go in there and wrap the thing once and everyone's like so stoked that you did it once and yeah that's a way different feeling than being in like a weird-ass old factory recording myself by the space heater trying to like put a high-pass filter so you don't hear the ink going on so the the problems around you are sort of guiding the mixing process yeah but they're guiding the content too man why sure I guess I'm I'm all over the place man I apologize but I I guess I'm trying to illustrate by these two examples is just like how how matters of place affect the process in like why scallops Hotel is you know more it sounds like it was made in the creaking old wooden place because it genuinely was made in a creaking old wooden place and so you're not you know you're you're the the the other setting I mean it was great to learn there but it was a little too sanitary you're not like Drake you're not in the studio one take you're on the iPhone you know rereading your lyrics right off the iPhone yeah I've done that stuff and it's cool but it's like not what I want to do all the time and it's definitely not what I find to be fulfilling or you know it's just not that dope but I've done that yeah I've been Drake off the iPhone it sounds like you know you just get more out of food like there's so many weird things that happen when you're a musician that nobody will ever know about like we went Mike one time Mike Reagan and I went to Dave Grohl studio to record with Jill Scott and I did diverse off the iPhone like what you're talking about and huh we're all like what the fuck are we doing here am i this song that song probably has already deleted three times over who you note I mean what's that supposed to be on her was that supposed to be on her new record you're supposed to be on anything I don't even until I was even there man but that's the kind of stuff that you find yourself doing in beautiful Studios in LA yeah what what was I doing that for I could have been in my bedroom throwing down five different songs on an album I could you know put on Bandcamp next weekend so you're like you know essentially in the room Jill Scott's there Dave Grohl studio and you're just like man I wish I was on Bandcamp right now I wish oh there's no home recording my own stuff it's like it's just like you know at that level of musicianship and that many people involved it's just like yo I'm like this isn't me like I don't even you have employees your creation process involves yeah just blows my mind yeah it's not it's not for me certain although I don't look like I'm that meme guy no probably not but I mean you're you're saying some people thrive in that environment and some people it's it seems like to me you kind of want to be like this I don't know this jack of all musical trades when it comes to every single step of the recording process of your music sort of sort of stepping into studio and be like yeah man got the verse and then just passing it off to some dude to produce it and then pass something off to another dude to mix it and master it or whatever and then passing it off to another dude to sort of put it onto a tape that just kind of seems inauthentic or something it doesn't even seem inauthentic it just for me it's how I've been able to make money and live and and so I've become passionate about my craft it has nothing to do with me feeling like anyone else is doing something inauthentic I just coming up in a different music business time you know I have to I have to figure out how to make a living by selling my music and obviously digitally is not the way that that happens often yeah and so I found is if I go through and I make sure that on every level of this thing that I'm making I had involvement if not total involvement then I am giving this thing that I'm making worth right I'm saying this is worth my time in all these different ways hmm and I put that time up and I don't know it's it's been an interesting thing when I have to obviously sell them my art and that's why I do it man I don't know it I don't it's not a matter of authenticity I just yeah authenticity none of the wrong but i but harping on that I just I've had this conversation a few times sometimes it shows or with other musicians and there's you know obviously the way that I have written my music and write my music there seems to be this idea that maybe I think I'm like the most authentic man like I'm really out here dog and I'm just I do this shit because that's how I've been able to eat and it's for no other reason than that and and now I'm passionate about it and I want to do it because I don't see anyone else doing it but I don't know that's it well good okay going off of that just just one thing to sort of clarify what I was saying not only just to you know sort of get a definite answer out of you on this it seems like the more you involve yourself in the process the more you can put what you feel is like your personal spin into every aspect of the music which makes it more personal for you because the music in the past that I know that you've made where other people have been producing and and maybe other parts of the the creative process to have been passed off to other people that music sounded very different to me than what you were just doing on you know scallops Hotel in terms of just the aesthetic of it and you know do you feel like you're in in sort of involving yourself in more steps of that process do you feel like you are sort of giving people a more personal product giving people more you in the music thank you for asking such a great question I mean that's like a question I feel like well I and it's not even so much a question as much as it is it just kind of seems like that's what you were getting at you know by saying like yeah I want I want to be able to scallops Hotel shit is a way for me to make my own beats under lower stakes operation and then be able to import that knowledge into the Milo operation so and I'm in a room of the studio I can communicate my ideas fluidly if not just demonstrate you know and so the music is able to become way more personal because yeah for once I'm able to really have a hand in in the architecture and the structures and that stuff really opens me up lyrically and I mean especially earlier on with like you know weird flow flow problems and rhythm problems and stuff like that and and being attracted to a certain type of beat but not being able to change it or morph it or make my own version of it to accommodate what I needed to say okay well to go off the second thing that you were saying earlier and and I think this is something that sound that that that people of your generation and younger also need to work against and and and maybe working against kind of just just by fact that you're like this is what I got to do you know this is just like the fact of life you know it just kind of seems like people my age and older are still stuck on this idea of like you know the moment art starts making money it's inauthentic or you've sold out in some kind of way or it's just like you know a totally uncool whereas you you know you sort of seem to be the talking about the fact that you've been making a living off of this and this really just kind of Frank and open way and and I mean it's not it's not an in and not in like you know sort of a typical hip-hop braggadocious kind of way just is like you know this is how I eat brew yo man we have to demystify it that's something that Milo Gees taught me you know like bus that's his huge thing we have to defy it like this is just a job man like a really dope one one that I'm passionate about and was groomed to be good at but at the end of the day this is how I earn a living and so to talk about it any other way is to do it a disservice you know and especially when you start talking about it in these weird clouded ways I just don't even understand why I guess if if you were very wealthy that would be why but the majority of rappers I know aren't and they kind of try to hide that maybe or not talk about it as an occupation which i think is part of the reason why especially independent rap is the way that it is today because constantly you you have the people doing it telling you not to do it that it isn't lucrative that it is a loser career that it you know I mean it's like why are you doing that sure I wonder why I'm 10 years younger than the youngest homie and the crew it's like you didn't water the fields yeah oh that that's actually really interesting observation I don't know that's that was tangential but like I don't know it is a job and it's one that I love and especially trying to get you know my friends involved who are musicians and in pursuing this as as their careers it's it's definitely become useful to speak about it in these open terms so I guess the other I I think it's it's I I think the reason we kind of have people sort of with that bitterness is because like you were talking about people sort of talk about this career and this sort of life in very mystical terms and in very sort of inflated terms so as a result I mean you know you you have music fans that are either sort of angry and sort of jealous over the fact that all you do is like say words into a microphone and you make money and then they're pissed about that and so as a result of that jealousy they hate you and they hate anybody else who they can kind of compare to you sort of doing the same thing that you're doing but on the flip side of that there are also other people who yeah and and and those people even though they hate you they're still buying into this mystery you know even though they think that even though they think that they're being real by sort of rejecting the idea of of yeah that person's famous fuck that guy they're not being real because they're still even though they're angry and they're rejecting it they still believe that that that lifestyle and that you know that that lavish idea of what it's like to be a musician or a rock star or a rapper or whatever is is like a real thing and then on the other side you have people who accept the mystery as real but they buy into it and they love it right and and they they use that belief that you're this famous rapper that you know someone so is this famous rapper to sort of build up their opinion of that person like oh my god I can't believe amazing this person is there they're famous and they're rich and you know they're they're having sex with this person and that person and the their their their lyrics that somebody else might have ghostwritten for them is on as on a sprite can I love that person I love that person I love that person I am in love with anyway sorry my person that idea and that sort of you know that mystery and that idea of like you know musicians sort of all living this really lavish awesome crazy lifestyle where they're just you know being given party drugs and having sex with groupies like left and right I feel like building that up helps some musicians but it helps the musicians who would but but it hurts the musicians who are just starting out and the people who are sort of on the lower rung need to deal with the bullshit they can't throw at them because then everyone else conflates the mystical bullshit that you hear about musicians with like they treat that as if it were a rubric with which to judge musicians and their success and so then it's like what is even happening here right like I'll tell someone I'm a rapper and they'll be like oh that's weird like da da da da and then they'll just assume that I'm hell broke cuz i'm an india rapture and this like that is a common thing and it's like why do you think that oh because you're not exuding Xyz characteristic or whatever and mmm I don't know that's really the problem when people take you know sprite can rappers bullshit propaganda mysticism you know PR campaign as the rubric with which to judge the next bus driver album that's pretty wack sprite can rappers that is a genre now oh I know and even that is very interesting like Vince staples is so clever right in like his the way he's been promoting sprite in particular has been so interesting with its decidedly postmodern and tongue-in-cheek vibe yeah I mean there's there's a lot of very sort of very artsy sort of I guess music endorsement ad campaigns going on right now not only with that whole sprite thing but with the whole like Kendrick Lamar rubra Reebok like shoe deal and I just went down about like the the the the blood who critic read and you know sort of shoe concept which is just like Moses of three bucks I know lately I've been thinking about how rap stopped urging its listeners to express themselves without making purchases hmm it's kind of bums me out like I don't know man when I was a sophomore in high schools like the peak of the mixtape era and culture and I just love that time in my first release the mixtape you know like I I don't know I miss actually you you feel like the mixtape culture is kind of dead right now or or it's just so saturated that it doesn't mean anything for rap it's at a point where it's considered less than artistic and I just find that like a lot of people who listen to rap they're they're not given opportunities to express themselves outside of just making purchases I think a lot of people are just kind of tuned out to that whole mixtape thing because it's because of just technology and everything it's it's so easy for someone to make a mixtape and and not to say that you know like what you were doing early on was really easy I think simultaneously what people expect quality level when you say mixtape has like fallen dramatically yeah yeah it's it's like it's easy to make a mixtape it's it's easy to make a crappy mixtape but still call it a mixtape and just be like hey do check out my mixtape and that's not even something that I personally experienced as somebody who reviews music I mean you know the idea of somebody you know throwing their mixtape your way and trying to get you to listen to their mixtape is actually a pretty widely acknowledged meme on the internet because you know pretty much anywhere that you go where people can comment freely on a forum or in the comments section of something somebody's like hey man I'm broke will you listen to my mixtape so you're are you are you saying that like that that things were a little more fresh when they were free or I mean the what what is the preferred way in which you would like to be seeing rap fans sort of express themselves without making you know a purchase because at least in my experience that they're doing that all the time with with social media and with angry comments and we write you know personal endorsements I guess I don't I don't think of that as like a creative endeavor like angry content I don't know man I don't pretend to have all the answers I just I feel weird right now when I look at rap and I look at just how much of it is being used to sell shit that's all it's not a new story yeah yeah no I hear you so so so I think it's it seems like acknowledging the fact that you make money off of this and you make a living off of this is is one thing was sort of co-opting it in such a way where it becomes of like semi an advertisement is kind of where the line is drawn for you that's definitely the line this job for me yeah I guess I guess I'd feel uncomfortable with that in my in my own life so so moving on to a you know just kind of what people can expect from you in the in the near future I mean now that you're back in Milwaukee with this past scallops hotel project you're obviously you know making quit have quite a bit of music out there and you said that you have a Milo project on the way you know when when can people expect the new Milo album and now that you've you know sort of displayed to us kind of the the function of the scallops hotel project you know what what did you learn or do during plain speaking that you're going to apply and kind of a bigger and better and more significant way on your next Milo album I think maybe maybe the most prominent aspect of the next Milo record is it's not very shy you know it's not it's not painfully self-aware I'm not paying fully self-aware anymore I'm able to say what I want to say without without rationalizing it without qualifying it or without even really feeling the need to contextualize it that thoroughly so I think that would be confusing to a lot of people it's louder man but it's it's definitely like the next model record is the one that I feel I mean I said it's every time but shit man I don't know it feels really good feels dope it feels like a breakthrough in the sense of it has all the components of each album has been a lesson and it has all the components of those lessons but it also is just this breakthrough moment in a lot of ways like with this one I've been saying I wish this could have been the first thing I ever made because he really feels like the first thing like ah yeah yeah it's different why I think I think that's a great feeling and a feeling that any artist should actually strive for on each new release I mean even though in in retrospect you might look at your old stuff and just kind of be like you know man I did that or you know that's all right but I feel like I'm doing a B and C better now you know even though you might look at that that older stuff and and and feel that way I it's it's still good to acknowledge that at that moment when you released it you were like yeah you know I feel like I've actually improved this time and and you know I think the moment I I don't think you know you should you should consider releasing something until you kind of find that moment until you find that feeling like okay I'm at a point where I personally feel like I've I've I've matured in some kind of way or I'm doing something oh you know really different or fulfilling or something yeah I would love for that to but I am not willing to compromise and I want to be a rapper for a living and so there are times you put out an album when you gotta eat but yeah with this one everything worked out in that sense of timing in that really I mean ah and it comes out late September and okay yeah I mean it's it's it's called so the Flies don't come Kenny seagull made the beats and I wrote the raps it's dope okay can you see galan the beats you're on the raps so the flies don't come it's coming this September now that you've kind of been solo for a while and you've established yourself as the solo artist who lives off of what they do you know the moment you started working in this hole scallops hotel realm you know like what were you thinking and kind of where was your mind when you were on the border of sort of doing you know I'm doing a side project you know I can't believe it like you know what puts you in that position or kind of not you know how exactly do you communicate to the people who love you for this one thing and even though they love you you know that there are people who you know who listen to what you do who are gonna try to pigeonhole you you know and and are like you know obviously you know you're probably thinking I know a guy like that who wears that shoes and is a total fucking dickhead who's talking to me right now but you know obviously you're not going to make everybody happy with every release and every single time you try to do something different you know sort of it sounds like you know you're in a position though where you're the where you know your lack of self-awareness I guess you know you kind of you kind of benefit from that you know because the more people who start following you and listening to you the more opinions are any thrown your way I guess yeah I mean I feel fortunate to have a working relationship with you Anthony because yeah it has been interesting for me and especially kind of in a in a weird public way to be like oh man this guy is cool you know and like oh you can't put me on and then be like oh he didn't like that one oh he liked that I didn't like or whatever and just having to like learn how to take criticism to a degree and learn also when to just ignore it you know entirely and I sure and I feel like when I moved to LA and then toothpaste suburb came out that was really the pinnacle of me learning to ignore shit entirely because I mean there were things going weird with Hellfire there were things going weird with the records reception and I was on tour writing a lot of music and just learning how to mute all of that shit out and yeah and make a new thing despite it you know I mean that's that's that's really important I mean for not only for a few reasons because I mean I mean it's it obviously you make a living off of pleasing your fans however you know you can't break down your whole creative what is it you think that's the case why well I I'm saying yeah I think that's the case unless I didn't sort of explain myself well enough I feel like you know you you obviously live off the fact that you make music that is pleasing to other people if other if other people had no interest in your music if your music didn't please people you know then you wouldn't be making a living off I mean there's no there's like a little linguistic trick you just did okay I pleasing if it is if it is I mean if there if there is it wasn't intentional tell me tell me tell me where I miss stepped no I don't know you missed it I just you said I'm able to live by making music that pleases my fans sure and I just and and when I say please I mean kind of maybe in the loosest terms you know mm-hmm well I just don't know I honestly don't when I'm making a music that thought doesn't come into my mind at all sure and and and not that it should you know you know I I think when you're in the middle of the you know music making process you should be ultimately focused on just the thing that you are making right then and there I think when the thought of when I I think the thought of whether or not this is going to be received well when when that thought should cross your mind is probably when all the tracks are assembled and the album is there just in its in its finished glory and you can kind of see the bigger picture for what it is because you know while you might have an idea or a concept for what you want to make while you're in the middle of making it when it's actually done it may end up like something totally different you know and and the thing is even though you have an idea you don't know what you're making you don't even really fully know what it is yet until it's completely realized so I mean yeah I mean in in you know in a weird sense I mean in in a very I guess a technical and frank sense you do make a living off the fact that people enjoy your music and they want to pay for it or they want to go to a show or they want to kind of support you in some kind of monetary way look however however yeah however you can't derail your whole creative process because of one opinion one fan sent you and you know as far as people who are in my position go I mean while I do have opinions about your music and you're free to watch those opinions or any opinion that I make you know I don't make those opinions with with you in mind you know you know just just like you don't make music necessarily with the thought in mind that like oh are my fans gonna like this you know what I'm making right here you know because you you again you don't even in the middle of the creative process until something is done you don't even know what it is yet you know it's it's kind of a preposterous place to just start thinking are people gonna like this you know it's it's not even done yet yeah I agree wrong on the same page what what you're doing on this record beat wise you know obviously working with this with this new producer for the duration of the whole record you're saying the the album is louder and and you're less shy what would you go as far as to say the album is like aggressive in a way in any way or is it just you know rather rather than speaking rather rather than speaking in a whisper you're kind of taking more of a stern tone I mean it's about it's about confronting I would say so I don't know is there aggression in a confrontation yeah probably I don't know if I would say it's aggressive though I would say the mission is to be confronting things confronting a lot of like the ugly so Vic and Stein talks about like what if you know truth isn't the be-all-end-all what if beauty is and what if what is ugly is what is wrong you have to confront the ugly truth is participating in what is beautiful and just kind of switching those ideas around and so I don't know this album is a lot about confronting the ugly inside myself and outside of myself and as it relates to color in this country and as it relates to class in this country and as it relates to education and things like that and I mean the title to so the Flies don't come is about what activities what do you do so you know these ugly things that signify death what do you do so that they don't come thank you for shedding light on that dude thank you ma'am thank you very much this is the first time I've really talked to anyone about the record outside of Kenny and you know like Al and my dad and a few other people so my language about it might be a little shaky or weird because it's been very in my own head and so you're telling me what you're kind of doing with the record conceptually and and what you're doing with the record lyrically you know sort of focusing in on these topics what is it about Kenny's production that made you want to you know sort of stick with him for the duration of this record like what is he doing musically and sonically that you feel like makes for an appropriate backdrop to these kinds of songs with these kinds of topics well for me it was um to kind of I guess loop back to what we're talking about in the beginning moving to LA LA as this mecca of of a particular style of rap and then by extension freestyle and you know these artists who are linked very closely with a jazz and blues tradition poetry tradition in just this kind of open-minded you know probing that's happening through music that that really through rap that really for me my understanding of that is is that it's in LA and that the people who started doing that kind of rap cats like Micah 9 and self Jupiter and you know it's too many name are in LA so for me it became a matter of who is a producer here who is totally aware of this brilliant tapestry who has a complete understanding of this music maybe deeper than me and the person I was able to access in my circles as Kenny Siegel and I mean Kenny Siegel used to live with peace from fellowship from freestyle fellowship like with abstract brood like he has so many legendary I mean ease and the cleaners of self jupiter-like he's worked with legends you know and guys that really have influenced my understanding of myself and my music in my craft and so having the opportunity to work with Kenny Siegel was an honor and when our first couple songs were really good and it became obvious like maybe we could do a whole album even knowing that was something that he was willing to do that that was Allah wanted to do it you know to mean that candy seagull would even make an album with me was like wow of course I would do that and it became an opportunity to explore myself in this art that I love in this place where it came from with the actual cast you know like Mike and ein is on the album and so yeah having like any Segal production my commands on the thing like I'm I'm with my my Hellfire guys writing a lot of these songs like it just I wanted to have a total I guess la experience so that is what that that record is is so before I so you you feel like even in Milwaukee you're making a record somatically that kind of has an LA vibe to it so you feel like even though you're you you personally I know I'm sorry my bad we um so this record I made it in LA I went back in May and recorded with Kenny for like 14 days oh okay you didn't say that no students oh hey there I know that's I mean that's I'm sorry I'm confusing you and we had actually done a few of the songs at the very first low in theory festival like right after it was when I met Kenny see woman to his house who recorded like three jams and then yeah I went back in May after I'd already moved back to Milwaukee and that's when we really did the heavy lifting on them it's it's awesome that you bring up freestyle fellowship because that their group that's not often referenced even though you know like the 90s are kind of hip right now again as far as like hip hop you know like referencing a lot of those older groups a lot of the hardcore groups and boom-bap groups and jazz rap groups and whenever anybody asks me about jazz rap that's one of the first groups I recommend um I feel like more that you know although I do love a Tribe Called Quest I felt like they kind of for their time embodied the idea of jazz mores ated I know absolutely I mean they embodied the idea of the jazz performer in the jazz mind and really getting crazy open on these songs both stylistically and lyrically and I mean truly right with with the improvised you know making up full songs on the spot I mean that sure yeah that alone really pushes it yeah I agree with you um all right dude I mean we've been talking for so goddamn long and I think I think I'm gonna cut it off here just for just for everybody else's sake and I mean you told me a lot about the record and I appreciate that and I don't think you know thank you for coming on and just you know being real open like like you usually are I've tried too deep so they'd serve me an opportunity to dance for problem dude 
MOAxsCaBaU4,wait again a 10 out of 10 review it again it's a 10 out of 10 review it again hi everyone Anthony Pham tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review let's let's end off this week with a good review it's an off this week with a good review of the new destroyer record poison season I actually this of their destroyer is the singer-songwriter project of singer-songwriter guy Dan Behar he's from Vancouver I love his voice I love the man's poetry he's been dropping records under this name since the 90s and you might also recall him from other musical projects and bands such as Swan Lake and the New Pornographers but I mostly enjoy his solo material this night Street Hawk as well as destroyers rubies a little bit also his 2011 album kaput and kaput was actually a huge crossover success for Dan gained him listeners that he hadn't had before and it was a bit of a stylistic change for him too it wasn't simply this kind of very verbose poetry based rock music he was playing like a little bit of art pop a little bit of refined baroque pop on this thing with a lot of reverb on it it was very refined it was very sensual it was very easygoing light on the ears and catchy while this kind of music instrumental usually just kind of falls into the background for me Dan's vocals and his poetic eccentricity made these songs come alive and kept them fun kept them engaging and putting out a record that is that successful it can kind of be like starting all over again because you have all of these new listeners that you didn't have before so the pressure can most definitely be there to come up with a good follow-up record and it doesn't seem like Dan rushed into doing so because it's been like four years since the release of kaput and this record sounds like Dan took his time with it it is lavish not only that but it doesn't really have the old-school vibe that could put had it doesn't sound like it was recorded in the 80s or is trying to recapture some older sound from years ago it actually sounds very dry very punchy very modern but in a way it kind of goes back to Dan Behar's usual poetry rock roots on poison season Dan is a lot more hushed and reserved even on some of the the louder moments here which was a little off-putting at first when I was listening to this record but ultimately it was fine and really enjoyable it just kind of has a different appeal it doesn't so much jump out at me as much as it just kind of draws me in then once you get two tracks like the opener on this album you kind of have this really sad quiet string kissed music with Dan delivering his poetry very quietly on top of it he's not just putting out rock and pop songs on every track here there are a lot of tracks here that kind of feel like interludes like theatrical detours and even when he is quiet Dan still comes off very passionate and pretty eccentric too and the poetry on the starting track actually were surfaces on a few other songs here the centerpiece of the album Times Square as well as the closer I do like the poem on this track however I'm not really totally sure what the significance of it is to the entire album because a lot of the poetry on this record is kind of esoteric and even though I really enjoy it slowly I feel like I'm kind of putting the puzzle pieces together however I kind of have this feeling that I'm going to hit a wall doing that and not sort of gain a full understanding of this record because some of the imagery that Dan brings up on this record feels so surreal that it might not have some kind of clear translation or anything like that it's just meant to be this very strange evocative image Jesus is beside himself Jacobs in a state of decimation and I like how the next track just jumps in with the heavy Sax's and the pianos and the guitars it's a really hard hit catchy just a really melodic tune feels a little Springsteen ish in a way you know some East Street Band however it sounds really good and I love the way the instrumentation comes together so intensely on the back end of the track however if there was one song where I wish Dan really picked it up vocally and just came a little harder it's this song because he does tend to get drowned out in this instrumentation a little bit though still I appreciate the the kick in the teeth right from the start on this record and even though the louder tracks in the track listing here may be essential may be fantastic it's really the quieter songs that that pull me in and get me a little emotional dan does a fantastic job of bringing his oddball charm on these tracks like with the song he'll which has these just a very nice refined baroque string sections and I love the ascending chord progression on this song - Dan's poetry on this track is lovely and it actually gets pretty Frank toward the back end of the track when the instrumentation picks up a little bit and we get some percussion in the background and the instrumental is just romping just dancing around in this really fun way and Dan is just singing it's hell down here it's hell it's hell down here it's hell the next track the river is just as luscious and overloaded with swagger with a little extra schmaltz on the horn sections and with the song girl in a sling not only is this one of the quieter tracks where Dan really pulls me in but it's at this point on the record where I actually feel like I'm listening to what Dan imagines in his head to be like his own personal musical like the the the imagery on this song what I sort of imagined in my head when I'm listening to this song is so strong I feel like I'm looking at Dan on a stage dressed exactly like this except maybe with like a I don't know like an old-school like hat from the 50s or something like that and his suit has some holes in and he's got stubble on his face and he's just like I don't know this this lovable tramp sort of character whose drunken and and heartbroken and he's delivering this poetry in the middle of an empty street at night like at 2:00 a.m. and he's just like singing up to the stars and even though it's another quiet track this song contrasts really well with the very sedate Archer on the beach which has a really slick bass line very nocturnal groove strange just reverb echoed guitars kind of coloring the space in this song and some jazzy piano flourishes too which sometimes get a little dissonant a little sour to kind of make the tone of this very open track feel a little uneasy I love how the song midnight meets the rain picks up the pace of this record perfectly and how we get a few more tracks or a little more easygoing right after I like that Dan even though a bulk of this record is sedate he does a great job of making sure with some instrumental transitions in the midst of a song or just with some good peppy tracks placed here and there throughout the tracklist that there is never sort of like a long wall anywhere on this record I think the biggest lull here is maybe solace bride which I think I think rain or scope of the record was a little redundant with its instrumentation even if I do like the poetry on this track a little bit however I do love the song bankok right after not only does this track have one of the most serene intros of any song here but it's actually got one of the best build ups too and in the second half which is very peppy is actually fantastic and I love Dan's lyrics on on this part in the song bring out your dead burning atcha live what's got into sunny again Behar with that supreme level of charm and swagger even in the midst of such obtuse lyrics he seems like this infinitely interesting and captivating and strange guy finishes off pretty well - not only with a revisitation of that poem that Dan delivered at the start of this record on the song Times Square which I forgot to mention is actually an amazing song the instrumentation on this track is great I love how consistently we get great bass lines horns pianos and hand drums placed throughout here and there on this record too I mean the the instrumentation on this record it doesn't vary too much but it's so vibrant it's so fun it's so well mixed and it's it's very colorful and there's some strong grooves on this thing to not like it's a record you want to play in a dance club or anything like that but the way the instrumentation moves it's so natural it's organic beautiful and fluid but the song Sun in the sky before the closing track here actually has some pretty strong hand drums on it too and this is maybe the most sensual song on the record the groove of it Dan's romantic poetry on this track just makes me want to just really dance just sway my shoulders a little bit of this do a little slow dance on this track with bay overall I loved this record I thought it was great even though it's not reinventing the wheel or anything like that it's dan Behar continuing to do what he does in a fantastic manner and it's it's also everything that I like about a great singer songwriter record it's well written the instrumentation is tasteful and it actually melds with the guitars and the just the the piano is the bass instrumentation really nicely it's poetic it's moving it's intimate and and and something that I think is specific to this record and kind of makes Dan unique is that when I'm listening to his music I feel really close to him you know not like in a personal way but I feel like I'm in his head but the closer I get to him the harder he is to read you know just the the closer and you look just the more blurry the image gets but when I kind of step back and I'm looking at the this record with like a wall wide shot the image is gorgeous again the piano is the sax is the hand drums they all sound great and you know sure it's a little theatrical it's a little dramatic it's it's anything but straightforward a lot of the time but if you're patient and you love good instrumentation you like some interesting poetry and you like your singer songwriters to run a little eccentric along the the fringe the poetic fringe you know there are moments here like like Times Square again where I feel like a little bit Dan is channeling his inner Lou Reed a little bit if if that's the wild side you like to walk on then I think you're gonna find a lot to like on this record I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this thing transition have you given this record of listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan o destroyer forever

everyone Anthony Fantino here you know who it is I'm here fresh off of a performance with Kumasi Washington and the next step at the historical Howard Theater in Washington DC and basically we're gonna have a quick conversation about the performance that he just had the new record and all the exciting music that he's gonna you know be coming out with along with his band members here that he was talking with on stage tonight how you doing dude pretty good pretty good Anthony how you doing I'm doing good I was just talking with some of your bandmates about this new record and you've been touring behind it you were saying on stage this is your first East Coast tour with this band and with this record you know give us an idea of what the reception's been like so far I mean the crowd here totally freaked out I mean does this been a pretty consistent reaction yeah yeah it's been amazing I mean like basically every cell has been sold out and I mean it was like a lying around the corner at the Blue Note in New York I was like totally like an aha so I can't believe this you know it's been a you know an even little small towns like you know Northampton you know it was like people are there and they're into it and they know the record and they're like the reception has been so like warm it's kind of like this guy's amazing you you were talking about how a you were a Blue Note on stage I mean that's such a historical place as is this I mean you would what's it like from your perspective to sort of be not only kind of living your dream as a musician but kind of sort of be making this impact on these historical places where I'm sure people played who have a huge influence on you you know it's um it's a bit heavy you know it's like you go play at the Blue Note and I you start to realize the lineage and like when people are looking at you like you're kind of like the next step on that evolution is kind of like oh oh but it's also like it's inspiring because it's you know we've been working for this for our whole lives you know since I was three you know and all of us like a lot of us or second generation musician so you know music kind of came with you know the whole was it was a package deal you know life and music kind of came together and so to be a part of a lineage like the Blue Note or Howard theatre it's just kind of like it's heavy but it's it's it's inspirational as well I mean you can't you can't totally be surprised about the people thinking of you as the next step I mean you did name your band after that is true that is true yeah I did that to myself but but it's a good it's a good kind of pressure you know it's pressure but it's a good pressure it's much more of an inspirational pressure than it is like a you know make me freak out pressure you know so it's it's great fun like I mean it's it's a pressure but it kind of seems like something with with that name of your band with the name of life for example the the opening tract of the new record changing in the guard with the name of the record the epic it also kind of seems like something you set out to do yeah I mean actually it was funny like so a lot of those names have like you know like puns and like like I changed the guard I actually I actually wrote that for my dad and his friends cuz like I was a kid you know my dad had a bunch of friends he's really talented a bunch of his friends were super talented a nice always just wonder how they didn't get a chance to like show themselves to the world so it was kind of like oh at least I'll have a song that you don't mean in the yeah and then I you know I definitely bit about that we've always wanted that though we've always four years we've been cultivating the sound we have and like we've taken into weird places and for crowds that should not like it and they've loved it and so we've always been saying like man if we just had a chance we could really do something special so it was like getting the chance and having it work out it's like oh wow that's cool it's a cool feeling you know but but the thing is you've been working in the music industry for a long time I mean collaborating with a lot of big artists touring with a lot of big artists and performing with a lot of big artists um it seems like the the opportunity was always there but you weren't coming out with solo stuff but but now we have this new solo record so after years of performing and recording with other artists you know what kind of pushed you to I'm gonna come out with my own record and it's gonna be three hours long and I'm gonna call it the epic and I'm gonna have these sort of really ambitious ideas for it in sort of uh really high bars that I'm that I'm gonna be setting for it you know as weird like you know I played on a ton of albums you know I knew everybody even that every record label and I you know it was around and all of us were really but it wasn't really till you know Thundercat came out with his album because you know he's in the same collected that we all grew up with Age of Apocalypse yeah Golden Age of Apocalypse when I have them came out it was like all of a sudden you know people that along with flying low knows what he was doing it made people kind of like pay attention and then it was there was an avenue for like we we recorded before we just didn't we put the albums out because there was no real place to put them out and even like the way we recorded them going in we didn't really feel that there was a place to put it it was just kind of more like something we did just because we just had to do it you know like take just ease my soul I had to like work or some music but when Lotus asked me to make it right off a brain feeder you know that and that kind of spread like it was like Stephens putting his record out and having that success and like people like understanding it and getting it like around the world and then when Louis asked me to make a record that just that it's like it was like the the light turned on for all of us and we realized man we gotta like record our music and start putting our energy towards ourselves is it's easy especially when you can't with talented musicians young you get caught up playing for other people and you just it's like a whirlwind like you playing with one person and then I kind of falls apart someone else catches you and like you now you're playing for them and this one else catches you and you're playing for them you're in a position where you're in a position where somebody wants to have that talent on their record so you're always getting these invites yeah getting these invites and you're making money and you travel around the world and you're having fun and it's like it's a beautiful thing but at the same time you can easily that's probably what happened to my dad in this generation you can you can just lose yourself you just because a powerful part of like playing for other people is like we're kind of like compromising who you are to realize their vision so like I'll take these things out I mean like my play with Chaka Khan I played 90% keyboards you know so months would go by or I was like barely playing this act or because I was doing something for someone else to realize that she needs you need to keep our player boys you need to saxophone player so I was like all of a sudden we you know that light turned on were like oh man we have all this talent all these songs that this whole sound that people really love they just don't get to hear it so we got that you have to just like kind of buckle down and you know take a bit of a hit and just you know commit to doing our own things it's a commitment thing really so uh it just kind of seems like between what you've been seeing as far as a response with live performances as well as the fact that you had a place to put the record and just this want to invest more in yourself the climate was just kind of right yeah it was right it was right at the time it was right I can tell you like any amount I finish this album in 2014 and I was like you know screaming at the stars like why is it not coming out and you know ended up being perfect timing you know after like because I didn't know that was my inner planet doing anything on Kendrick Lamar's record but like just that record coming out kind of open the door for people to be open to something like my record too and so it's an even you're dead like a mom my record was done before your dad came out so it's it's been a you know it's an even by fact that we didn't come out when we were younger cuz we were good and we were really challenged me a lot of energy and stuff like that but our little journey like playing through with all these other people has cultivate our Sun and made it kind of more rich because like there's things I learned playing with Chaka Khan and like Francisco I go bad and harm a scene that I just necessarily wouldn't have learned on my own you know so it's been you know this everything happens in this proper time and when is supposed to happen well I mean you know large touring jazz bands are fewer and more far between them they used to be so you had to kind of pick up that experience and those chops somewhere you know just with other artists playing other genres yeah absolutely absolutely yes it's a it's a it's a it's a process you know becoming a musician is like becoming a person you know I mean it's like because that's all you're doing playing music yeah yeah yeah cuz all your music is this expression of who you are so if you don't have anything in there to pull out then this is like it's just just technique it's just notes and chords yeah so a little bit about some of the album's that you said were being recorded while your album was being recorded on stage you said that there were band members of years who were simultaneously recording their own music while they were working with you and that they're gonna have their own albums coming out soon when are we gonna see some of those releases where might they end up landing how are we gonna see them promoted you know where can we hear them we're working on a partnership right now we can lead 11 our own label just because we want to kid we have a family we have a thing together so we can keep it together you want to you know I mean rather and spread it all out all over the place so we're talking to a couple of different labels about a partnership and yeah like Ronald Bruno's record is done ready to go so was Miles Mosley's record and Cameron Gray's piano player is record so we got a lot of records that are done some of them are we still working on them and some of them are like dun dun dun so soon like I mean the epic and you know with with kind of the titling of this record and everything that we were talking about before I mean it seemed like you definitely wanted to make some kind of musical impact with this with this album but do you think kind of inadvertently you're making also a generational impact a little bit because I mean there are a lot of records that I review over the course of the year and and some of which you know do take well to the people who watch don't take well and I'm very well aware that there's you know a significantly young fanbase you know watching my reviews and and even though jazz might have been a kind of alien thing to a lot of them they took two or really well and and I think you know you're seeing at these dates there are a lot of young kids showing up at some of these some of these dates you know does that sort of give you hope for the future of this music yeah absolutely I think that um it's a sign of time I think that like information is kind of more accessible than has ever been and so young kids like they can get two things they can get two anything I think they want to get to all that all they need is the is the desire and making like kind of instantly you know so as soon as they think they like I think they like music that's kind of like that improvisational or instrumental all of a sudden they can just tap into all of it which is like what I feel is kind of happening it's like they're there it's like but they've been in a dark man he's been in a dark room for so many years for our whole existence and now the rumors there's a light on forever eyes eyes are closed and now people are starting to slowly open their eyes and so you know cool stuff you know there was time and you could have something really cool but you can have a way to get it to people there was no way for them to get it now it's like if you'd have something cool it's almost hard to keep it from them you know me like you put if you have a record it's hard to keep it away from really let alone like you know I mean there's no difficulty getting it to them so now it like I think the young kids are like they're looking for something cool and like you know like what we do is we've always known that doll because like we've always taken it to places from people young kids and these people in general just you know historically are you know commonly weren't considered you know jazz fans like people who you just wouldn't think will do that like we played like Gothic clubs and stuff like that and they just dig it just this I don't know I don't know why exactly I guess there's a relatability maybe just because we all played so many different styles of music and we've kind of lived such kind of in a lot of ways common lives you know I mean we've had a lot of you know stuff that's like really embedded in our music but it's really cool I was actually talking with one of your band mates about about the fact that the record covers so many bases so many different styles of jazz music over the years sometimes stuff that like some of the jazz fusion tracks on the record you know stuff that like jazz musicians from the 50s or 60s we're kind of like wincing at or thinking like this is you know not the direction things should go in but you guys have found this way to kind of celebrate it under this one umbrella and like a really creative amazing way and just give each style so much virtuosity and and and energy yeah yes it's part of like the journey we have we played with so many different people and I played with Gerald Wilson for years and years and years who was you know I was born in 1918 and you know he still babysit Count Basie's kids and then I played with Stanley Clark you know and like realizing that like Gerald Wilson loved Stanley Clarke Astaire Sonny Clark love Gerald Wilson and like George Duke played with jo Wilson in it you know like the connections are musically I mean like we have these terms and terminology as I kind of like divide it but the reality of the music actually just the sounds that come out of the lot of instruments are very related and they're very connected and like if you just kind of ignore the you know social barriers of it and you start to realize like oh you know if you're really playing this and it's already connected to that and so it's really a natural progression over there you know it's a natural that's a natural projecting Burcu progression from like blues to jazz to rock and roll is it is naturally connect to one another if you kind of ignore what people say about it it just kind of seems like each decade of musicians wanting to kind of come up with their own thing in their own style to kind of separate themselves from the previous ten years of music and and with so many people just kind of turning a blind eye to jazz over the past few decades which in one breath is sad but in another breath it's kind of allowed you guys to just bring all this stuff together under one roof without anybody really sort of batting an eye at it yeah it's part of like you know in LA like there's a there's a whole jazz scene that's really some of my dad like that's gotten ignored and in some ways it's up for us cuz it felt like like selling like it's like we had nowhere to go there was no avenue for us to take our music but on the flip side there was no one telling us what to do no one like pushing us to do this or do that or like telling us what the rules were or like that you can't like you said you can't play jazz fusion and play swingin and play funk and play soul and play all these other different things no one was telling us that so we just normal told miles mostly that you know we played upright bass you can't put it through pedals and rock out so he did it because no one told me we couldn't do it you know so this is a gift and a curse being ignored you know and that's kind of like that's totally important but like you were talking about earlier how you know you can sort of get these kids anything and kids can get a hold of anything on the internet it just seems like now was a really opportune time to come out with this record with so many net labels out there and with the fact that you can just put out music digitally and how it's it's not necessarily as much a risk as it would have been if you were pitching a three-hour jazz record with numerous genres on it in the 90s and we're going to need all the studio time and all these musicians it seems like the the your ability to kind of just put it out digitally gave this record a chance that it wouldn't have necessarily had years ago yeah and even just like that like like like back in the day when it was like it's a fight with a with a with a CD stop owner and as to where your record got put you know you don't have to worry about that anymore because it's just a click of a button so I was like doesn't matter what she's not already put it in because kids are just gonna click around today find what they want anyway so yeah it's definitely you know you know time that the time the Rihanna's definitely a big part of what allows us what is what is allowing us to we're doing you know my dad was coming up like I said they they were dope they used to come in the house and practice and rehearse all these songs but like no one had a home studio back then like we did you know you know so it's you know it's a it's a good time in some ways and it's you know it's a hard time in some way as far as like the home studio stuff and just recording the record it it seems like you guys were able to sort of have this really modern vibrant fresh punchy clean recording but you were able to kind of keep it sounding really dynamic and organic and in the moment it's it's like you know it sounds new it sounds kind of like it fits in the digital age but kind of that I don't know that that in the moment feel of it isn't isn't lost in the process of pulling it together yeah I mean a big part of as Tony Austin the drummer in the band is it was the engineer so it was kind of like he had he's he's a very technical kind of guy but he's also a musician so he understands that like in the end it's the connection between the musicians that really comes across to people especially economies as we're playing so that was cool to have someone who's engineering it who already understands that because a lot of just playing it is playing it yeah who was if you have explain that like look you can't put me in a booth but four walls I can't see anyone because yeah it sounds cleaner but then you lose a connection so we a lot I mean most of the record is we're all playing in one room you know face to face you know I mean it's that's where that feeling that it feels kind of old and out sense but it's new in that like who Dave record digitally and like we were isolated in a way you know so it kind of sounds like he you know what engineering the record playing on the record being a fantastic drummer to sort of be a musician and thrive in the modern age you've got to wear so many hats you know you've got to be able to do so many different things you can't just it's not enough just to be a great musician you've got to be able to record yourself for a range or whatever you know uh what hats do you sort of see yourself wearing aside from you know just being a great saxophonist oh yeah all of them I mean I'm you know like I mean I tried to let go in this record and not like you know I like Tony engineered it and I got measurement tyranny mixed it but you know and in the end they end up right there with them you know explaining what the music is promoting it you know you know just pulling all these musicians together you know like talented musicians come normally with pretty strong personalities there's a lot of like there's a lot of like hold on hold on wait wait wait wait wait put your knives away you know me let's let's talk about this and you know so there's that there's you know the writing and composing I mean it's you you and if you're gonna if you're gonna realize your dream your vision musically in this day and age you're gonna have your hands in every stage of it even like the artwork it was like you know I was with the photographer scouting out places that we should go take pictures and you know even the fonts and everything else was like you find yourself just in every phase like it's you have to come you involved which is good and it's bad it's like it's like because I mean that's why you know John Coltrane you know recorded for like nine years and has like 40 albums because he just came into a studio recorded and walked away and then two months later an album was out in the streets you know you know me is a musician in this day and age you you really have to do everything so which makes it more who you are from top to bottom but it just takes longer sort of talking about that process of getting everyone who is a talented musician to sort of agree on the the recording of the song or each person's part or or whatever a while that can kind of seem really difficult in that could kinda seem like a like a bit of a headache I think the music has a certain characteristic to it when you've gone through that process oh yeah yeah yeah and I was pushing for them to be more to put more of themselves into the music almost to the point whatever get upset sounds like blame or do or do something you know make it you and like it is me and but I said I wanted I wanted to feel like I mean because I make so much in music today like it's a litte bit of this like these there's a star mentality where like it's like oh it's one person that I didn't want to feel like - I think like the best music is a communal thing music to me connects people it doesn't separate them that's exactly what I was telling when your bandmates one of the greatest things about the record is that it feels so communal yeah yeah that's what I was a career I wanted I wanted to feel like I mean even though that they're my songs I wanted you to I want each person to put themselves in it like put put you put something in there you know I mean like I would leave room for that and like even as like you know we play live I just if you want to change something change it you know like there's nothing wrong with something being different than the way I imagined it maybe you know I think it's really great you know in the modern age that were able to sort of have one person create more music than they would have been able to years ago just because of technology and the digital age and everything but but again the the collaborative process with numerous musicians that are this talented the music comes out in a way that that it never could with just one person by themselves yeah absolutely I mean and it's um and it didn't back in the day either he like he would he get down to like he talked about people like you know I mean talk to George do can you talk to like you know I did some stuff Quincy Jones and like there were a lot of people involved by their horn arranger string arrangers lyricist songwriters producers engineers and they've all had their part in making something you know I mean and that's what this was a little different it was and then I was more or less giving the performers that kind of license to like you know like like Brandon Coleman you're the Cure you're a master at creating sounds on a keyboard so what do you hear you know I mean I can hear something I can tell you to do something but I think it'd be cooler because I'm already infused in this there's already a truckload of Kumasi in this song I'd love to get some Brandon Coleman in here because I think I make it more interesting and then you can't I can't like I can't put Brandon Coleman into the record I can only put more myself in there so I was kind of like you know like a musical gumbo in that sense you know rather than musical soup so the the the tour seems to be going well the performances are going great the record seems to be well-received when the tour is over kind of what's your next step what's your next focus really getting these other albums out that's what we're all really focused on you know I'm focusing on that I mean and then my own stuff as well I'm when I was working on this when I was making this album I had this crazy story that kind of as I was doing the singing choir stuff I kind of like I don't know dream to half of it and kind of made up half of it and ended up kind of being what made me leave the song leave the album three get three discs long so you know I've told a couple of people the whole story and like when I hear that whole story is like oh it makes so much sense now so I have written down was just written down and all kind of crazy little pieces like so I'm kind of like bring them all together like part of is written in a little folder I have and post-its and on top of music and it's just kind of all over the place but I'm gonna pull that story together and maybe make some kind of like graphic novel or something like that that can sort of like you can listen to their album and kind of see the story that made it be what it is you know that sounds even more ambitious than just coming out with another record huh yeah I was like in China front of times like now I have to put on a writer like you know you know have to hire an illustrator yeah yeah yeah my sister's amazing art I have a lot of artist mom in my life actually there that are really really amazing so I have to get someone that now I can't have a vision for what it will be visually you know I have to just kind of like you know layman style I mean like it's funny like I'm in a reverse you know situation because usually as musicians you have like people who aren't necessarily that musically trained trying to tell you what they want and they don't know the terminology and this so now I'm gonna be in that position like trying to tell this illustrator like no more like fuzzy ish you know don't make it so blind yeah but it'll be fun good all right man thanks for talking to good I really appreciate it performance is great record is great and again thanks for doing this interview oh yeah thank you man thanks coming out thanks for all the support 
ceGwAb1HiAY,hi everyone no theny more tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new weakened record Beauty behind the madness the weakened is the pseudonym of a Canadian alternative R&B singer by the name of Abel Tesfaye who broke on the internet several years ago through a handful of mixtapes that had a really ethereal moody and slightly whiny sound it was a run of three mixtapes the last of which I actually liked quite a bit echoes of silence however all the things I liked about this final weekend mixtape didn't really carry over on to Abel's first big commercial release kiss land I don't think the tunes were really there on this record and a lot of the production was pretty stagnant as as well I think a lot of these songs were a kind of tedious and honestly I wasn't really expecting too much of this record until I heard one of the more recently released singles from it can't feel my face which was a legitimate pop song a pretty significant change for Abel sound I mean there was a strong beat on this thing a grooving bassline really slick tune overall in the hook was really catchy even though it did sort of have the the usual notes of moodiness that you would catch out of Abel's vocals it was an upbeat track at least on the instrumental front and going into this record I was basically looking forward to seeing if Abel was going to make a full transition into just more pop-oriented music something a little more engaging and something a little less wallowing in its own fabricated sadness for the most part Abel tries to do that though I wouldn't say the results are all there though we are getting some pretty noticeable changes right from the start of this record like with the song real life which mood-wise feels like your typical we can track but there are large string sections backing this track and overall the instrumental feels pretty refined it feels like the weekend as usual but elevated to a higher instrumental plane and the changes continue on tracks like loser and tell your friends one of these tracks has a pretty large booming beat behind it and some rich pianos and shimmering keys and later into the track we get what kind of sounds like a swing rhythm and a huge freakin horn section I admire this tracks ambition though I do think the instrumental is like a little bit of a traffic jam like not every moment matches up with the one before it and yeah it's it's it just feels like a little cluttered like able put all of his instrumental ambitions into this one song and then the other track on here actually feels like a bit of old-school soul music with some great pianos and guitars and you know just like a just just a vintage beat to it don't some you could really snap your fingers - feels real sexy feels real sensual it's exciting to hear able sort of pushing himself into new territory on this record but he does very little to actually change his singing style which I think sounds really out of place against these more upbeat instrumental rich backdrops even though I don't care for a lot of that older weekend stuff at least the synthetic ethereal beats that you might find on house of balloons kind of fit his bill a little bit better which kind of stinks because I like some of these instrumentals a lot I just wish they were complemented with more ambitious vocals for one track after another we're still getting Able's kind of whimper e soprano delivered with what I imagine would be this kind of sad puppy-dog face the same one that you see on the cover of this record but there was one noticeable vocal change on the song the hills where Abel's singing just reached this level of depravity and got really low and breathy and monie he kind of sounded like this I don't know this alternative R&B Marilyn Manson with a really heavy synthetic beat hanging in the background which I didn't really care for sounded really dry sounded really flat the synth bassline on this track was just oppressive smother to every single thing in the mix other than the vocals some of the beats here while I that they're trying to do something big musically and instrumentally they really lack some good mixing and some good you know wet reverb ii effects sometime just to give the the instrumental some room and some vastness and a little bit of breathing room between each piece of instrumentation and the mix on tracks like the hills those synth bass lines that they can really just cover everything up and just make the song feel really flat and dimensionless but there are some tracks on the track listing here that sort of fit into the weekends usual style but are definitely better written than a lot of the songs on kiss land definitely have a stronger hook like the song often we have an instrumental that sort of feels like your average ethereal weekend instrumental with a little bit of a trap percussion hanging in the background and story-wise we kind of get you know yet another tale of this girl who is like you know just wandering about the world and doesn't know what's going on and all of a sudden she happens upon able the weekend the crew these bad boys and is invited into this world of parties and drugs and sex and money it's all little you know predictable at this point and then with the song earned it bit we're faced with yet another moment where Abel's vocals just don't really fit over the instrumental that that kind of has a bit of an old-school vibe to it kind of sounds like something like a more expressive soul singer R&B singer such as a Teddy Pendergrass or like Usher would would totally slay on but instead we're getting this sort of again whimper II cold fish performance and then we have the closer on here angel which is just a really overly glitzy track kind of sounds like a bit of I don't know 80s power ballad reor rock music going on here it's it's a little weird it's got these reverb guitars and these big choral vocals and it's just trying so hard so hard to be huge and bigger than life and be this gargantuan powerful emotional moment but with how high the vocals are mixed on this track it just ends up sounding like really expensive karaoke and it just feels manipulative man just like a lot with a lot of older weaken tracks just this forced sense of depression and sadness or you know I hope you find someone else I hope you love fine love with someone else huh like I get it but the thing is what makes can't feel my face so enjoyable is that it doesn't entirely depend on that forced sadness the instrumental the be the groove of the hook it's all on its own really catchy you could hand that song to numerous talented singers and you would still get a good track this song is not dependent on the weakens usual moodiness however many other songs on here are because honestly there's nothing really sad about anything that Abel sings on these songs so the idea of shrouding these lyrics in sad moody music and vocals again timmy is just really forced and entirely a put on the guest appearance is on this record of which there are a few are actually not that bad labyrinth on here sounds pretty good Lana Del Rey actually hits a few expressive moments on this track where she appears maybe there's like a little bit of chemistry between her and Abel and I understand I see the excitement because they both kind of play the role that they're constantly singing about in their stories Abel is always singing about women who are looking for a bad boy and looking to be taken advantage of and looking to be brought into this world of sex and drugs and danger and Lana does nothing but but sing from the standpoint of that person in her music so I mean really it's a match made in heaven they should probably do a full-length record together and Ed Sheeran on here who typically I don't like performs really well on the track where he appears with Abel I think they actually duet really well on this track it's not like you know you're just getting Edie for a little while and then Abel for a little while they're actually you know trading lines back and forth and it sounds really good Abel actually raises his energy level a little bit the the performance doesn't sound phoned in or anything like that it's it's a really good collaboration I give this record kudos on the collaborations really from from front to back and one more bright spot for me in the back listing here is the song shameless kind of a unexpected acoustic ballad in the tracklisting here which I mean I liked that they went into that instrumental direction but the tune here the song here despite a few cringe-worthy lines here and there like I'm gonna fuck you like that kind of shit aside from that it's actually a good song it's actually a good tune one of the weakens better songs overall with this record I'm kind of indifferent I don't really like it but I don't really dislike it but that's not because I thought the whole record was boring I thought there were tracks on here that were like supreme lows for me but there were other tracks here that I thought were highs that I thought were great I think able kind of saw the writing on the wall with kiss land and was like I I can really only take this style so far either I've sort of run out of ideas to execute this style or it's it's it's only going to go so far in terms of relevancy maybe people aren't as interested in it as they used to be when I originally came out with house of balloons so I got to change things up I got to bring in some big instrumentals I got to do some stylistic changes as well and I admire that I like that I like that he took risks on this record some of them paid out some of them didn't but this is kind of a long record I feel like there were tracks here that were obviously redundant obviously didn't work and they could have been cut from the tracklisting and you still would have had a decent record that was around 40 minutes in length not all the kinks were kind of smoothed out and worked out maybe these will be smoothed out in future releases I hope so because again the tracks that I really liked shameless and I can't feel my face the duet and collaborative tracks on here the song angel to an extent to an extent I thought there were real highs on this record it's just that it doesn't dish them out consistently that's all I'm feeling a decent strong 5 on the stang transition have you given session have you given the starter to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Santana music review internet forever 
jjORabLD8Y0,don't follow here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new dope body record conch called dope body is a baltimore maryland band that I've been following pretty closely since the release of their full-length record natural history a few years ago great record love it it's primal it's noisy it's killer it'll smash your face and rock your hips and get you sweating all night long give a listen to it give a lesson to it yeah that record to me was just very visceral carefully crafted insanity however the follow-up to that album lifer wasn't as groove heavy wasn't as like hard heavy beats it was a bit speedier a bit Messier a little more in the moment kind of felt like a live recording but kind of psychedelic and how all of the guitars the drums and the vocals were melting together in this really cacophonous intense mix and some pretty good songwriting on this record - even though dope body as abrasive as they are and as crazy and cuckoo and and as nutty as they are they write some good tunes now I spoke with a few members of this band recently about their forthcoming record over here kunk because I was excited about it and I got a little insight into the creative process of this record the writing and the recording process and the band was essentially telling me that a lot of these songs were derived from improvisation jams that they were doing together either just straight improvisation or just kind of ideas conjured during these jams during these improvisation and then taking these ideas and sort of putting them into a studio recording so after hearing that knowing that understanding that I was looking forward to hearing how that kind of impacted the final product on their latest record over here and I actually think it's pretty clear from the start that that is exactly the approach that dope body took when recording songs on this record improvised and in the moment and on the fly is how many songs on the album feel the opening track casual has a very tense heavy groove to it there's some awesome drums on this track shots of guitar feedback and noise all over this thing but the beat the groove it's very like I said tense it's repetitive its redundant in a way it's hypnotic it's like dope body is just taking this one idea and trying to string it out as long as possible with just a couple variations here and there just kind of jumping back and forth between these two guitar variations to kind of give the the song some contrast and in some sense of verse-chorus verse-chorus or whatever but it actually doesn't really do too much to make the song feel like it's it's moving in a direction the track actually feels kind of cyclical kind of like a I don't know like a like a bit of a musical purgatory like you're stuck in one spot after that dope body goes in a completely different territory with the song dad which is this really odd slow-mo rock detour that sounds like a freaking nightmare I just wish it were longer you know and not just kind of this weird experimental bit that we only get like a glimpse of on this very brief album dope body get some crazy freakin like insane ideas down to tape I think I might favor the song I think I might favor the album lifer a little bit more because I think the writing is better it's a little more wet I think I might favor the album lifer a little bit more because the writing is there it's a little more coherent but some of the spots on this record are jaw-droppingly strange or just really gut reaction like explosive like the song void the clothes are here which is the longest track on the record it actually sort of has a length to it that I wish a lot of songs here did the build on this song is fantastic it's really tense it really catches me and I'm locked into it and then by the time the drums really kick in and the vocals really kick in doe body reaches a level of like animalistic insanity I haven't even heard them approach on previous records I think the energy is there I think the performance is there I think it was easy for the band members to get whipped up into the intensity of some of these recordings as they were making them but standing on the outside of that just as the listener I think on the writing end of things this track and a lot of other tracks on here that feel similarly improvised are kind of lacking kinking I think the sound I think the recording on this record is great though even though the writing is an always top-notch because dope body is just kind of throwing ideas out there to an extent just kind of throwing shit at the wall seeing what sticks again the sound and the mix and just some of the weird experiments and the noises that end up on these songs are really ear catching Punk is just really about break neck decisions and just really letting go of inhibitions that would usually be keeping you from doing something a little weird a little inaccessible and dope body kind of cobbles all these strange recordings and ideas together onto this record which doesn't flow in any kind of coherent way it kind of sounds like an experimental punk bands Frankenstein monster of an album however there are some tracks on the track listening here though while they do have that improvised feel and that really noisy cacophonous in the moment intensity they do feel fully fleshed and they do feel like like a good idea was conjured here it feels like dope body they're trying to flex their improvisational muscles on this record and sometimes it works out sometimes it doesn't in the case of the song old gray it sounds great tons of sharp feedback on this track really great groove a great drum beat grimy grimy bassline I love the odd vocals on this track as well and the song obey to this song is creepy as hell one of the creepiest rock songs I've heard in a while whereas muddy dune or Ash toke feel more like a a fleeting bit of stimulation so many of the tracks on here could have been much more interesting if there was only a point B for the song to travel to from the point a where it starts and sometimes that that doesn't happen because the band doesn't really try to progress the song musically in any kind of way or the song just kind of ends out of the blue before it really has the chance to establish itself or leave a lasting impression this album just really kind of feels like a bit of a mixtape of sorts or just like a really well recorded demo or something like that I've just not completely realized ideas but they're still kind of exciting and fun to listen to the track goon line is definitely an example of that I mean not only is the guitar riff on this track like a weird psych rock throwback and it just has this heavy this lumbering groove that plays throughout the song but the noisy guitars and the vocals and the the really just hard aggressive drumming on this track it makes the song hilariously ugly like it's just so garish I just puts a smile on my face with just how how gruesome it sounds very few bands kind of go into the studio with this freewheeling sort of notion of experimenting and just being like you know fuck it whatever happens sort of happens and in this record really puts that feeling forward it's entertaining in its most aggressive and high-volume moments and it's pretty entertaining as well during some of the quieter spots here like the song down which might kind of feel like a very easygoing kind of aloof quiet little rock tune but it's it's actually pretty sweet and enjoyable for what it is I think this record is good it's very good it's very interesting to hear a band like dope body put themselves in a risky spot like this but I do wish this album was longer you know for as experimental and is out there as it is you'd think that more stuff would have ended up on this record but maybe the band was sort of doing these improvisational recordings doing these weird experiments but then when it came time to finally decide what made it onto the record they were super critical and and super discerning about what people actually ended up hearing maybe they thought a lot of what they ended up recording wasn't worthy of making it onto the record and that's why we're sitting here with just merely a 33 minute album I think what ended up here is cool I just wish it was longer I just wish it was a little bit more satisfying I just wish there was more to grapple with here because I think the moments on this record that are great are some of dope bodies best work I'm feeling a decent of strong seven on this thing transition have you get a position have you given the soccer to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you eat it why what do you think I should review next and and that's it the Anthony Santana music review internet forever 
W6R_GYuasOo,uh hi everyone green theny grass tan oh you're the Internet's busiest music nerd and I'm here to talk about Apple music which I have done in numerous videos so far relating to not only the music streaming business model but also Taylor Swift and the whole kind of beef thing she had going on with them for a minute but this video is more personal more directly relating to me and I guess I'm just here to say that coming this October 3rd once the Apple music once my Apple music 3 month free trial is over I will be paying for Apple music and no not because they came to my house and they held me down at gunpoint and said that if you don't pay for the service Anthony we will kill you and we will kill your family though I'm sure that's written into Apple's terms and services somewhere no I'm paying for the service because I want to and it's it's for a handful of reasons one I think the app which it's it's already iTunes it's just apple music worked into the iTunes app is pretty fast and efficient previously with other music streaming platforms I have had issues with their apps and with their their their websites running a little slow so I actually like the speed and efficiency that I am able to sort of stream music off of the Apple music platform and new albums do come out I'm actually able to play songs off their platform with like the same ease that I would any song that is downloaded into my own personal music library so and on top of that I actually have access to a huge music library and I guess I'm guaranteed to sort of have access to records once they immediately come out which is nice because when records come out I want to hear them because I them actually on on this very youtube channel believe it or not and I know that a lot of other music streaming services offer just as much music as Apple does and I'm not saying that that's necessarily 100% a selling point for Apple music it's just that I guess I just like the interface through which I'm listening to all of this music and actually over the past several months that I've been using Apple music there had been records that I got ahold of on Apple sort of listening to them before I was actually even able to hear them on Spotify which I was pretty happy about so for me those are kind of the basic necessities I guess and the fact that they do have some really nice and creative playlists that they pull together and curate on the platform that's that's a really good bonus actually found the playlist on Apple music to be kind of eclectic once you actually dig into them and then they actually made some cool recommendations to me to like some cool deep cuts lists of bands that I really really love like LCD Soundsystem and Liars as well as Tim Hecker too so it's it's actually cool to see a music streaming service that seems like it's it's it's really pinpointed on the tastes of the person using it that's nice that's nice that's a nice thing though I will say the radio stations on on Apple music you know and when you click onto the pop station of the reggae station or the whatever station some of the pics can be a little generic I will say it does seem like the pics are made sort of with the idea in mind that we need to appeal to the most general idea of a reggae listener for example possible rather than bringing something kind of eclectic to the table though I guess in a way the playlist kind of make up for that and it's it's it's good to see that side of the music listening spectrum represented in a music streaming service often it really isn't on a lot of music streaming services I mean I've been using Spotify for months and months and months and months and months and not once was I ever interested in any playlists that they put in front of my face but uh you know as soon as I hopped on Apple music I was like cool thrash metal playlists yeah yeah give me that give me that so I like the way the app works even though it did kind of mess up my my app on my phone when I downloaded Apple music it was not not messed up but it was a totally different app and there was a bit of a learning curve there which is going to turn some people off understandable and if you don't have an iPhone and you're on like an Android or something like that you probably won't have much interest in it either like I said in my previous videos a lot of these music streaming services are very comparable to one another like they're edging out in front of one another with just the slightest of thing so we have a little bit more sound quality we have a few more cool playlists we have a couple more exclusives than the other guys nothing really that that makes me say hands down this is the best music streaming service but given that I've already got one of these and doing this is like like my profession it makes sense for me to be subscribed to some kind of music streaming service since I'm consuming so much music on a regular basis so that I can hop on camera and report on it so that's essentially why subscribing to a music streaming service makes sense for me does it make sense for you I don't know and if it does which platform is most compatible for you which one is most convenient for you and yeah and and and I do want to say that just because I'm subscribed to a service now I'm planning on continuing with Apple music it doesn't mean that I'm not going to be buying music it doesn't mean that I'm not going to be supporting artists and supporting labels it doesn't mean that I don't care about physical mediums anymore it's just that I'm sort of in a position where doing this is convenient doing this is easy doing this means that I'm going to be able to get a review out faster or I'm not going to have to worry about where I'm going to hear a record or what quality is it going to be in or whatever or if one of you are recommending a record to mean you're like hey Anthony I really wanted to hear this new album it's great yada yada yada I can immediately jump onto here and give it a try I don't have to you know sort of worry about scrounging through the internet to to find it I can just pop over here and it's there however even though I'm subscribing to this service it'll sort of be interesting to see how many people end up sticking with Apple user come this fall I know that this situation makes sense for me but a lot of people aren't really in my position and might not be into paying the $10 a month that Apple music asks for or any music streaming service really especially with services like Spotify out there offering what they offer for free though I have heard some rumors here and there just rumors just rumors that they might consider doing premium just premium so that people can you know pay that monthly fee and hear all the music that they want on that Spotify platform and Spotify isn't a bad service I mean I've used it for a long time it's just that I just prefer the Apple music app and I was just impressed with the playlist and impressed with the curation and I just figured services like these are really the future whether they are paid or free this is how people want to consume music now which is why I'm here saying well I might as well you know take the plunge hop on a service and this is the service I've decided to go with transition have you become a streaming platform shell

-uzLOwBzevU,hi everyone harmony staccato here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Carly Rae Jepsen record emotion Carly Rae Jepsen is a Canadian pop song stris you remember from the time where she was gonna call you maybe but her phone must have died because I haven't really heard that much from her since since the release of that big breakout smash single however uh she is in fact back with a new full-length album but to be completely honest I wasn't really excited for this LP looking forward to this LP since so many deep cuts on her last album were kind of unsatisfying nowhere near as catchy or as enjoyable as call me maybe but call me pleasantly surprised because I actually find this new record here to be pretty sweet I like it encounter chested - I'm like an album - jelly jet spin and this album she has e motion electronic motion or is it emo in the ocean you don't even know what emo is I do - I know what that is it's a bird it's a big bird Lange and that's not what it is emotion as a record actually has quite a bit going for it Carly has taken that sweet innocent girl-next-door vibe that she had on her last album and her big smash singles and she's made it translate onto a new record that has more fantastic and more mature instrumentals and she's worked in a few great ballads in the track listing here - doing production on this record we have a lot of people doing production on this record and Co songwriting I really cannot get to all of them but the names that stood out to me were Greg Kurstin Devante Hines aka blood orange we also have rostam from freaking vampire weekend doing some production on this thing cool and Greg Wells again among many other people there are a lot of producers here I'm actually pretty surprised at how consistent a sound Carly was able to get on this album while working with so many different people a lot of the songs on here seem like a pretty sharp mix of new and old while I wouldn't call every track here a hit or a potential hit at least every song on this record sounds at least somewhat radio ready maybe a little to radio ready in the case of tracks like la hallucinations which has this heavy-handed synthetic beat and the song warm blood which is maybe my least favorite track here not really sure where the song came from among all these other tracks that seemed so well written in so punching and so concise the off-kilter beat here just seems so out of place against Carly's voice and there's not really that strong of a tune on this track either this song is just really not doing this record any favors and I have no idea why it made onto the standard version even though every bonus track on the deluxe version of this record is better even the very short song Blackheart which really could have used a stronger ending I don't think the tracks on this LP that are more electronically driven are bad but my favorite cuts on here are the songs that have more of a balance between these synthetic elements and instrumentation sounds a little bit more organic the songs with more variety in the instrumentation and the kind of pop songwriting that you'd usually catch on a record coming out of the 80s Carly and her songwriters and her producers hint toward this on the opening track here come away with me which features this like blaring by the Beach saxophone that opens the whole record up although I think her and her producers kind of lose sight of this sound when the hook comes around and we kind of have these just just thrusting pummeling electronic beats and these kinds of like group vocal bits that sound like kids are singing come away with me sounds more like something that would end up on like an m83 record however even though Carly and her producers lose sight of that sound on the opener they hold it throughout the track on the title track here emotion fantastic song the punchy drums the sweet bass line on this thing the really sugary scents on here not only do they have a real awesome dynamic on them that that delivers a great groove but this instrumental feels kind of like a nod to just 80's pop and rock music as well as a lot of the newer pop acts out there that are using instrumentation using live instrumentation or using more organic instrumentation in their productions or at least instrumentation that sounds organic PPP people like Meghan Trainor or hiam or Mark Ronson or Pharrell and this works for Carly too on this record works for her on the awesome ballad all that really amazing slow jam with a little slap bass in there too sounds great and I love her vocal lines on this track especially when a we reach that crescendo in the track tell me dude you bought me and then we have the song boy problems it's blood problems like the instrumental on this track I swear to god it sounds like 97 era Daft Punk really great beat on this track and the song you're tight is probably the best marriage of modern radio pop and old-school synth pop that I've heard in you know in in a while Isle Isle but the album never feels dated never feels vintage just kind of feels like it has a bit of an old soul and and actually came through with the sort of quality level that you expect out of those older records and thankfully Carly brings it back even on some of the more synthetic tracks here that that sound like simple modern bubblegum pop like on the song gimme love which may have an overly simple hook but give it now dim enough give me enough game enough give enough touch one of the few moments on this record where I feel like the lyrics are redundant but not quite as redundant as they are on the song I really like you a song that does make me groan a little bit I will say however I understand if you like it it's the album's big big single it's Carly's attempt at another call me maybe however if you've heard this song you know what I'm saying I really really really really really wish you put some other lyrics in that hook you know just like a few other words but in a way I do understand that this simplicity that this expression of I really really really really really want something like something sort of works toward that cute girl next door' demeanor that Carly sort of has going throughout this record I mean drinking some tequila and saying the word damn are probably this album's most glaring instances of misbehavior and I think that's a good thing I don't think there's enough modern pop out there that that emphasizes genuine sweetness and innocence to be honest and not that I mind blatant references towards sex or cussing or crudeness in music I really don't in fact I often enjoy it but for Carly given her track record thus far and just sort of the stuff she sings about and and just how sweet and sugary her tunes are and it would kind of be like a break in character for her the songs on this record aren't really crude in any sort of manner these tracks are about just intense crushes and young love but with like a level head like on the song let's get lost which is a legitimately precious little pop tune about wanting to literally get lost while on a drive route on an adventure with this person who you have a crush on to sort of you know extend that experience it's a song that is simple in sentiment but also a reminder that the little moments are important that quality time is important cuddles and kisses are good and again I just like that Carly is bringing that innocence back on this record and doing it with some good tunes and some great instrumental backdrops her and her producers and her writers had some great years for instrumentation on this thing you could tell they wanted to keep it new keep it fresh keep a contemporary but in a really strong way reference these pop relics from the 80s in a very tasteful way I'm feeling a decent strong seven on this thing transition have you given this wrecker to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana carly rae jepsen emotion forever hey everyone its ya boy anthony Fantana over

bNSgWqhyTfc,oh hi everyone it's Cal Church St here the internet and it's time for album tak about the new beast tas the depression Cherie me and Andy been tacking and he says I should be doing more of these reviews because Cal you got good fats in your head when it comes to the music so beast ass is a music and the cover is red as you see and the album has sangs on it lots of them like so many and when you hear it here's pretty good it here's here's real nice Oh bye-bye come back come back yes I'm sitting why is that so hard for you to get I'm sitting down hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new beach house record depression cherry this is the latest full-length LP from famed dream pop duo beach house Victoria Legrand Alex Callie and I have been waiting for this record for quite a long time not just because I wanted to hear a new beach house record but also because I've been waiting for beach house to change up their sound in some kind of significant way surely a duo as talented as beach house wouldn't just simply paint themselves into the corner of dream pop for the entirety of their career would they I mean I get it you're really good at the genre of music you're really good at making these slow syrupy heavenly pop songs with your keyboards and your drum machines and your slinky guitars they were even good at it when they introduced a multitude of instrumentation on to their big breakout record teen dream which was actually pretty fantastic and then they were even pretty good at it as they returned to more familiar territory on their next full-length album bloom where once again we had a very simple hey Z sound complimenting some very lovely ballads on this record it was a solid record but I just wish it explored and I wish it forged forward in the same way that teen dream did when it came out bloom was not really satisfying in that sense so going into depression cherry I was hoping that that's what beachhouse would deliver this time around and that's that's actually what I thought I was going to get when I heard the initial single from this thing Sparks and I will talk about that track later in this review but I will say overall beachhouse does sound like they are experimenting on this album not so much with instrumentation but more with sound just the the mixing same thing at their core beachhouse still sounds like the same duo they're still making this really slow serene beautiful music that you lost your virginity to very awkwardly back in high school or college which is why beach house is so hard to listen to today for you but beach houses approach this time around is nowhere near as hazy and enveloping Alex's guitars on this LP are noticeably clearer brighter Victoria's keyboards are nowhere near as reverb so if you're not getting these keys just just so drenched in effects that they are creating this wall of sound and cascading over one another rather the keyboard sound relatively dry as do the drum machines a lot of the time and even Victoria's vocals I mean she's taking a different approach to singing this time around not really giving us those deep bellowing vocals that we've heard on numerous records before she's kind of singing in her upper register on numerous tracks here and it doesn't sound too bad and it's cool that we're getting beachhouse sort of without all the effects we're getting them in what feels like a bit more of an intimate setting this time around but I don't think this change is a lelee for the better with every sound in the mix here being so tangible I don't really think beach house has that cushy atmosphere that kind of softened the blow of just how simple and instrumentally skeletal a lot of their songs are in a way this album sort of helps me realize just how kind of key to beach houses equation that atmosphere that reverb kind of was because as a result of these tracks just being not so drenched in effects any issues in the instrumentation in the songwriting on this record tend to be glaring because there's not really anything to sort of hide behind like the sudden ending of the track 1037 which kind of left me feeling like they didn't really have an end written for that track or even the song beyond love and this song I actually did like I think tune wise it's one of the better cuts on this record and I actually enjoyed Victoria's lyrics on this track some of the most direct and loving lyrics I think I've heard her put into a song yet but then there's the track Triple P where the guitar line on this track it just kind of feels like beach house reincorporating old ideas from older records there's actually quite a bit of deja vu for me on this album maybe it kind of hurts to be very familiar with beach house at this point in their career and then listening to this album it just really feels like a rehash except for the fact that Victoria is kind of incorporating these spoken word vocals here and there in the track though I wouldn't say they bring that much character or make the song interesting since those vocals tend to be kind of muttered and obscured which is kind of weird because typically on every other track here vocals pretty clear pretty intelligible and these spoken-word vocals just land on what seems like a beach house instrumental that could have landed on any one of their previous records had it just been you know layered more heavily in effects and the song is actually one of the longest tracks here and tediously finishes with this repetitive guitar line where I think things are supposed to be building underneath it and kind of I don't know just slowly ascending or creating some kind of a intensity whatever it's trying to do it just really loses me after a while because there's there's not that much going on and the song sparks that I said I would mention again earlier the lead single off of this LP I don't care for it as much in the context of this record as I did what I initially heard it and I gave several listens when it first came out I liked it but then listening to on this record I just kind of felt like I was listening to a totally different track it's it's really strange it's almost as if I got reintroduced to the song again for the first time but then I had the opposite reaction of when I had first heard it and I guess my reasoning this time around now that I'm more familiar with the track is that I like the textures of it this track is really shoegaze II it's one of the thicker songs here and it most definitely feels like a nod to My Bloody Valentine especially with how just textured and burning the guitars are as well as the keyboards are kind of sour and strange but then as I listen to this track more and more melodically there's not a single thing I like about this song the chord progression is like hideous the vocal melody is completely unlikable and so are the guitar leads again melodically nothing about the song is enjoyable on this record I just kind of got the feeling that beachhouse wanted to do a more upfront album but didn't really have the the fantastic songwriting that usually appears on their records to back it up at least out most of the time or the tracks on here that are actually pretty good songs they didn't flesh them out with their normal array of effects so they feel kind of bare and unfinished to a point and I really don't get what point they were trying to prove by essentially stripping out the atmosphere stripping out this essential part of the Beach House song equation but not really changing much of anything other than that you'd figure if they wanted to step out past the reverb a bit they would provide something new in place of it or maybe reveal something that was being obscured by the reverb or use that space not being taken up by reverb to add more sounds or more instrumentation or just different musical approaches but they really don't do that the changes that beach house does make on this album are so faint that they barely register sort of like on the song Bluebird as well as Wallflower tracks that I don't really mind musically and in song wise I don't think they're bad tracks but again they just kind of feel brief a little unfinished and if there's any noticeable change about these tracks it's that the drum machines the beats here do feel like faintly faintly danceable like there's a little bit of a groove here and there that pops up which is a little new for beach house usually not a duo that embraces the groove but they do a little bit here and um it's it's not bad I wish they just went a little harder on it so this record would feel kind of distinct from their other releases I think the only track on this entire record that really impressed me through and through from beginning to end like there's not a single thing I would change about the track there's not a single thing unlikable about the track is actually the open or levitation and personally I'm pretty picky when it comes to my openers there are a lot of good openers out there but not a lot of great openers or sir sir-sir there is actually an atmosphere around this track unlike many of the other songs here and it's got a lot of layers to it and for whatever reason the atmosphere on this track it feels like it accelerates as the song moves along I actually feel like I'm moving when I'm listening to this track it's like taking a hot air balloon up to heaven and Victoria Legrand's vocals on this track are a perfect complement not only because of just the way the instrumentation feels like it has this strong sense of momentum but also because they open up the record and you get these lyrics on this track talking about you know come with me I want to take you to a place come on come on and it's just so alluring and by the time the track is over I'm just like yes I want to come with you I want to go take me take me with you and then once I'm there it's like I want to go home I think the only other track that I really just kind of fell for a little bit was the song space song where there's actually a really cute kind of boop boop little a keyboard line and there it actually feels like I'm listening to a tune about a little cute baby spaceship or just like little space voyage it's precious and this actually is one of the few moments on this record that I would say where beachhouse takes this space this newfound space as a result of getting rid of that reverb and kind of being more up front being more clear having the instrumentation be more tangible and they actually make use of it with you know some extra keyboard layers that are very pretty and very quaint I wish they did that more often I think beachhouse kind of uh I don't know revealed themselves a little bit as a one-trick pony on this album inadvertently again they stripped out that essential bit of the beach house equation just stripped it away a little bit not even entirely but a little bit and and and as a result I feel like there's so much less majesty here there's some of the there's nothing mysterious about beach house which I guess without really taking it into account was was maybe an appeal of their music that it was so gauzy and it was so hazy that it was sounding like it was from this dream world and coming from this other land and now that everything feels so real and so upfront and so you know clear and unobscured it's just kind of like yeah then we have a closing track on here days of candy which is this album's attempt at giving us kind of a grand satisfying closure and it's not too bad of a track but in context of the song I can't help but think about the rest of the record and just how unsatisfying the album itself is like why such a big finish to such a spotty album and it's not like beach house don't know how to write songs with with decent finishes or just like not cut a song off entirely or not structure an album or just not deliver a solid album they've done it several times over and it just seems like this time they've they've just thrown caution to the wind and they're just like yeah the album's out still a lot of the tunes on here weren't too bad the performances were okay and you know with beach house I feel like even when they're not coming out with a fantastic record there is kind of a baseline of music and songwriting talent here that keeps this album from you know being completely unlikable so this album has at least that going for it and a handful of decent tunes too the issue is that many of them just feel kind of unfinished and bare-bones or in the case of wildflower the the sound of the keys and then the sequence drums are so plain that it just kind of feels like beach house is really missing the the aura the glow that typically makes their songs sound so gorgeous without them while the tunes may be decent the aesthetics not there and I think it's really important I think maybe they underestimated that on this release I'm feeling a strong five to light six on this thing transition have you given the Salamah listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana beach house forever 
QBm3upSqKvw,will you review my mix tape will you review my mix tape will you review my mix tape will you review can God do I look tired to you right now I bet I do because this guy kept me up all night banging on the walls slamming the doors singing and yelling about how I need to review his stupid ass mixtape which I'm gonna do now because if I don't my life will be a living hell for the foreseeable future so before we get into this I want to say from the bottom of my heart I'm sorry I'm very sorry to all of you I'm very sorry that this happened kaljaa chesta is my roommate has been for a while now and I'm a Ratman too don't forget I your ex are you gonna let me do the review just let me do the review I'm doing the review no extra commentary necessary I'm doing the review to be honest I don't really know that much about Cal other than that he's around me a lot and I don't like him and my dislike of him is so strong that over the years that I have known him I have made it a point to never learn anything about him and just involve myself in his personal life as little as possible so unfortunately that has its downsides because that means that he had time to make this where I just wish I was more involved I could have stopped it so this is like a mixtape like a rap mixtape with hip-hop songs on it kind of the title is the new cow lassic sort of like a play on the Iggy Azalea album title which I don't know why you're you're you're ripping her off do you even like her oh I love you please a Lia she got the best raps the best sings super talented I love you give me a cow we'll go out of date I'm pretty sure she's taken like I think she got like engaged recently I think she's she's spoken for oh my dad are you serious oh do such a thing yeah this guy a Nick Young I think I think his name is gates I can't believe you Nick Young you ideally had in that cage that cage this is gonna be so hard beautiful woman better gauge um the intro to this tape is kind of funny features a very very hilarious Instagram user by the name of you ain't packin meat how exactly Cal Church esta knows him I really have no idea but moving on from that we kind of get our first full song of the record hot dinner which is over the the Bobby shmurda beat that big breakout single that he had I'm just honestly I'm just reading off my notes here because I just I really don't care and the Cal essentially raps about eating cooked food on this thing which I mean I guess it's a new topic for the genre and for whatever reason Cal Lake is on this mixtape he's like talking with his ad-libs which is not anything I really ever heard any rapper do like he's having a conversation with them and I don't exactly know how that's even possible you know it's just the a the voice in my head hey I hear all the time so you like your voice and you're in your head all day like where does this voice even come from maybe okay wait don't don't uh don't let that happen again and um well we'll get through the rest of this review alright okay moving on from here we have what kind of sounds like a parody version of what what that I love Makonnen song they're going up on a Tuesday song but Cal is throwing up on a Tuesday I guess because he ate too much candy after Halloween which believe it or not is based off of a true story I do vividly remember the projectile vomiting that Cal was doing last Halloween it's it's something that I'll never forget and it's really the reason that every Halloween from now on I slip a few benadryl zin to cow's breakfast because by the time trick-or-treating comes around he is just sound asleep so yeah the song is about throwing up which I I don't know who does that that does not sound like anything anyone should do well you know things are supposed to be about feelings and that one time I was feeling like throwing up so it made say um after that for whatever reason one of the most popular youtubers right now filthy Frank appears on the remix of the song Coco which Cal heard from that one rapper but he's rapping about cocaine and Cal being as naive as he is thought that he was listening to a song about Coco the drink so that he thought that he would write his own lyrics about it I guess and um it's over a different beat Cal made it it sounds like crap and I mean pink guy is occasionally funny here and there but I mean I don't know why you would want to do a song collaboration with one of the most widely known perverts on the internet it's actually quite disturbing that someone as dumb and as I guess clueless and as innocent as Cal would be fraternizing with people who are very clearly stirred in like a clinical fashion regardless cow manages to bring more complete weirdos onto this tape I don't know what it is about his personality where these freaks of nature just gravitate toward him but apparently there's also this other weird guy who like wears a mask and he's a I don't know just reflective 3d glasses in his vlogs his name is mr. Doody head and Cal has these phone messages which he put onto this mixtape of mr. Doody had trying to get him onto his record label and I have since tried to Google the record label mr. Doody head brings up and these messages doesn't exist so I don't know what kind of fantasy land doodyhead or Cal or this whole mixtape is living in it just seems that every single person on this mixtape including calcio chesta is a completely delusional from hearing voices to thinking that you know like that people who take rap seriously and are in the hip-hop industry are actually like listening to this record and I don't know taking it seriously which is something that Cal even sort of questions and responds to on the song parody it's like he is sort of delusional and brain damaged in some kind of way but he is also conscious of the the real world's opinion of him because on the song he's saying that people are calling me a parody but no rapper compared to me which is kind of a catchy hook I will give that to Cal so on the song parody Cal just kind of I don't know shoots back at people who are calling him just a joke and a parody but I mean you you are fully aware that this is a comedy album right like this is a novelty record oh it's funny and I'm laughing all the way to the bank this mixtape is is free it's just free it's downloadable you're you're not making any money off of this this is this is completely free mixtape this mixtape ain't free it is in fact free there is no price on this tape it's it's a free tape it's free free glazed alien a cage okay um this this is where the tape actually starts the a kind of we have a couple of tracks sadboy be my babe a where cal church esta starts getting so emotional that he doesn't even finish the song like he'll he'll start rapping at the start but then in the midst of the track he'll have an emotional breakdown he'll start crying something will go wrong where I guess his feelings get the better of him and what while I guess it's cool that calc your chest is an emotional performer it keeps him from finishing songs which is not good I guess if if you wanted to hear songs from kouchi chesta after this the album kind of picks up which is good I guess with the song friend from the Apple Store which eases a that numbers on the boards instrumental from one of my favorite Pusha T songs essentially ruins the song honestly but the track is a story which it's interesting that Cal has said something coherent on a track I guess that's new however um I I can't really give this track much in the way of points because uh it's just completely fake it's just a completely fake fabricated story there's nothing real about this story there's nothing you know it's just cow made it up in his head hey there was a true story that happened to me no way this story is true because it starts off with you making a friend and you have no friends well you're my friend Ian thing moving on from this track we have this really weird interview on what radio station I've never heard of but in in the midst of this interview with Cal Church esta where he seems to find two more strange delusional people who just do not live in reality I think Cal is somehow manipulating these people in like a really like strange way maybe even drugging them in order to get them to comply with what he's doing on this record if he is engaged in such activities I have not seen or found proof of it but this mixtape really makes me suspicious and I will be you know sort of looking out for evidence of such wrongdoing in the future but anyway we have a radio host and a Co down here just again giving a bunch of false information Cal is not signed to Metal Blade Records I went on their website verified that that was not true and Cal is not dating Taylor Swift either which has also talked about during this interview I don't really know what is is going on in this interview all I know is that it most likely as well as this entire tape will be used in a court of law if and when that evidence of Cal sort of you know manipulating these people in some kind of nefarious way comes to light so these people that Cal has clearly manipulated to be on this tape then do not like the Freestyle that he performs for them which is odd on the next track because he does a freestyle over the getting jiggy with it beat whether you know it or not Will Smith is one of Cal's greatest influences and idols and he's always bumping them was he's always bumped in well Smith big wheelie style everyday living that big wheelie life and this makes Cal angry which I've never I've never even really seen Cal angry he always just seems like a happy-go-lucky kind of dude but he gets angry on this track he's legitimately angry and frustrated although um he's not very convincing like is is he is he scary is he threatening he's really just kind of goofy which um I mean I don't know that's he doesn't do angry very well I suppose and of course he's doing this over the bitch you guessed it instrumental from og MACO which Mac oh I have enjoyed some of his work in the past and I guess he's somebody else who in in the midst of of reviewing this tape I wanted it really everyone's instrumentals the cow landed on on this tape I want to say sorry like for my from death from deep down I personally want to give an apology from me on behalf of Cal to you he would never say that he thinks he did a good job here but but to everyone whose production is on this mixtape I just want to say sorry I'm sorry this happened to you not exactly a high point in your career I know but but I'm sorry from here Cal's anger sort of drives him into this pit of emotion darkness where he needs his friends to back him up again I don't think how it really has any friends either he brings on people who I think he has manipulated in some way or for whatever reason he's attracting these total weirdos and Internet perverts this mr. doodyhead character filthy Frank and pink guy and now on this final cut over here this I need my friends cut we have Frank jab see who I've enjoyed quite a few of his videos on his YouTube channel before but now I'm starting to think that maybe he has my a bit of a devious side I didn't really account for earlier we have Mr John sackers who is a songwriter vlogger and vegan known for his YouTube channel where not only does he put out one song after another relating to veganism philosophy and a lot of other issues but um maybe he's most known for this one video where he's just really going in about how he likes to a lick vegan vaginas utterly disturbing honestly and then we have three pocket on this track who is like this internet rapper kid who um I I just have no idea why Callen bided him on here hey yeah I'm just taking it back to the old school you know what Shane all right number one you you are from with Wisconsin Minnesota or something you you are not from the west side and and number two three pock you you know that he is you know that he's not Tupac right i daddy was just you know the same guy but like better you know Lee told to his not as much as three so you know three tool yep alright and then from here we get like an original bonus version of the Coco track which um that there's one line on this track where where the line is literally no no no no no no no no which that look great behold your lyrical hero right here with the amazing bars and we get a remix of that same Koko song we needed an another remix of that track but not like a rap remix with a bunch of guest rappers on we have experimental electronic music producer pretty widely known in the vaporwave scene and mesh with a 10 minute long remix of this fucking coco track what's wrong with you and that's essentially this mixtape in a nutshell honestly guys I have to say I'm afraid for our future I really am I'm afraid for our future I'm afraid for our children our children's children and I I don't know I really don't know what it is I'm sort of wondering whether or not this tape is a problem if this tape is the cause of a problem or maybe if it's just a symptom of a deeper issue that even if I were to burn this tape and delete it from the internet and chop up cows body and throw it into a river would I be saving the world from a terrible terrible fate or am I only delaying some kind of you know dark grave awful inevitability I really don't know the answer to that question but this tape does make me curious about that that that but he wanted me to review the tape anyway despite the fact that I pleaded and begged with him to just let me be I'm feeling a light 3 on this tape ok hey everyone so it's the fact of the matter that Antony and me had a conversation and his assessment of

NTyqliFaMbk,oh hey everyone wall ffunny not Tanna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a sweaty review of the new ghost record meliora what are you doing abilities album titles oh a ghost is a Swedish rock and metal band and this is their third full-length LP and they're actually one of the most hyped and I think elaborate bands to come out of metal music in a while not just because of their really fantastic stage show that they put on when they play live which I have had the pleasure to see but also because of their sound if you listen to a ghost record you're most likely going to get some some pretty awesome very melodic well written and very strong song backed metal music with a bit of an old-school flavor something that sounds like it's coming out of like the late 60s or the 70s and especially on their debut LP while there were some cheesy moments on this album again it was just too fantastically written and catchy to just outright dismiss it that was until their their sophomore record which just really did not measure up in my opinion and the opinion of many other people as well so it was a bit of a polarizing release for the band and I respect this album as a big moment for ghosts I mean along with this record came a big US tour an endorsement from none other than Dave Grohl as well as just a larger production sound and recording but the band's instrumentation on this record I started to sound like sanitized to death to the point where just there was no grit left in ghosts sound the eeriness and the danger that was there on the debut was no longer on this record not that the first album is super duper dangerous I mean it's very theatrical it's very campy but I think the camp really just kind of took over in a really unrewarding way on the sophomore record and the vocals didn't really do it for me on this album either and I think some of ghosts most subpar songs landed on this project but I think maybe this could be partially due to the fact the band was switching singers around this time from what I understand they are on their third papa mmm urges this is the band constantly swishing out one singer after another is this merely just some kind of weird costume change so that ghosts can continue to build up just the mystery around the band I I truly and honestly have no idea all I know is that the vocals on the sophomore record were just a little weird and nasal in my opinion just everything that I liked about ghost on their debut just turn slightly sour on this record so of course on this latest full-length LP from ghost they are trying once again to bring a larger instrumental presentation while simultaneously bringing good songs and by Jove I think they've done it everyone is cringing right now cringing so hard the Harmonized guitar leads there's a moment on this record where harp pops in Hopson Hopson Hopson Hopson Hopson the huge choral vocals on this record as well as the booming drums and the keyboards and the acoustic guitar when it does pop up all sound gorgeous they all come together and they layer in this wonderful way they are glistening in this very punchy mix I would actually say there are numerous moments on this album that that I would say ghosts instrumental arrangements are actually really elegant and detailed and again just really well assembled and the drums and the rhythm guitars on here actually have the kind of punch that I wanted to hear on the sophomore record they have a bit more bite yeah this record is very cleanly produced it is very uh it's it's definitely not a mechanical album it's not a rigid album but you know the guitars definitely sound a little uh ensnared they're not wild or anything like that they are very steady they keep the rhythm they keep the tempo on this album that there isn't anything you know super aggressive about ghosts on this album but they are bringing well-written songs with good sounds and good mixes and I'm liking the vocals once again on this record to the new Pappa very melodic very eerie and stylistically ghost continues to pulled from that old school of rock and metal music and I think they diversify their influences a little bit they're not only just pulling from from thrash and just older bands like Blue Oyster Cult or something like that I think there's a little bit of classical music worked into here there's also a bit of heavy psyche worked into here and what sounds like a bit of just old-school pop rock as well as progressive rock - overall this album just sounds really cinematic how it shifts from one musical style an idea to the next while it continues to just bring these lush heavy massive instrumental presentations and to sort of show the diversity of this record you might even want to jump to the song key is while you're listening to this LP it kicks off with this a little acoustic interlude and it's a very tender moment on the record but it eventually just kicks up a notch into this very grand epic hulking ballad there are moments of the song that are like pure King Crimson pure Pink Floyd and yes and not only does go show this dynamic range from track to track on this LP but they show this range within single songs as well just like the opening track here spirit which is easily one of the most dynamic songs they've ever written really huge crescendos on this track I love how the song ends the ascending instrumental passages in the second half of this track are killer and just some of the most elaborate stuff ghost has ever delivered thus far and I think they just really executed it just executed it really well and the way the track kicks off with some nice driving rhythm guitars and these kind of Cryptkeeper since that sort of set the tone right at the beginning of the track it's just a well assembled tune and we transition from this track into a moment from the pinnacle to the pit where ghost gets grimy right from the get-go with this distorted bassline that continues throughout much of the track and I love the the very resonant the ringing guitar lead that calls out over this bass line just like some really sinister in some respects it sounds like this track the song on this track could have landed on ghost debut record which might be disappointing for some people who are going into this album looking for something something totally new from ghost and I don't really think this album provides that it doesn't really provide a huge change of pace as much as it shows ghost very effectively fine-tuning the sound that made us so excited in 2010 on this record I felt like I was still getting the same ghost that I got five years ago but this time the song structures and the writing are just longer they're more elaborate they're more ambitious on top of that I'm getting just more instrumentation heavier production it's kind of the record that I wish the sophomore album had been but you know it doesn't always work out that way regardless though I love how the second half of this track sounds totally different from the first another testament to go songwriting on this record and I also love some of the transitions on the song cirse from the riff on this track to the glistening pianos that we kind of get on the pre-chorus a little bit and then maybe around like the 330 minute mark of the track the way that all the instrumentation goes silent and then you get that lone vocal and then all of a sudden all the instrumentation busts into this just it just blossoms it explodes into this melodic beautiful rock and metal it's almost operatic in a sense presentation I just love that transition just so many good transitions on this album transition once again there are a few other cuts in the tracklist in here that actually read to me like 2010 ghost but again just on a bigger cooler awesome or more exciting grander scale like the song mummy dust which is maybe one of the dorkiest songs in the track listing here in terms of the lyrics but I still love the track and I love the guitar riff on this cut as well especially the tone on this guitar riff reminds me of something like often anthrax record and I love how Ghost continues to to blatantly reference these thrash metal riffs and these thrash metal bands but work these riffs and work these ideas into such beautiful and creepy songs even the start of the song absolutions you know to me reminiscent of like some Metallica For Whom the Bell Tolls intro the song majesty as well is kind of another throwback for me for ghost it just kind of reminds me of a like an older song from them although maybe it's not too advanced far past what ghost was doing all the way back then and it does it's it's not like a low low point for me on the record but it is a moment where I'm just kind of like yeah yeah I mean you could you could have tried harder to make this bigger still even on this track and many other cuts here ghost just hits the nail on the head one time after another it just sounds like they were very well aware of the mixed reception of the last record and they pretty much overcame every hump and smoothed out every wrinkle from that past experience and just brought us a fresh awesome well prepared sound on the lyrical end of things I'm enjoying this record - I think ghost continues to be very blasphemous as well as devilish and poetic and this closing track even though I don't really like some of the theatrical riffs on on this song I still kind of enjoy ghosts camp especially how you kind of hear this metronome ticking away in the midst of the silence between these huge thunderous drums and guitars and keys I like those little extra sounds and and bits of sound play that ghost works in to not only create good songs but you know just like some really creepy vivid strange occult imagery that surrounds these songs as well so this was a really enjoyable record for me this was a really exciting record for me because I feel like ghost was finally able to create that sonic that musical world that they look like they come from onstage it wasn't quite fully realized on their debut but the songs were great so you know it's not really a huge detriment to that record that it doesn't have a fully formed aesthetic around it but I think on this record we get great songs and we get that style we get that strong sense of style I think ghost really does come into their own on this record and provide us with again that musical world that we imagined them coming from and they fully form that they fully created it and they've allowed us to come into it I think up until this point this world that they present on this record was just an idea and now this world exists it's actually here and the representation of it is this album I'm feeling a strongly too light 9 on this thing transition have you given this record to listen if you have what do you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantino ghost really good it out why go forever 
iphA405OvIU,Oh hi everyone test with a cram tan I'm here the Internet's busiest music nerd and let's do a review of the new mick jenkins EP waves Mick Jenkins is a Chicago rapper who came out with a breakout project last year I believe that I thought was pretty great the waters Mick is a wordy a thoughtful rapper who uses a lot of symbolism on that tape having to do with water and thirst and hydration a little bit of ginger ale on the side as well and a lot of these things symbolize what I could gather sort of enlightenment knowledge awareness after the release of this tape mcdhh f initely became an artist to watch within a few months time however even though he has a ton of hype he is still a new artist who has just come out with his breakout project he's not signed to like a major label I believe so you know he's kind of in a vulnerable state right now he needs to follow the waters up with a great project that impresses people just as much and I I think in a way he's kind of putting that inevitability of a new album off by coming out with this EP here this mini album which is very similarly titled to its predecessor and is a bit of I think a philosophical extension of the last record Mick does circle around a lot of the same themes he does incorporate a lot of the same lyrical imagery though I think maybe he dabbles a little bit more and loved on this EP than he did on his previous project so don't expect anything too novel on the lyrical front with this project though the lyrics are still good Mick is still putting in quite a bit of effort in his verses and he does come through with some clever and some symbolic lines on waves too but this project where it really surprises and and sometimes impresses sometimes fails to impress is in its sound this project sounds way different from waters this project doesn't really sound like you're underwater like the last one did this one is not really as woozy or as subtle or as intoxicating and just low-key and relaxed this EP here is much brighter much louder again not much like being submerged underwater but actually being on top of the water on a ship in the midst of unpredictable stormy weather or kind of like rising ocean waters violently crashing against a rocky shore this EP hits hard right from the start with the track alchemy which features this kind of cloudy trap flavor beat and Mick on top of this instrumental is delivering his lines with a ton of conviction although I wish he had been as persistent with his bars in the second half of this track which sort of seems to fall off and just does not deliver as much intensity as the first half although he does kind of take this time to address the confusion that some fans had with last project over water to derail and there are actually a few other cuts on here that feel similar to me like they have sort of fizzled endings or they just kind of end abruptly like the song piano or the track get up get down and to sort of bring it back to that whole unpredictability thing Mick then starts working in these tracks that are kind of singsong he actually features quite a bit of singing from him or Mick brings a vocal guest on to one of these tracks to sing like on the song slumbers which it does kind of feature some weak background vocals but I love the jazzy instrumental on this track and the really intense drumming throughout this song too and again with the song get up get down this track is really peppy even though I didn't really love the ending of this song it kind of felt like Mick was trying to write a bit of a hit here and if Mick's intentions of accessibility on this EP aren't clear enough for you on that track then give it a listen to the song your love which is actually a pretty sweet sugary song as shamelessly sweet and just very lovey-dovey although I like this track I think the Bee is really sensual I think overall the song is a is well-written and memorable and I think Mick's flow on the track is deep husky voice sounds amazing like his voice was made for this kind of song but the singing on the song is way too goofy and way too clumsy to pull this track outside of the immediate fanbase that that Mick has which is a bit of a shame because again I think the song is well written to the point where if it had a stronger singer on it and Mick just sucked a rapping on this track it could be a legitimate hit for him and again on the song 40-below I mean Mick is really kind of going like 808s and heartbreak on this EP at points but again I think if he's gonna try to do this stuff on a bigger project he's really got to clean up and groom these choruses and clean up and groom these singing voices or else his next album is gonna sound like a mess given that he actually wants to incorporate any of this stuff on his next album this EP might just be like a really weird detour which is why he put out an EP as opposed to an album but then again it's kind of hard to feel that way given that this is so closely titled to the waters maybe this is all the leftover stuff from Watters who knows I really have no idea all I know is that I hear potential here I do I really do and there are some great tracks on here as well especially the last two cuts P's and Q's and The Closer these are two of the few tracks on this project that actually feature consistently Mick rapping from pretty much beginning to end and his verses actually just kill one after another on these tracks this is the fantastic just just very intense and very passionate makjang khun's that I loved from the waters just translating again here over some more upbeat instrumental overall I liked this thing but again that potential that I said is there not all of it is capitalized on especially with some of the singing voices being so clumsy and messy here and especially with some of these songs feeling like the first half is very well put together very well written but the second half is a bit of a dud like you know the song wasn't fully fleshed out into the fully capable track that it could have been I'm feeling a like decent six on this thing Tran you 
sOt6TERBG-g,hi everyone Donald out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new health record death magic health is a California noise rock outfit that blew up the blogosphere in the late 2000s with some fantastic tracks off of their debut full-length LP it was an ear-piercing debut record that even impressed the likes of mr. Trent Reznor himself and the record had this really cool combination of just abrasive sounds but it also had like this sweet side to it that the band ended up embracing a little bit more on their next full-length LP get color where they actually came through with some of their catchiest pop influenced singles yet songs like die slow the single USA boys actually came out around this time too but still even though get color did have some catchy er songs on it these accessible tracks as well as the more abrasive tracks on the record we're all topped with these really Airy just cold disembodied vocals that have kind of since then become a like a trademark for four Health's sound and since that record health is indulged in some other projects as well as like sound tracking which is actually really cool but still I've been waiting for a record from these guys for a while because they inhabit or really interesting crossroads between pop music and electronic music and dance music and noise and noise rock and experimental rock it's an unlikely combination of influences and and yet death magic ends up sounding so bland on Death Magic health does manage to pull together some heavy and massive walls of digital mayhem especially on tracks like men today but songs like men today are often the really chaotic exception on this album these tracks are usually the shortest on the record and at the end of the day just really end up sounding like these little detours to kind of counterbalance what the bulk of this album is and that is these kind of really moody indie tronic dance toons that's the bulk of this album the kind of stuff that I think would have blown Minds more if this had come out around the time that like Crystal Castles debut had dropped which is kind of an understandable sound and influence for health to have I mean they have collaborated with Crystal Castles before in the past but still regardless I think essentially what that's kind of communicating to me is that it's been almost 10 years since the release of Crystal Castles first album and they almost have like nothing in terms of a new idea I've always thought health has had some really cool and intriguing noisy and abrasive ideas that work themselves into their records but on Death Magic these noisy ideas these sonic experiments usually sort of play second fiddle to these dance pop tunes and these songs are often kind of dreamy high gloss and and top with these really lifeless vocals and there isn't really that much in the way of sonic experimentation on a lot of tracks here like the really sugary song life which actually I think could have been a b-side off of like an m83 record or at least like a Passion Pit record that song again is it's sugary it's shamelessly sugary there's also the song dark enough as well as flesh world UK which just kind of sound like modern conventional dance tunes with the occasional shot of feedback worked into the beat just to make it sound a little edgy and if that doesn't convince you of this records edginess then you just got to listen into some of the lyrics I mean some of the lyrics on this record are apathetic and just unplugged from a care in the world maybe even a little nihilistic at points I mean you just get a load of some of these song titles I mean hurt yourself drugs exist there are some tracks on here that find I think a better and a healthier and a more interesting balance between these dance tunes and the more abrasive side of health tracks like New Coke and stone fist I think probably my two favorite songs on the entire record so these tracks are kind of the middle ground on this record and then there are the other songs that bring on these heaps of noise like men today that I mentioned or the song salvia and these tracks are just structured as if health didn't even care about these songs as if they just kind of accepted that they were going to be these uninteresting detours that didn't really do anything but just provide a buffer between each attempt at a dance hit on this album just unnecessarily padding the record out and it's not like health can't structure a song there are numerous songs with pop song structures on here they could have at least taken the time to do something interesting with these more abstract tracks as they were breaking away from that aibee aibee structure instead these weirder songs just kind of feel like bridges to nowhere even if you like the poppier dance your tracks on this record these more abstract numbers just don't really add much of anything except again an attempt at a counterbalance to these catchy er moments which I don't understand why you need that I mean if that's the direction you want to go in just go in that direction no need to come up with these just unmemorable detours to make us think that the record is way grittier than it actually is but even with these poppier tracks even with these dance your tracks I mean a lot of the beats may have a lot of punching to them I think health comes through with some good production but there's really not much here in terms of like a song or a tune that I'm really gravitating toward and the the sugary sugary songs in the track listing here especially on the second half are a huge turnoff for me on this record health essentially tries to saunter into the world of dance pop without you know like a solid song without memorable lyrics and sometimes I feel like the the cold fish vocals that health usually brings to the table that that fit in pretty nicely with their more abrasive cuts on their previous two LPs just feel a little out of place on top of tracks like life for example and these vocals get kind of old kind of fast especially when you consider how much longer this album is then Health's previous output I mean 40 minutes over here their debut record didn't even top unfortunately I'm kind of indifferent to this record wasn't really digging it and there were some tracks on here that are pretty much some of my least favorite health songs so far in their career I mean I could see what they're trying to do with this record and I think some people are gonna like the the more danceable direction they've gone in with this project I just don't really care for much of any of it I'm feeling a strong for two like five on this thing transition have you given this record of listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it more than me hopefully you did and that's it and then you know what did you think of this thing love you Anthony Fantan Oh health death magic forever 
Sn9tZQPLxaE,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's ichiya snooze ik nerd and it's time for review of new fka twigs EP melissa yeah fka twigs is a uk-based singer songwriter dancer artist of multiple mediums in my opinion really one of the most intriguing artists out of there I now fight it fight it she came through with some pretty interesting musical ideas on her initial EPS and some of these tracks while they were really intriguing they were also kind of short of breath but on her debut LP which dropped not too long ago you should really give it a listen LP one and she complimented these really abstract approaches to art pop and arm B and trip-hop with some really great songs she was somehow able to make her music catchy ur more accessible while also maintaining this very abstract outward appearance and a lot of the tracks on this record were quite erotic as well I just loved the really odd digital atmospheres on this record and the kind of alluring songs and the just slow-burning vibe of this record and the kind of sexual lyrics here I was really excited to sort of see where fka twigs was going to develop this sound on subsequent releases and now all of a sudden out of the blue we have the release of this brand-new EP titled Melissa Melissa and it's a five track affair but we have built up to the release of this EP with two songs that were put out previously the song figure 8 which was released not too long ago as a single and then we have the song glass and patron which was released as a track slash music video during the YouTube Music Awards earlier this year and it was kind of complemented with this somewhat messy gaudy music video that I think distracted away from just how good this song actually is to go through these tracks so in figure 8 I thought sort of a conceptually wasn't really anything too new for twigs but it did have some kind of strange sounds and experiments laced into the instrumental you're the kind of twittering sputtering glitchy percussion playing throughout this track and the kind of moaning bass the heavy walls of digital fuzz on this track were a really nice touch too and there's some strange like spoken-word passages in the second half again twigs does take some risks sonic risks on this track that I thought were cool it's a decent song I just wish it had a strong ending really an ending at all it just kind of just finishes abruptly out of nowhere but the following cut I'm your doll is actually maybe my favorite song on here and one of the better written songs fka twigs has to date really catchy and on the highly sexual lyrics on this track twigs is sounding really vulnerable and I love how the instrumental on this cut just grows to a massive size toward the end of the track it's a heavy woozy sexy and memorable song the songs in time and glass and patron though kind of break this EP streak thus far of coming through with these tracks that just have a very soft touch these two songs tracks three and four are actually way more direct I would actually say on the lyrics and just her singing as well on the song in time twigs comes off pretty frustrated which is the first time I've heard her kind of take that tone in a song and actually like it I think this track goes over really well especially with the instrumental here which has a slight trap flavor but of course even though the twittering high hats are here and then the huge base the whole instrumental itself is very out there there's this weird auto-tune or sort of chorus effect on Twiggs voice on a lot of parts of this track that's really ear grabbing but it is tasteful it's it's not like goofy or or ridiculous or anything like that the song in a way it actually reminds me of a Travis Scott if he back to his experiments with actually good songs and interesting ideas and the song glass and patron the the the sped up vocals on this track how they feel did that it reminds me a little bit of PC music their production style but ultimately this is an entirely different kind of song with a really weird dance groove under the where we have twigs sort of reciting this very whispery line pose for me it's like a Madonna vogue for like a new era the instrumental on this cut really sounds like it's coming from another dimension or like a dance club where no one is dancing because everybody is like too weird or pretentious or something but but altogether it is still a really enjoyable song and the the closing track on here 'mother creak creak creak creak is actually a very well written track as well and has a few catchy refrains worked into another instrumental that it just seems like the further I go into this record the weird off-kilter minimalist approach taking on these beats gets weirder and weirder and weirder I really loved this EP I thought it was killer fka twigs really came through with a good a good release on this one not that LP one wasn't good but I feel like she she took that songwriting ability and she translated it to an EP like I said her earlier EPS I think she surpassed those with this new EP over here mostly because yeah the abstract ideas are here just like on those EPS but there's also some good songs in the track listing here as well and I think she's just continuing to develop her sound and do strange things with it I don't think these tracks are as conventional as a lot of the cuts off of LP one maybe that'll turn off some people but the listeners who really appreciate twigs for her abstract ideas her erotic lyrics and her great singing voice will appreciate what she has to to bring to the table on a Melissa I'm feeling a strong a to a line 9 on this thing transition have you given the starter to listen if you have what do you think of it do you love it do you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana fka twigs Melissa 
0dc-pNv6gwA,only who's not there Lana Del Rey if Lana Del Rey is there you don't want to get high by the beach you want to be as sober as possible if you're around Lana Del Rey yeah good good choice good life choices that's why we're together love you hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new cattle decapitation record goddamn this title this thing the Anthropocene extinction wanted to sort of semi pronounce that correctly cattle decapitation is a California deaf grind outfit and this is like their sixth record and for a while they've been a band that I've kind of just admired from afar but I've never really been super into I typically love the apocalyptic visuals of their records especially how they sort of you know show humans being eaten or slaughtered or sort of treated in the same way that humans unfairly treat animals what up consider veganism the band's music has also featured this stellar level of aggression and ferocity and cattle decapitation right now also has one of the best vocalists in the metal game Travis Ryan I actually liked his vocals quite a bit on that murder construct record that came out a little while back not quite a Gore grind record but pretty interesting and awesome and just cutthroat in deadly fusion of death metal and grind core on this album and I've also enjoyed that cattle decapitation is a little more versatile than most of the groups in their genre partially because of Travis Ryan's vocals he not only has these incredible animalistic screams and just guttural growls but he can also slip into some very nice melodic vocals as well however not not the type of singing that is a super corny or melodramatic or his singing voice maintains this really weird high-pitched rasp that leaves him singing like some kind of mutant troll like from a deep dark cave where no light is ever shining for a while I've thought that there's a lot to like about cattle decapitation and even though I've never reviewed them or said hey this is this bans great you know I've seen why they're popular I've seen their appeal but there have been some things that have really held me back from liking them for one their earliest releases I think are a little kind of cliche for the gore grind genre and then for the bigger more breakout records in their catalogue the very sanitized clean just ultra perfect and flawless production styles on this record just kind of leave me cold with just all the flawless guitars and the just very punchy trigger drums it just leaves me feeling like I'm not even listening to a band in seeking that really perfect production sound I think a lot of character tends to get sapped out of the performances and just the sound of the instruments too however I don't think that is as much the case on their new record over here which i think is much chunkier heavier bass ear even though that very tight flawless production remains that does leave cattle decapitation feeling sounding a little mechanical the band does make sure to incorporate just more heavy groovy mosh friendly riffs some slower more melodic guitar passages and some legitimately catchy hooks where those raspy melodic vocals sort of end up soaring over the mayhem with the guitars and the drums happening below I think camel decapitation is sounding just a little bit more organic on this record and and not to say that you know they've gone Lofa or analog or anything like that I mean this is still a very digital recording but it does have I think of a bit more of a human touch to it which does leave this album sounding listenable for me but not like listenable in a pleasant way like this is an easy metal record to listen to this is still an extreme fucking metal record with just blast beats galore it's a gruesome record it's a fucking brutal record dude it's fucking brutal it's a style and it's a metal aesthetic that is really unforgiving it's relentless and even though camel decapitation has a kind of unwelcoming sound on this record that doesn't mean that there aren't good ideas here man because there are some really fiery melodic guitar solos on this thing that are super impressive especially on the song clandestine waise which has one of the better sort of guitar spotlights on the entire record those raspy melodic vocals man they come in and they provide just like the right amount of just ooh that just that part is really freaking pops there's so many bang and riffs on this thing and just the winding twisted song structures on these tracks are awesome as well and leave a lot of these songs feeling like an onion and I'm just with each listen just peeling back one layer after another the layers of guitars and drums and vocals on this thing they may feel really squeezed and compartmentalized and and edited and just very very heavily groomed and I do usually like my death metal a little bit more blood caked and gruesome I like it to sound like just a really gory be horror movie but you know I can be swung over to the other side of the fence with this record I mean you know it's it's it's like watching Evil Dead versus like the Saw series or like you know some 2000s era West craving or something like that just some high budget super high gloss shit the song burden of seven billion on this record is actually a bit of an interlude in the middle of this record kind of a breather and it sounds like something that would that would do an amazing job of like sound tracking a horror movie trailer and the title of that track as well as the title of this record I I do want to mention is delivering a theme that is sort of about the the point at which the ecosystem of the earth is altered by human interaction by human existence to the point where the earth no longer sustains human life hence the sort of corpses all over the cover here and that theme that message plays out in a pretty strong way in some of the lyrics on this record especially on the track following that interlude mammals in Babylon where the lyrics are actually a pretty awesome so listening to this album forcing myself to just really listen to it over and over and over I've come to appreciate and sort of understand a little bit better what cattle decapitation is all about and and I like their style I like their aesthetic of again I've appreciated it from afar but what keeps me coming back to this record is that the writing is good despite cattle the cap Haitians very extreme sound there are some pretty well written songs here not that I think they'll necessarily translate perfectly to like acoustic guitars and pianos or anything like that but I think there are tracks on this record that are legitimately catchy and these songs don't just sound like this random barrage and an onslaught of ugly guitars and blast beats and and and all that like the riffs and the swirling whirlwinds of drums and just a very fast strum guitars that I get caught up in like they're freakin tornado these parts come together really well and create a lot of tension and then once those melodic bits come in once those slower just guitar passages pop in you're getting a lot of release and it's it's a really cool roller coaster ride that a lot of these songs present and cattle decapitation finds great balance between those more intense spots between those more melodic spots on pretty much every track here this record is is a really good mix of being visceral and aggressive but also just memorable and and and catchy too it's super brutal but there's a lot of finite detail to that brutality as well now even though I like this record I think it's fantastic and I'm gonna be slapping it with a very positive score at the end of this review it does not come without you know sort of it's picky complaints from me it is slightly one-dimensional and I do think as a result of that not that any one part of the record suffers other than the end here I think the closing track the entire record is so freakin extreme how exactly do you come out with like a big finale for for the last song here I I think the last song doesn't really close out the record that well especially with the fade-out at the very end even though cattle decapitation does try to build up to that moment with the preceding track which is a bit of a very ominous gloomy acoustic interlude and then all of a sudden you're getting this really ferocious track in your face kind of making it feel like you've had this breather there making the song feel even more explosive but really the only thing to me that makes this song all that much different from any other track in the tracklisting here is that maybe it has the longest set of melodic vocal passages on the entire record which were nice which went over well but it wasn't enough for me to be like ah this this is the closer here this is the grand finale I feel like this song could have been worked in at many different points earlier on the record and it would have been fine so yeah this record can be slightly one-dimensional but for a gourd rind record I do think the vocals that Travis Ryan brings to the table and the guitars do provide enough versatility to make this album enjoyable and listenable even as it passes by the 40-minute mark and there's also again the fact that sometimes those sung vocals do make me giggle a little bit they sound cartoonish at points especially when they're singing these really melodramatic vocals like how and occasionally I feel like the way the the instruments are edited to sound so unbelievably freakin flawless and tight sometimes can be a little distracting to me from the song but that could be something that I just slowly get over with with more lessons yeah I mean I I again I appreciate the band's aesthetic I think the songs are written well I think the guitar sound great the drums are just you know a flurry they're just super intense they're just relentless and was super impressed with the vocals on most of these tracks too I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this thing Tran position have you given this record of listen if you love it did you I would hope you're doing well Anthony Fantino cattle the kappa fuckin tation forever 
ndr2MYXIfAk,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a vital update where I tell all y'all a bunch of records that have made their way into the sacred vinyl case back here um it's it's we're starting to run out of room here honestly might need to get another shelf might need to get another thing over here we're running out of space hmm picked up some records alright you know let's let's just get straight into it right off the top I want to thank our sponsor of this video the good people over it finally please the monthly vinyl delivery service where they send you exclusive pressings of fantastic records with a little bit of Albemarle and description and all that stuff and thanks to them thanks to finally please I now own two copies of my favorite dub record the up setters super 8 as you may remember from a previous vinyl video this is my copy of the upset or super 8 and it is a heavy double LP pressing which comes with a little poster actually it's a huge poster which I have not put up haven't had the heart to put up and the coolest thing about this pressing is that on the D side of it there is an awesome fetching of the super 8 eight fantastic dub record again here the upset our super 8 with the Lee scratch Perry on production which is you know why the record sounds the way it does which is why this is a great dub record now that is the copy if you've watched previous vinyl videos you're already familiar with this new copy over here it's actually a 1 LP copy it is not a double LP copy however it is in fact a a green copy sort of like a aqua green it's it's its greenish it looks a green here looking at in the camera this little bluish but yeah it's a green copy over here and it actually comes with some pretty cool little cool insert with like the the super ape shape on there Wow Wow guys and also a nice cool bit of 12-inch art sometimes the art that they pass along is really good I think I think this is my second favorite easily my favorite piece of art that these guys sent along with the record was the the 12 by 12 inch print that they sent along with J Dilla's doughnuts that one was really good fun little donut on that uh wearing like a hat and looking all cool there we go so two copies of the upsetter super 8 because that's you know I just got so many problems you know so many problems just got so many problems to deal with two copies of the upset are super ape life is just hard guys life is hard it's hard it's hard out here for a nerd hey what what what what what is what is what is a man to do what is a man to do alright moving on what's up let's let's do another double here regional recently purchased this scientist he produced this over at a King Tubby studio it says here on the credits scientist meets the space invaders I already own a scientist record and that record is rids the world of the curse of the vampires this record doesn't seem to be as vocally driven [Music] actually I think tune wise this record is not as good but the production I think is a little better the bass on this thing the bass on this record is massive massive bass on this record loving the bass and loving the atmosphere on this record if you're looking to get into dub reggae there's two records right here try out these records or try out these two artists the up setters Lee scratch Perry scientist King Tubby as well looking to get into dub those aren't bad places to start it also picked up a few Devo records you guys on the Devo fan and I am building up the Devo vinyl collection building it up have their first two records on vinyl and now I have their third record on vinyl don't like this record as much as I like their debut but as some of their biggest hits on it girl you want whip-it and some other great songs too so you know can't go wrong with that and I cannot wait to lay this on to the turntable and listen to it all the way through I just sort of peruse the hits on here because I just got it and I wanted to put it in this vinyl video however I have given the single of there's a full listen to the song peekaboo this is a crazy single this is a manic single it's pretty hilarious I love how Devo not only comes with just catchy songs awesome grooves and instrumentals but you know just serious sense of humor as well again which is why DeVos one of my easily on my favorite groups of the 80s peekaboo single we have the dance velocity version of the song on the a side then we have the peekaboo Depot dub on the B side along with Kia song find out nice little 40 40 12-inch play 45 so that's pretty cool I have another 12-inch over here little maxi single of a fantastic Jesus and Mary Chain Saw on April skies this one was really awesome this one sounded great although the who do you love track on the b-side was really a suspect however kill Surf City that was a fun song but the a side April skies one of their best songs and really catchy tune really heavy love the Jesus and Mary Chain sound you know pretty pretty straightforward you know this this record just like what the Devo record just kind of comes with a plastic sleeve fairly simple straightforward packaging it's just a single so you know they're not going all out for it and got this thing for just four bucks that's a great grab that is a great grab right there I picked this thing up a while ago but didn't listen to it didn't give it a full listen until recently so you know I didn't want to talk about it until I did that the doors la woman well one of their more popular records but I think it's sort of infamous for the fact that it is the last record they did with Jim Morrison and then they sort of tried to put out music after his untimely death and it was not very well received you know even in retrospect people do not like those records and I I wouldn't say I this was one of my favorite doors records though I don't think it's bad I mean it has some of their best songs on it but you know but but but some of the more popular songs on here like la woman and like love her madly they don't really give you an idea or a real sense of the doors at this time in their career you know very close to the end of Jim Morrison's life because on this record Jim Morrison sounds absolutely insane like he sounds like a man unhinged and it's kind of freaky it's kind of scary a lot of the tunes aren't bad and and in a way Jim Morrison's kind of animalistic approach on this record is entertaining but it's kind of eerie sort of knowing the the fate that would befall him not too long after this album it comes with sort of this plastic you know like silhouette of the band over here and just kind of get a straightforward yellow sleeve for the record itself and yeah it's a so Jim Morrison sounding incredibly unhinged on this record but also it is like a one of their blue Zia Strecker - and they're kind of on doing these weird blues jams with some pretty prominent bass as well and yeah it's it's it's a strange record for the doors man it is a strange record for the doors while I like it I wouldn't recommend it for anybody who isn't already a doors fan I I would say acclimate yourself to their earlier records before you jump into LA woman from front to back anyway you know no reason to avoid the hits off of this record but yeah an interesting record from a from the doors yeah you're gonna be turning that record over and over in my head for a while did a little exclusive kind of early access classic review for this record recently you will see this record turning up in a future classics week segment on the main channel here yes is closer to the edge amazing progressive rock record nice little old-school gatefold love that image that mural is beautiful and yeah if you're looking to get into some classic progressive rock you can't really go wrong with this record it's pretty easy listen not only other songs fantastic and the production is great but um but you know one thing that I think set sets yes apart from a lot of other progressive rock artists is that they have a real pop sensibility and there's a strong sense of songwriting on this record and some really catchy sweet harmonized vocals too so you know this is progressive rock that you know isn't super artsy fartsy difficult to sit through or anything like that you know it's just some really good straightforward rock music that is very catchy but also has some really awesome and ambitious guitar passages and instrumental builds and and and multifaceted songs so yeah yes closer to the edge picked it up for a few bucks on the vinyl couldn't go wrong on that also ordered this kind of because uh I knew that these guys had a new album out I just reviewed it and I wanted to pick this up because you know I just realized and thought like man I just I liked this record so much I want to own it great babies crusher and still left over I guess there were some pressings from the original run where they sort of did a little exclusive read pressing of the records so it's pretty awesome I was able to get a hold of that when I ordered this record off of hardly art got a lyric sheet here which once I listened to this record I will be reading along with since the lyrics the words the vocals are so strange and bellowing and sneeze yeah crisis averted very creepy bloody album art on the other side grave babies spelled in I don't know what blood jam I can't really tell at this point and also bought a vinyl copy of the new Billy woods album today I wrote nothing corners bent Billy yell at the goddamn post office for bending your freaking records but you might not recognize it because the cover art is totally different and I actually like the cover are on here more than I do on the digital version or the CD version if the same cover art is on the CD version of this album I think this is a really weird ominous creepy cover are I look at this and I'm like what is that is that like some really like amazing post-rock or something but no it's like a really esoteric hip-hop album with some cool short story like songs if you haven't given this album a listen check out my review earlier this year Billy woods today I wrote nothing it is a really good album and I like you know just like they're really desolate look of the photography here really cool sort of uh I guess personal shot there the desk and the cat like a you know sort of a shore situation over there the the cover art is ominous and I like that and the vinyl itself is double LP and it's clear little off-white little beige-ish not not totally clear but but still cool cool clear vinyl awesome awesome glad I picked this up glad I supported Billy on this new record because I did buy a copy of a history will absolve me but I didn't buy a copy of his last record our candy and I figured that I would support him on this one since he was doing this cool double LP to records on here as I already said both clear on this package I thought it was sort of ambitious that he was pulling that together so I decided to pick this up and finally one more record that recently got added to the collection if I could just get this record in the sleeve we're going we're going we're gone finally a copy of the fantastic Nico record this is a Belgian pressing over here Nico record the marble index now not only is this like a Belgian pressing from everything that I can read on the liner notes of the record and it was also listed on the front of the record but it is also Lily this record came out in late 60s I believe and some of you through Wes Anderson's films or through the Velvet Underground may be familiar with her music songs like these days and and just that album the Chelsea girl her debut full-length LP but this album is a totally different turn do not go into this record like expecting beautiful warm embracing lovely little ballets this is a tortured twisted like avant Fulke record this record is like proto goth this is a dark freakin album this is an off-putting album this is an unsettling album and I like that Nico did this record I like that she did this with her producers John Cale did some of the arrangements on this record Fraser Mohawk producer on this record I like that she took this dark artsy weird turn on this record I knew going into this album this was you know like one of her darkest releases and it's it's really intriguing and I'm looking forward to kind of spending time getting more acclimated with it I've been giving the the a side a deep listen and again it is a strange off-putting record it's very unforgiving and run time wise there's not much to it either the the B side seems to be about maybe like ten minutes long and the the a side is uh seems to be pretty short as well it's a brief record but it's got just a lot of emotional twists and turns to it you know again dark record and those are pretty much all the records that I have picked up recently now I'm thinking about doing something different with the next vinyl video I am in fact thinking about taking a trip down to the very bottom over here of my record shelf and getting into some of the ten inches and seven inches that I have in fact really just going through all the seven inches that I have and maybe just like a couple videos and if you're interested in that if you if you think that would be cool leave a comment let me know and we'll do a video where we talk about where we talk about my seven inches anthony Fantana vinyl music transition vinyl vinyl vinyl hope you're having a nice day and believe in yourself all the time anthony Fantana music forever 
b3wTyu80eVM,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Grave baby's album holographic violence grey babies are a Seattle rock band that took me by surprise a few years ago with the album crusher while I didn't love this record at the time that I initially heard it it was so weird that I just couldn't like say nothing about it and if you give this album a listen you're essentially gonna be getting some drum machine back goth rock that is solo Phi on some tracks that it hurts and on top of these instrumentals you're getting these really odd vocals these loud doubled deep bellowing vocals like the idea that these vocals were like coming out of a human is just strange because they just sounds so demonic like that they're beyond human vocal capabilities some of the lyrics on this record were kind of ridiculous and outlandish - on tracks like prostitution or blood on the face why I'm not thanks but I'm not facts which simultaneously even though these tracks were odd they were also really big statements on death and violence and exploitation maybe even humanity as well and these songs were a kind of catchy - in an age where nobody is fazed by anything anymore sometimes I think it's truly difficult to make outlandish music and that's what I think great babies were doing on this record even if at times it was a little humorous and even though that outlandish mnestheus Ness was a little off-putting I came to really love this record by the end of the year and of course because I loved this record I was looking forward to great babies next record and on this record they have taken a noticeably different approach there are still characteristics on this album that were on their last LP like the loud overpowering deep bellowing vocals and grave babies are still pretty much making drum machine backed goth rock but the band has decided to give us a much more - ility record this time around the noise the abrasive keyboards and guitars the lo-fi recording it's pretty much all just out the window and now we have just a much clearer look at grave baby sound and the weird interludes and the transitional tracks from the last record are gone and I think the sense of humor from the last record has gone as well this is a much darker sadder and I think more serious record and unfortunately I think that's kind of what kills this record a little bit in a sense with crusher and with grade baby's previous output in general it's like they were trying to be so harrowing and so disturbing and just so gruesome that it had to be a joke like it was so ridiculous and I feel like they've kind of given that up in favor of just making an album that might not turn as many people off because it sounds like like they're actually taking it seriously or sounds like they're kind of playing it a little safe but I think as a result this record sounds a little I don't know just tame not that I think going for a cleaner sound was inherently a bad idea but the thing is is that it really puts great baby songwriting abilities on blast if the sounds are gonna be a little bit more middle-of-the-road a little bit less you know frightening and ear pummeling then it's really got to be the tunes that shine through and captivate and keep us coming back to the record the focus that this record has on songwriting is apparent right from the opening track here where we just get nothing but this really drab chorus which is pretty lifeless and just not really that catchy or interesting or anything there's a number of tracks off of great babies crusher like over an underground that were far catchy ER and on this record there are other slow kind of tedious and tone down tracks as well like the song punishment or the track something awful and some of the longer tracks on here really just aren't that fantastic either great babies have really tried to write some like four or five minutes on on this LP and I think their long game just isn't really as great as their short game with those harder-hitting just more brief tracks earlier in their discography I think this record really could have used some stronger writing and some actual sonic risks which I think should have been the the prerogative given that you have a more high fidelity record here you could play with more sounds on this record why just through all the weird left-field experimental shit onto your loaf I record where all that stuff inevitably isn't going to sound that great because of the low fire recording and a high-fidelity recording you can hit us with more sounds why play it safer the only thing that sonically grave babies really toy with on this record is that occasionally they work in these like really heavy like crud caked guitars that are super chuggy super massive sort of remind me of something that I would hear on like Alice in Chains or like a Type O Negative record or something like that there are actually some cartoony maniacal laughs on the very end of this record on the song war which sounds like they're straight off of a Halloween effects tape which is maybe the only truly silly moment this album actually brings to the table but by then it's just like too little too late to actually like start bringing some personality into the fold and oddly enough on this record as well I think great babies sort of show a lack of versatility too I mean they made a longer record here a 40-minute record but they didn't really expand their sound along with the expansion of the track length of the album length like the song positive aggression is sort of an example for me where this song at its core is actually a decent ballad but with the just really huge vocals and the cold icy guitars and the drum machines in the background it doesn't really sound that different from many other songs here I think that you know even some of the best goth rock bands out there knew when to take sort of a softer approach a softer touch when it came to you know a ballad sort of like the cure for example but grave babies instead just sort of stay into this one track of you know these hard-hitting drums these guitars this kind of guitar sound and these bellowing vocals we need to stick to this sound even though we're going longer on this record and I just again think that this album could have used some diversity could have used some versatility especially considering how they tried to string out their length here I thought this record was decent it has a lot of good moments to it but III think I am a little down on it just because I was looking for more I was anticipating more I thought the great babies would just continue to bring the personality and the quality of songwriting on this record that they had on their previous record but instead they just kind of made this transition from hilariously freaky to trying to make a record that is serious but also freaky and a little sad as well and I don't think that transition was completely successful on this LP it just kind of feels like they tried to make a more listenable record this time around and the the results are just less exciting you know and and and and that's all unless catchy - I'm feeling a light too decent 6 on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think about it did you love it if you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana great babies forever hi everyone you know who it is I hope you're doing well

RhDd_G4nGZ0,hi everyone flies an evite an O here the Internet's buzziest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new dr. Dre album Compton it's here it's finally here a new album from dr. Dre PhD it's an album it's a real album even though it says Compton the soundtrack this record is not officially a soundtrack and not to be construed as a direct soundtrack to the new NWA straight out of Compton movie that is coming out rather this is dr. Dre's first official record in like 16 years which around the time of announcing that this album was going to be released Dre also said that his long anticipated album detox was actually scrapped it was trashed apparently according to Dre it was not up to snuff and as a music fan I can appreciate that I can appreciate an artisan you know what this is not good I'm not going to release it I'm not going to have you pay for it I'm not going to have you spend your time on it because I don't think it's worth worth it it does not meet my quality standards that I have set thus far I appreciate that he's careful I appreciate that he makes careful calculated good decisions from NWA to Eminem and aftermath records to Kendrick and the Beats headphones to this new deal he's got going on with Apple music Dre has just been one good decision after another Dre has shown himself to be one of music's greatest businessmen to the point where he doesn't even really need to brag about it or show it in a song the the business papers and articles do that for him and it's totally cool that dr. Dre has made more money than any one person can spend in a lifetime but his silence on the music front over all these years has been kind of depressing and a little disheartening because every year as music fans would sort of discuss like what albums are you anticipating what albums are you anticipating coming up this year the ongoing joke would be that you know detox is coming out waiting for detox waiting for that detox to come out it's coming and even though was funny to joke about that sort of thing deep down we wanted it for better for worse we wanted it and that's because dr. Dre's is one of hip-hop's greatest producers he should be in your top five he helped craft the g-funk sound of the west coast he was there at the inception of gangsta rap the man has worked with and has helped popularize some of hip hop's and popular music's biggest faces Ice Cube Snoop Dogg Eminem Kendrick Lamar unless he's formally retired the man's musical voice and talents should be present in the current day hip-hop landscape and even though this record comes on the back of the NWA movie which kind of makes this album feel sort of like a business move for Dre I'm glad this record exists I'm glad Compton is here and not just because this record is Dre but also because it's um it's pretty good this LP is just over an hour long and it has an incredible amount of features most notably exhibit Snoop Ice Cube Eminem is on here as well John Connor of dr. Dre's aftermath records Jill Scott King Nez as well as on this album when you're looking at the feature list here it does read a little bit more like on listening to an album about Dre's career more than it is about Dre's hometown but the still dr. Dre did sort of help put Compton on the map musically so I guess he sort of allowed that leeway oh the game is on this record too cannot forget the game now there are a lot of artists on this record a lot of artists to keep track of however I didn't really go into this project worried because on previous records Dre has done a fantastic job of working with his guests working with the artists that he brings onto a record and making sure that they are plugged into good songs and that he is creating good songs with these artists he's not just inviting MCS on to just go off and just spit a verse a random nonsense he works with these artists to craft songs producers take notice of this take notice of the way that Drake guides his guests on this record he doesn't just have them on to just be like they're actually songwriting together and that's what makes the chronics so great that's what makes 2001 so great and that's what makes content really good - and I was also hoping that there was no song on this record as corny as I need a doctor the song medicine man with Eminem does approach that does border on that almost but it doesn't quite step over the same line that I need or tactic does so thankfully Dre avoids any super corny songs on this record and he also doesn't really deliver anything outside of movie a few cuts here that could be construed as like a traditional dr. Dre esque sound which in one breath I think is a little risky because you have fans that have been waiting for 16 years they're kind of waiting for the sound the ideas that you represent in hip hop to sort of come to life again in a new record but rather instead I like that Dre kind of kept things new kept things current because that's what has made his past records so fantastic and w-a was great because they were new they were fresh they were current the chronic was great because it was new it was fresh it was current it was cutting-edge and 2001 was great because it was new it was fresh it was current so again Dre keeps up that freshness that newness that current miss on Compton - Dre is more than just like this old g-funk sound he's a pretty versatile producer and is pretty progressive in his thinking going into this record he wants to do something that is focused on the younger hip-hop listener or at least an older hip-hop listener who was open to change and open to new sounds and open to more current trendy ideas just because Drago's trendy a little on this record does not necessarily mean he's sacrificing quality or our songwriting focus on this thing now when I say this record sounds current it mostly sounds current because of the instrumentals on here and in order to keep things sounding current on this record Dre brings on a series of different producers people like DJ dahi aftermath producer focus we have DJ premier on here nephew and a lot of other producers too there doesn't seem to be a single cut on this LP that Dre produces completely alone however his presence is still felt all over this record even on the tracks where he does not appear lyrically on here Dre does a great job of playing director however not to give the impression that there are a lot of songs on here that have no Dre whatsoever Dre pops up on quite a few tracks there are actually a lot of songs on here that are very Dre centric when it comes to his come up and his history and his current mind state if you want to hear Dre get personal on this LP listen to the closing track on here talking to my diary a little sentimental track for Dre if you somewhat suspect lines here and there but going back to the days of NWA Dre has never really been beyond sort of a vulnerable moment and there are a lot of those here he even gets kind of autobiographical on the song it's all on me we're on this track and the following cut - we get Dre rapping about not only his past and sort of him getting a little sentimental over eazy-e as well as just everything it's taken to get where he is but he's also feeling the pressure he's feeling the pressure from the label from the fans that one hears record he's feeling the pressure from his friends that need his help which may be him bringing that up onto a track feels a little melodramatic like he's really trying to you know like squeeze empathy out of this stone a beleaguered so much pressure but simultaneously I mean he is dr. fuckin Dre and I mean he's not in a position most people have ever been in in the music industry and I imagine a lot of eyes on him all the time because of how successful he's been and just how amazing his track record is so the pressure is probably real but back to this it's all on me track bj the chicago kid totally kills it on this track beautiful singing on this and dream manages to work in little singing in his verses on this track - that doesn't sound too bad and the instrumental is actually kind of beautiful and another thing I like about some of the tracks on this record is Dre is not really beyond making some big references to his early days as well as making songs that directly reference the culture and the streets that this kind of music comes from sometimes in the midst of just all the glamour of pop rap music I feel like the roots of hip-hop and the kinds of messages that turn up on a record like Straight Outta Compton are sort of you know lost and all the money everyone is making and all the parties that everyone's supposed to be sound tracking instead on a lot of tracks here Dre focuses on just more down-to-earth topics like on the song dark side gone which is an incredibly tortured track in the tracklisting here then we also have the song animals which is a really moving cut and sort of about how vulture like the media is and how it sort of exploits a lot of the problems black people have been going through in places like Ferguson and Baltimore where the news media doesn't really care about the everyday struggles or the people living in these neighborhoods but they will show up with cameras as soon as there's a protest or people are rioting or people are angry over the fact they don't feel safe in their own communities because of the police officers that are supposed to be protecting and serving and there's the song just another day which actually features the game it seems to kind of be a game song with some great production on it and game actually goes in on this track he goes in but the one thing about this track is that so it's it feels kind of like an interlude it's a short song it's really criminally short and could have used a strong hook and another verse it's actually one of the few moments on this record that feels kind of undercooked a bulk of the other tracks on this record are actually a little done to death in terms of the instrumentals and the guests brought on to sing on these choruses and the sound effects that kind of paint a picture of what the song is supposed to be about but we will get into that in a second now a bunch of the other cuts on this record aren't really so much dre focused as much as they are just really supposed to feature and create a platform for the guest artists on this album John Connor Snoop Dogg Kendrick so on and so forth and some of this album's best and most memorable tracks are actually the more Dre deficient cuts like the song genocide wonky crazy banger beat on this thing I love the beat on this track man it's like it's it's a really progressive instrumental I'm surprised and really happy that an instrumental kind of this cooky turned up on this record and Kendricks verse is awesome I'm in awe of just how off-kilter and warped and strange this beat is but simultaneously how murderous and gritty it is - then we have the slow jam on here for the love of money with Jill Scott and John Connor and Henderson PAC who are actually great together all together on this track it's a beautiful little ballad and the song satisfaction is another favorite on here and this one has snoop and Dre and the whole gang is here coming together talking about just fakeness in hip hop not really a a new refreshing topic or anything but it's actually one of the catchy ER songs on here and has a huge chorus it's just a well-crafted tune and I think over the years Dre's songwriting ability I mean he's a great producer but his songwriting ability is kind of like the unsung hero on a lot of his records and I feel like it comes through in full force on this song and the incredible song deep water is another highlight for me on here Kendricks verse is fantastic on this track and just the whole song itself is super intense super theatrical and I love how just the crazy screaming and drowning on the end of the song just really ties the whole thing up and makes the song feel so vivid and it kind of reminds me of a good kid maad city in a way in that it is theatrical I feel like I'm in a bit of a theater of the mind sort of situation here and actually to be honest production wise and just in terms of the tone this whole record reminds me of good kid maad city in a way and a little bit of a dr. Dre's 2001 mixed in there it doesn't remind me good kid in that I'm hearing a story or anything like that but just the flavor of the instrumentals on this record along with the fact that a lot of the songs here are so cinematic not just because the instrumentals are so lush and they're so colorful and they're so heavy and bangin and just vivid but also because Dre uses a lot of sound effects and uses a lot of sounds to sort of paint a picture as well whether it be with gunshots going off and police sirens in the background or that water in that drowning now occasionally I think the sound effects the overwrought instrumentals on this thing as well as kind of just the very loud in your face emcees on tracks like darkside gone and also loose cannons can be a little overkill and you end up hearing a song that's just like this complete jumble and I'm not really sure what to pay attention to or what direction the song is moving in especially on loose cannons I'm just like thinking like okay which have we gotten past the intro to this song yet like when does this song start the beat shits and the transitions on these songs just don't really sound that great to me they either come in out of the blue and don't really help the momentum of the song or they just kind of feel like totally nonsensical and they just kill the momentum of these tracks entirely and on the song issues I feel like while the gunshots definitely help paint the picture a little better they definitely overshadow the instrumental in the MCS a bit and and nor do I really care for the production on this track either the kind of diddling little guitar line that plays throughout much of this track along with you very cleanly some vocals don't actually create the the sense of urgency don't really reflect the grit that the scene here in this song is supposed to be portraying and that's another thing a few of these songs I mean they're a little overdone they're a little super super clean and just like bright and and don't really mesh that well with a lot of the gritty just tooth - in-your-face nasty emcees on this thing especially on this long talk about it with King mez loved his verse on this track dude is just nasty as hell on this track it's just kind of hard to go through this record without kind of rambling on about every single individual track because each track on this LP has a personality of its own as a sound of its own has direction of its own and just has a different vibe entirely not only because Dre is jumping around a little bit when it comes to instrumental styles on the cell P but also because you're getting different MCS and different lyrical approaches on each of these tracks too I mean the song Loose Cannons is entirely different from what is going on on the song animals like different message different tone different personality different instrumental different everything you know there's there's a wide breadth of emotions and expressions on this record and yet again I think it's all pulled together relatively well but having said all that all of my likes and my dislikes of this record I think Compton Net+ man net-positive mostly a very good record great effort from Dre glad he's still here glad he did this project I'm glad that he was able to get everybody who hopped onto this project onto this project maybe I wasn't so crazy about John Connors appearances never really been a big John Connor fan but I mean he's he's maybe uh my least favorite appearance on the record and he's not really bad here you know I think he's totally agreeable he brings a lot of energy he brings a lot of fire on the verses where he appears on this record and I think that was kind of the case for everyone here honestly I mean even Snoop himself when he appears here his two verses he was sounding mean and nasty as fuck he was not this kind of you know just like laid-back in a good mood sort of Snoop Dogg that you usually hear on a lot of his more recent records coming together with Dre again really made snoop sound like his old 90s nasty ass self and that's the thing about Dre you know honestly I don't know what it is and I don't think anybody knows what it is except for people who have worked with Dre in the studio but he just has something whether it's an idea or maybe it's his personality maybe it's the way he works with people he's just got something where I think he just natural brings out the best in people and even though this record does have some obvious and glaring flaws on handful of tracks here and there that's what he does for the most part on this on this project that's what he does on Compton he brings out some of the best verses I've ever heard out of some of the artists this on this record and he pairs these artists with these fantastic verses with some great production we cook here and there a week song here and there but it's an hour long 16 track album for the most part it's really good for the most part it's really enjoyable and for the most part I love this thing I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this album transition 
xCwJfkGdaFo,hi everyone crazy theny create a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd oh yeah time for with you Chelsea wolf abyss Chelsea wolf is a California guitarist singer songwriter who creeped into my life at around 2011 with this record apocalypsis which I'm probably not pronouncing correctly really heavy dark versatile melodic record which featured Chelsea Wolf's fantastic voice a wide array of influences from gothic rock to folk music and noise rock and art rock bands such as Sonic Youth or even Radiohead and even though a lot of musical styles a lot of rock styles came through on this record Chelsea Wolf's darkness and her voice really pulled it all together and left this thing feeling cohesive and then she had a sudden change of sound on her next full-length LP pain is beauty where she came through with some dark wave tracks some songs they had a strong electronic component to them and here again we had a versatile diverse record that was pulled together by the darkness by Chelsea wolf being just a representative of like the seventh ring or layer of hell or whatever and just her fantastic voice Chelsea wolf just has this knack for being able to I guess just give whatever musical style she's going for a very grim and and gloomy vibe now this new record over here was announced earlier this year I enjoyed the tracks leading up to the release of this album they sounded like Chelsea's heaviest and just most dense tracks yet really inspired by doom metal and a little bit of shoegaze to walls of distortion and guitars and of course Chelsea's voice was like piercing these walls of guitar and distortion and electronics and drums and that made me excited to hear what this was all about now that the title of this record really just hit me just now abyss yeah that's really what it freakin sounds like and and I did not walk away from this room from this record disappointed I actually think it's Wolf's most focused project yet she's not really jumping from Jean the genre to genre on this album and just sort of relying on her voice and the fact that she does have this really dark approach to writing and recording sort of pull it all together these songs are consistently heavy and thick and rich with sound these songs are brooding they are dark there's like no light on these tracks it's not even lit by the moon not even moonlit nope when you listen to this record you will hear just rumbling drones and blaring guitars and primal thunderous drums eerie singing and occasionally some percussion that is sequenced it's electronic and it's very rigid and cold when it's playing through this record is as vivid as it is dense right from the start with the song carrion flowers a track that starts off with this gurgling rumbling distorted bass and it's it's so disturbing sounds like something out of a freaking horror movie and these notes they kind of squirm in the squelch and and they don't sound like they're being played from just any regular instrument at they sound like they're sample then manipulated and building against these riffs we have Chelsea's fantastic voice we have these primal drums and later on in the song when out when the instrumentation just explodes I'm at a little bit of a loss for words for how it sounds but it's it's frightening it's really a fantastic start to the album this track eventually gives way to some more dumi and metallic guitar riffs on the song iron moon not quite as industrial as the opening track here but still a really enjoyable song and switching off with these dumi guitars are these kind of low-key just very quiet folky verses that are very beautiful and kind of you know eerie I mean while they do have this really tender sort of aesthetic to them whenever I hear them I know something horrible is just around the corner so it's little ominous the monolithic guitars that burst back into the track sound fantastic and Chelsea's voice again I mean she's she's killing it on this record her singing is pained it's passionate she laces these heavy walls of sound with it as well as with some other weird miscellaneous sounds and tones to sort of like on the song dragged out we're together Chelsea's voice which is drenched in effects and the wailing guitar leads and the do me riffs come together in kind of a psychedelic way the song gray days is really nice because it feels like it has a cello or some kind of strings worked into the do me heavy guitars and distorted tones on this track and there's a massive ending on this track too a lot of the songs on this record actually progress in a really linear fashion toward these really huge climactic gargantuan endings the song after the fall is another example of that which features these swelling bright really sharp synth chords that play throughout the track and then suddenly out of nowhere there's this lake in the midst of all these heavy guitar passages there's this a bit of a weird just prickly electronic interlude that is a very colorful but still maintains the darkness of the rest of the track it's very sudden it's very unexpected but that's just another one of the weird linear twists and turns that this record throws at its listeners and it's it's not necessarily something I think you're going to enjoy or totally be able to pull apart on an initial couple of listens this album you really got a it's an abyss man it's a freaking it's calling the best so because of how dark it is it may take you a minute to get your bearings the amount of presence and atmosphere and color on these songs is fantastic there are a few songs on here that take a more subtle approach I appreciate that Chelsea wanted to break things up and do something a little different though I don't think these songs necessarily reflect some of her best songwriting on this record like the song ma where I think the chord progression on this track is a little drab or the song crazy love where the lyrics and just the chord progression are a little redundant actually I mean I think she's written better songs on this record the issue a lot of the time is that these songs are buried under these light years and layers of drones and distortion and guitars and drums and and her voice is kind of laced into these walls and it can be a little hard to interpret or read sometimes though I do think the clothes are on here is fantastic one of the most sparse tracks on the entire record but it has all these like weird broken just eerie sour piano arpeggios that are fantastic and kind of make my skin crawl it's a really good closer to this record make sure that the album ends as strong as it starts and between all the strings and the pianos and just all the the extra sort of prettier instrumentation laced into this record it's nice to hear Chelsea's starting to incorporate a lot of the stuff she picked up on that acoustic mini album EP that she put together I liked it but I was just kind of hoping to hear some of that finesse some of that more acoustic roots your instrumentation turn up in her heavier stuff and it's doing that here so I'm happy about that though I suppose I do have a few issues with this LP to go back to the song Crazy Love I feel that this is an example of a moment on this record where Chelsea's vocal delivery doesn't feel quite as passionate as many of the other songs hear her voice actually sounds a little disconnected and there are some other spots on this record where I think the heavy walls of sound do compete with Chelsea's voice a little but she sounds a little overpowered she sound a little buried inside these walls of sound and there's also the fact that this record is fifty five minutes which on the whole isn't a bad thing but fifty five minutes is a long time to be drawing on this very heavy brooding depressing just unrelentingly gloomy sound and if you don't like these linear epic builds that this album throws at you you might have a hard time getting into these tracks you may find that these builds actually deflate the momentum of the songs I mean the one build that I may be the least craziest about was survive and it's not an awful moment on the record but I just thought the drums could have done a better job of actually complimenting the groove of this build just to make it actually drive a little bit harder but aside from that I love this record thought it was a great record I think it's Chelsea's most cohesive and most massive release yeah it starts strong it ends strong it is a few potholes in the middle or a few songs that pale in comparison to other songs tracks that go a little bit softer and not that I wish that they were hard and heavy like the rest of the songs actually wish they were a little more subtle in order to sort of create that contrast in order to just sort of sound even more different from the the bulk of the songs on this project but all in all this is a very solid very enjoyable gloomy gargantuan gothic rock album and I'm feeling a light decent 8 on it transition have you given this record to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Chelsea wolf abyss forever 
swQI_FNyS6M,hi everyone Anthony Fantan Oh Internet's busiest music nerd here and it's time for review of the new little dickie record professional rapper the rap game Seth Rogen the great white hope of all those inhabiting the suburbs right now is here with a big commercial breakout project little dickie professional rapper he's from Philly and this thing is huge it is a big buzzy huge thing it's 90 minutes long and it has some pretty surprising features on it to the likes of Snoop Dogg Hannibal Buress appears on an interlude here Fetty WAP rich homie Quan t-pain is on here in Brendon Urie of Panic at the Disco pops onto a hook on this record as well which is not a bad feature set for somebody who is just coming up a lot of the initial singles that made Dickey so hot this past year appear on this record like classic male pregame and let me freak but back to the features on this thing not only is the feature list impressive but some of the features on here actually really impressive sounds like quite a bit of effort was put into some of these features especially with Snoop Dogg snoop does not just casually saunter onto this record and bring his usual brand of charisma snoop plays kind of a character on this record in a sense himself because he's sort of like this veteran rapper this experienced type this guy who I guess is representing hip hop and he's kind of playing the role of the employer in this conversation with little Dickie this wrapped conversation that reads a lot like a job interview professional rapper get it and it's impressive this this back and forth the amount of effort that went into this track and little Dickie when he's rapping he goes into his background what music he's trying to make how he's trying to change the game the demographic of people that he's trying to shoot for his sense of humor that pops up in his music I mean I like the level of detail on this song it sounds like a lot of effort was put into it however when you get down to the nitty gritty of what is said on this track in little dickie essentially kind of making the case for himself and it ends with Snoop Dogg givin him the job however from the standpoint of a listener from a hip-hop fan little Dicky did not really make his case lyrically I think this is the kind of track a guy like Hobson would make if he were born to different parents and was trying to get into the hip-hop game but was crushed by white guilt the very notion that little Dicky is is going to change the game with this music which he pushes on this track that he's going to change the game that he wants to change the game that he wants to provide a different message a different point of view that is going to alter the history of hip-hop in some kind of way to advance that idea it's just preposterous it really is at the very least disingenuous like little Dicky knows how BS that statement is but yet he's saying it anyway and it's not like we've had a shortage of game-changing albums over the past five years my Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy Flocka Valley we've had good kid maad city as well as to pimp a butterfly and xxx Live Love ASAP run the jewels we've also had cultural phenomenons like Odd Future as well as freakin McLemore these are examples of game-changing things of things that at least come close to changing the game if not changing the game little Dicky I don't understand how he's thinking of changing the game with this record because all he's really doing with the music here is engaging non rap fans with the most surface level content imaginable now there are some moments on this record where Dicky does draw up a good song the song saved that money for example which has Fetty WAP on the hook really big chorus on this track and it's catchy it's got kind of a DJ mustard inspired instrumental and lyrically it's pretty cute it's pretty funny kind of takes that same sort of save your money kids vibe that macklemore's thrift shop does but I don't know with a catchy or more updated more current more trendy aesthetic the song who knew as well I thought it was really catchy and I think this is the one moment where little Dickies message actually matches up with the quality of the song I mean this track is sort of about who knew little Dicky had this talent had this songwriting ability had this ability to sort of capture the ears and the hearts of hip-hop listeners and and assertive oh wow man the stutes the stutes talented and the song bro which I thought was really good not really because it's a fantastic song songwriting wise but with mostly just some simple drums in the background and a really nice beat and Dickie's fantastic flow because the dude can rap really well this track came together amazingly I mean he came through with ton of charisma on here good performance and it was really entertaining even if some of his bars here and there are a little cornball and I like the song the antagonist - at least with Dickies delivery on the song he sounds like he's trying to do something more serious say something more serious is more stone-faced and really determined and focused on this track but still he's really difficult to I guess understand on this track because he seems kind of like a waffler when it comes to his mission statement or his I don't know what whatever he wants to do as an artist on this very track he says that his favorite artists aren't joke artists they're serious artists and he lists some of them out so he's this artist that makes joke rap songs but yes I'm Alania sley says I don't enjoy joke rap I don't enjoy that stuff and he says that the stuff he is making isn't necessarily the stuff he would like to be making on this song that's what he says he says that what music listener wants to hear an artist that they're listening to say hey listen I know you like this music but this isn't the music I would like to be making or this isn't my good music this is just the music I'm selling to you and is popular so on this track he is sending us this message that he is a serious artist kind of masked in this goofy parody sort of look but then simultaneously at the beginning of this record he says that he likes hip-hop because it allows him to sort of reinvent himself in one breath he's saying that he wants to be serious he wants to be real he wants to be direct he wants to be upfront with us but also he's dabbling in the fake and the boo-boo-boo-boo-boo on this same track Dickey goes as far as to warn doubters warned haters and tell them oh they don't know they don't know the amazing music he's got cooking up they don't know the amazing music that he's got hidden back there in the vault it's so amazing and when he drops it it's just going to be he says on the song that that these silly songs aren't really what he'd like to be doing oh you you know like making silly songs you know lyrical silly songs could have fooled me dude personality white crime let me free classic male pregame this pillow-talk track there's just ten minutes of cringe and awkwardness where he's essentially pillow talking just all this ridiculous off the dome shit with this girl that he just got with and the song makes absolutely no sense there's nothing about this record that up to this point has said to me you know what this guy really should do a ten minute song yeah that's exactly what this record needs a ten minute song and all of these funnier tracks on this record without exception are about as funny as an Adam Sandler movie no not old Adam Sandler like the movie where he's playing his own twin sister that Adam Sandler I would not listen to any of these tracks not again not willingly never again and not to mention all the awful filler and pad out tracks that extend these songs for what reason I don't know the album's like are it's it's ninety minutes why is it ninety minutes let me freak for real though which is just like this really awful auto-tune some trap ballad and then the antagonist part to this project is just so frustrating what artist warns people on his project that his next project will be good and serious and actually enjoyable it's because he knows the mindless people who are listening to this record for classic male pregame and all that won't really be listening that deeply into these other lyrics where the people who are actually realizing how corny this record is they're going to need a warning they're going to need a message to tell them hey guys hey listen I know all this crap that I made that's crap well you know what I got good stuff I got good stuff well if you do it's not on this record and I can appreciate an artist putting out great record after a bad record I could appreciate being on the wrong side of history but if that's going to be the case with me and little Dickie it's not going to be on this project this album is essentially an overinflated novelty record some novelty hip hop over here is really what it comes down to it's a silly little joke record I think it's actually kind of disrespectful to hip hop in general and for whatever reason this album is convinced of like some illusions of grandeur because Dickie can flow fast and because some dudes that are college age like to pregame to this dudes music and also because it seems like little Dickie puts an incredible amount of effort into some really awful concepts like on that pillow-talk track and also on the truman track that closes this record out where it kind of starts off like a rap song but it just ends up in this really unentertaining boring diatribe about everything from sending pictures of his asshole the TMZ to make money to this whole freaking spiel about having sex to music again we're getting another 10 minutes song on this record and even at this point little Dickie has done nothing to make anybody who's listening to this record critically sit through a 10-minute song this record fails as a legitimate hip-hop record this record fails as a comedy record which it mostly is because almost nothing here is funny and there even some I don't know toned down more melodic songs where I think Dickie is trying to get a little more serious on here that a few of the funnier tracks on here a few maybe like just the song white crime could have made for a decent Lonely Island song there's really nothing else I could say nice about this record it's it's just really obnoxious to listen to again not funny the productions okay a few of the songs are decent and I think little Dickie in a weird way has at least some kind of potential I mean the technical ability is most certainly there but the message in the philosophy that this record sends is absolute trash I'm he's telling us that he's serious in one breath but yet he's just making a bunch of ridiculous pap when he's not telling us how serious he is and how much great awesome serious music he's got hidden away in the vault somewhere which I mean I'm excited I'm excited for the day it actually sees the light of day because then that might actually be a record worth listening to I'm feeling a strong one too a light too on this thing transition have you given this record or listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music review forever 
WR8zJeHPIXI,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new leaf Scouts album as well it's super offensive the things that I don't like the things honey turn out gooood just shut the up high focus records artists UK rapper and producer and also battle rapper Lee Scott and this is his new record which is entirely produced by producer and fellow rapper dirty Dyke who is actually quite cartoony clever very energetic and animated has a very funny delivery but not in a sort of jokey comedy type way and he seems to be heavily influenced by East Coast hip-hop as well and that style carries over in his production on this new Lee Scott project right here but in comparison to dirty Dyke Lee Scott has a very different vocal and lyrical approach on this record Lee Scott isn't quite so overt he's not so silly and over the top he's actually pretty laid-back chill but also dark kind of slack-jawed which is definitely a change of pace from the very aggressive delivery he puts out there when he's in the midst of a rap battle which ultimately i think is a pretty good thing Lee Scott is a rapper who understands that there are some things that play some things that work in that battle context that don't necessarily carry over into that album recording context now this album is quite musical especially with the jazzy crackling very textured beats all over this record with nice thick warm bassline some DJ scratches here and there with some esoteric vocal snippets or samples that complement the theme or the concept of the song stylistically this record is coming straight out of that boom bap that jazz rap realm but Lee's approach to this style is very dark like this record is dark lit only by the yellowy tint of street lights and traffic signals and I would also agree with many of the Libs and leaf scots ramblings and his lyrics all over this record that describe his flow in this album as a butchery if you're into artists like Joey badass or Earl or Quasimodo MF DOOM and even the more depressing side of Mac Miller I think Lee Scott is especially like those last few that I mentioned except he's a little more devious and mischievous sometimes somewhat creepy at least on the surface when you're listening to the aesthetic of this record when you get into Lee's lyrics on a deeper level you're gonna hear that a lot of what he's saying is kind of absurd ridiculous playful maybe even has a tongue-in-cheek tone to it or is it least satirical or kind of cynical or pulling a sharp jab at some kind of pop-culture reference or phenomenon and there's a little bit of a lyrical spectrum on this album some tracks like 8 o'clock in the morning are a little too verbose and and heady and just are really difficult to interpret for me anyway and the hook just really isn't they're just not really a strong song structure on this track and then on the flip side of that we have the song to sell drugs which lyrically feels just overly simplistic plus I was not feeling the weak singing on the hook of this track but there are a great deal of songs on this record that actually reach a very happy and enjoyable middle ground like the title track the opener on this thing which i think is a pretty excellent mission statement for this record there is also the very grimy and aggressive don't make me wear some of the most violent lyrics on this entire record turn up against a pretty awesome just off-kilter choppy jazz rap beat and then there are a series of other songs that kind of grab a lyrical concept and Lee Scott does a good job of drawing that concept out for the entirety of the track like on the song manatee rap which is a bit of a play on the joke the South Park made about Family Guy about a bunch of manatees being in a tank and then just randomly assembling these places and I guess situations and jokes for these sort of comedic detours and non sequiturs that occurs throughout Family Guy episodes and it's an interesting sort of observation on how rappers is kind of string together entire songs by pulling together all these ideas that when you look at them you know in the wider scheme of things they don't really have much of anything to do with each other other than that they're all pulled together into this one track again interesting observation but not really an amazing song but the song spaced though which I really like actually sticks to a lot of interstellar intergalactic themes throughout the lyrics on this track and I thought that was a pretty smart approach the song watch TV is a huge pop-culture jab and just kind of makes fun of the whole TV medium and the songs everything is money as well as the song money grip are dealing in greed and materialism though not in an obvious way it's not likely Scott is like rapping about the Rolly on his wrist or anything like that kind of more about the power of money or just kind of hogging a pile of money and I have to commend Leon his lyrics I think with almost every hook here with every verse here he's coming through with a thought-provoking line or just a funny observation or something clever or an interesting piece of wordplay or he's just drawing on a theme that he set for himself on a track in a creative way this is a thinking man's rap record however on this album I do wish he'd be a little bit more aggressive just give his rhymes a little bit more oomph from time to time because the constant somewhat monotone just really laid-back delivery that we has on this record does become a bit of a drag after a while I really sort of start feeling my mind gravitate toward the instrumentals and I'm not really feeling much of what Lee is saying at all just because the energy isn't really there I guess the lack of energy kind of gets to me after one song after another even if Lee does seem to be making some cool or interesting points with what he's saying I think if there's any one line that kind of sums up Lee's delivery on this record is actually on one of the final tracks of this album ironically the most aggressive track on the LP the song don't tell me and I do love the second verse on this album because Lee really changes up his flow gets a little speedier here and there and he says call me Alan Watts the point which I think is a really amazing way of kind of summing up the strong sense of depression and apathy but also gusto and and and and humorousness that that pervades this album it's an interesting mix of emotions but I just wish that we saw different mixes of emotions going from track to track overall I like this record wasn't blown away by it I think Lee has a lot of talent I think there are some good songs on here and if you're looking for some interesting rappers from the UK give this record to listen as well as many of the people on the same roster as him on high focus because there are a lot of talented rappers over there and I also appreciate that Lee has done his hip-hop homework and is influenced so much by hip-hop music from America but it doesn't sound like he's just playing rapper or anything like that he seems like a pretty versatile talented artist I just don't think all of those talents and all that versatility turned up on this record because when you watch him in the midst of a rap battle and when you listen to him on a record it's like hearing two completely different artists I just wish a little bit more of that aggressively Scott showed up on this record and and that's all I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition have you given this record to listen if you have did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Lee Scott forever 
Emyn3FF_V18,oh yeah hey buddy hey buddy let's do a review the best teeth in the game here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Lianne La Havas record blood this gruesomely titled album is the sophomore full-length record of uk-based singer/songwriter fantastic guitarist as well Lianne La Havas I really liked her breakout debut record is your love big enough there were some pretty awesome catchy somewhat quirky and sweet takes on soul and pop music on that record as well as like a little bit of jazz too there were some really good singles on this thing like Lost and Found especially the song forget which I thought was really great but Lee Anne sort of seemed like she was still in the midst of coming into her own still growing as an artist I didn't love this record wasn't head over heels for it it seemed like LAN had some good taste she had a lot of talent as a singer and she could most definitely play as well and she had an appreciation for sound and texture and aesthetic especially on the song forget where I think the guitars on that track and just the booming drums on that song as well sound fantastic I just kind of came away from that album thinking okay this is good but I see more potential in this there should be cooler awesomer things coming in the future for this artist it just seemed like LeAnn had too much potential for me to just like fold on her next record however though when she came out with the debut single for this new album over here unstoppable it didn't really take off like I was hoping it would take off it's not a terrible song but it just doesn't really have that much single potential it's kind of a slow burner not only does the song just kind of stop out of nowhere which makes its title kind of funny but that's not really the reason I think people aren't into it it's a very lavish emotional modern soul ballad it's not a banger though I do think the song does have some of land's best vocals yet put to a record I just think the song requires you know a couple listens to really get it and appreciate it and see how good it is that's all it doesn't have that instantaneous spark a single should this song I was really kind of mild toward until I had actually in the album itself multiple listens it was only after that that unstoppable actually won me over but you know maybe on this record Leon isn't going for Sparky she's not going for instantaneous maybe she's purposely trying to put together a more patient album and not really taking the artsy bubblegum angle that she did on the song forget maybe this new album is going to be taking a more mature approach that the patient fans will enjoy I'm patient lay it on me and that is mostly the exact direction this entire album goes in I think LeAnn goes a little bit more soul and a little bit more jazz on this record than she does straight pop but like with the song unstoppable even though I do love that songs huge strength sections it's awesome soaring vocals land isn't much for an ending on some of these songs like the song ghost which just abruptly ends out of nowhere or the song wonderful which just repeats into oblivion and it just kind of finishes as the song is kind of getting tiresome to listen to or the song grow which just kind of meets a sudden fade-out that just brings the song down to allow the next track to pop it but despite the endings on this LP being kind of weak or just really non-existent I think this record does feature a lot of improvements for LeAnn for one I think she tests the limits of her voice with some really subtle powerfully emotional ballads as well as some louder tracks to where she is just really pushing her vocals just getting really loud passionate voluminous and I think LAN brings forward some more mature lyrics on this record as well even if a lot of them are sort of lovesick I think she approaches some of the romance inspired situations on this album with a really level head and some agreeable points of view like on the song what you don't do which does have this kind of cutesy Bubblegum's soul instrumentation that kind of reminds me of something like Meghan Trainor would hop on to but Lee Ann does this instrumentation just as she does this song justice with not only a great vocal performance but what she's saying to saying that she doesn't need this person to prove his love to her this person doesn't need to prove their love to her in general because it's what this person doesn't do that shows her that this person loves her he's not playing games he's not doing these horrible things to her he's not this kind of person who will sort of do a heel turn and commit this horrible act and hurt her feelings and then try to make up for it by buying a lot of gifts or just trying too hard he's just like you know a really solid reliable dude and if you want more proof on this record that Lianne La Havas has has matured and grown as a singer-songwriter I don't really think you need to look any further than the song grow the amazing chord progression on this track as well as the fantastic finger picking sounds like a nylon guitar on the song could be wrong but it has that nice warm nylon sound and the chord progression on this track is like almost Spanish guitar inspired and the way that the chorus explodes with the drums and the bass and it just sounds so heavy and how the verses by comparison are so bare and skeletal but still powerful and emotional because land singing is top-notch on this part of the song she just has this great dynamic with her voice I mean when she goes subtle when she goes quiet she's just as emotional as when she's just you know really turning up and really getting powerful that's sort of the thing that was lost on me a little bit on the new Florence and the Machine album there was just really no variation it was just always intense always loud always belting always yeah where's LeAnn I mean she has these peaks and valleys that make these songs a bit of an emotional rollercoaster Tanith annette tada I can't sing her parts on this track but it's a fantastic song and whenever it's out I just want to you know pretend like I can sing like she sings and even though I like these louder tracks on the record it's really some of the softer and just quieter songs in the tracklisting that really pull me in and woo me like the song Tokyo has a bit of an 80s R&B vibe to it with a bit of slap bass in the verse there that sounds real nice the song wonderful awesome ballad with some great subtle quiet string flourishes in the instrumental - and the song ghost takes this kind of jazz guitar direction which I think she took on her last record with the song age but that song just felt so cutesy and it felt so silly whereas ghost takes a much more serious approach LeAnn's lyrics and her delivery on this tracker legitimately moving legitimately emotional and the flute on this track - is a really nice touch I think the only song in the whole track listening here that I didn't really care for was never get enough and the reason why was the production which was so good up until this point the production track for track for track on this record is fantastic even though LeAnn works with a myriad of different producers but on this one song we have this kind of skeletal subtle acoustic guitar back verse like there are many of on this record and then all of a sudden we explode into these booming drums and these compressed distorted guitars and kind of this howling guitar lead that sounds like it's trying to pull like a jimi hendrix and there's like almost no real significant tension build-up leading into these booming choruses and ultimately what kind of turns me off about these choruses Land's vocals just all of a sudden go all distorted and the compression on these courses is so heavy that even though I hear distortion and it sounds like things should be loud it doesn't actually feel any louder than the verses sounded with the acoustic guitars though it's not an exact comparison I kind of feel like all of a sudden I've gone from hearing land do an intimate acoustic performance to listening to her play with an electric rock band through like a McDonald's drive-thru speaker I just don't think the explosiveness of the instrumentation that Leeanne and her producer batson on this track we're going for is is actually their overall I think this is a good record I think it's a really good record I think Lianne La Havas came through there are songs that I do wish just had stronger endings or were a little bit longer or a little bit more fleshed out but other than that I mean there's so many great things about this album I think the lyrics are great I think the singing is great I think the chord progressions are great I think the production and the instrumentation sounds fantastic I mean even the arranged instrumentation doesn't sound tacked on it actually complements the core drums and guitars and keys and what-have-you really well and most importantly I just could really strong feeling of love from this record like authentic love not like love just went into it which I'm sure it did but like these songs are just so drenched in the idea of love just feel so real and it makes me want to be in love and I feel fortunate enough to be in the position where I actually am and love very and love thank you thank you thank you okay you're like I'm out of here would you know baby what a little baby I would highly suggest highly recommend this record if you're looking for something copy sweet really soulful with some great singing with some great lyrics with some solid hooks with some great instrumentation too and with a lot of emotion I think Lianne La Havas she's got a lot going for herself on this record and I hope to see her just continue to improve things in the future those endings got to get those endings on there tie up all the loose ends I'm feeling a strong 72 a light 8 on this thing transition have you given this record to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Lianne La Havas blood forever 
uSLzYLdocHY,can reserve all humidity suck Stan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new piss grave record being this album it offends me so it's like really gross banished album banned this album it's not good being this album suicide euphoria is the full-length debut record of Philadelphia's pissed grave and obviously this band's name and their incredibly gruesome album cover over here caught my attention just long enough to check out their music however going into this record I didn't really expect anything that I would be head over heels for I kind of expected a really kind of gruesome somewhat tongue-in-cheek porno grind record maybe with like a lot of pig sounds and squealing and all that kind of stuff but in fact this is actually a death metal record which there you go you know what they say never judge an album by the bathtub of liquefied human remains on its cover now death metal at this point is a pretty well established genre with its rolling double bass drums it's grimy filthy blood caked guitars got a got a guttural vocal style as well and death metal has come a long way it's progressed a lot since its inception decades ago and pissed grave seems to be bringing back gruesome in the genre with this album which is a welcomed decision for me even though flashy technical death metal can show that death metal itself can have versatility can have finesse but let's not forget that this is a genre that was meant to shock and disturb and these progressive technical death metal bands they have they have drum triggers they have amp plugins they have high-end editing software where is the technology to make death metal that is freaky and scary and blood-curdling is there a plugin that helps my death metal record sound like raw sewage spewing forward through my stereo speakers if there is piss grave is most definitely using it because this album is filthy it disgusting and it is in and out in about 30 minutes it does not overstay its welcome this album is determined it's focused and it is cutthroat and then after it cuts your throat it probably defecates in it the vocals on this record are absolutely monstrous I don't just feel like I'm I'm inside the mouths of the vocalists as these vocals are being delivered I feel like I'm like down past the gullet like going through into the belly down on my way into the intestines and I'm just like in the vocalists stomach as his body is well I just like rumbling from the throaty growling vocals and these vocals fit perfectly with the heavy thudding drums on this album not a lot of resonance with these drums they kind of sound like I'm listening to the drum heads replaced with just strips of leather maybe just like leathered human skin like they stripped the skin off of people's bodies and turn them into drum heads and they're just beating that human skin and and making sounds with that and then they're just the disgusting buzzsaw guitars all over this album - which are often tremolo picked and sometimes layered for these really ugly dissonant harmonies pissed crave is just really good on this record at stacking just layers upon layers upon layers of chaos and ugliness on top of one another now despite all the gross filthy sounds all over this album pissed grave actually delivers some pretty tight performances on here it's not like the the playing is SuperDuper messy it's actually pretty measured and very hard-hitting like very precise executioner who likes to just chop people's heads off so that the heads pop off go fly-in for like yards however though this album can be a bit of an onslaught it is at time sort of like this aggressive blur of blood splatter and disembodied limbs still though I would say there are plenty of highlights in the short run time of this album for one the first 10 seconds of this album is easily the most disgusting thing I've heard this year the first 10 seconds then quickly after this just disturbing introduction we're eating these twisted winding guitars relentless just pummeling drums and over the top of this stuff we're getting vocals that sound like I'm listening to the howls and the cries and the screams and the growls of this weird mutant who is locked up in this padded room and he is fighting to escape it this record just kicks off with some truly nightmarish shit and pretty much every track here is similarly brutish but still each track here does take its own slight approach to brutality there are moments of extreme noise and fury to the point where in comparison to the first track or some of the slower tracks here is like I actually feel and this this is weird to think considering just the way this record sounds wow this song is actually angry or in noisier and more aggressive than some of the other tracks like the song prevail in Hell which quite literally it does sound like this song would would play over pretty well with the hell crowd and the second runner-up for the most aggressive track on this album would have to be pain and Chapman and then there's the title track the way that switches back and forth just alternating in its speed between these two grooves are these two different passages and riffs and it just kind of builds up this weird redundant tension until the very end where all of a sudden the band breaks into these slow heavy guitar passages it kind of fits the title of the album in that it is a little euphoric in a way and then there are some spots on this record that are really groove heavy I mean some really grooving freaking head-banging metal riffs come through like the second sorrowful mystery the song titles on this thing man the song titles the song fields of scattered bones takes a slower approach somewhat dumi riffs on this track and some blazing actually melodic guitar soloing on the song to for a split second that goes over pretty well and I like the slow heavy outro on the song impaled vibration to this band definitely brings some kind of idea or just level of variation to the table there is musicality to this record but it seems like they tried their best to give us variety give us some different speeds give us some different flavored riffs and give us some tracks that are really disharmony us give us some tracks that are a little more melodic but keep it all as disgusting as possible and I think they succeeded at that as about as well as they possibly could I'm not going to lie if you give this record kind of a cursory listen I mean even even after the many many listens I give into this thing in a sense it is still kind of one-dimensional because the aggression man it is just a relentless but this record does make up for in the fact that it is a shorter album and I think the the level of aggression that this record showcases the the level of noise is so garish and in a way weird and just so unusual you know I'm not going to say unique because there are other very ugly death metal records out there and there are a lot of ugly porno grind records out there too I mean I think even a little uglier than this but this album doesn't feel sort of ridiculous in its ugliness and it's sort of filth it actually embraces in a very serious and very stone-faced scary at times way so I think these guys kept it filthy they kept it gross they kept it disgusting they kept it blood-soaked but they didn't go so far that it felt like I was listening to a really corny be horror film or something like that this album at times was like legit freakishly scary and again unusual unusual and and and I celebrate it for that and I think it is entertaining for that I'm feeling a strong 72 a light eight on this thing transition have you given this record to listen if you have were you completely disgusted by it or was it a barrel of monkeys and you had a lot of fun let me know and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantino piss grave forever 
QPH3sIULI30,totally dumb Tanana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Wilco record Star Wars this is a new free album from famed band Wilco and I simply say band because Wilco has covered so many musical bases over the years from raw to Vulcan singer/songwriter music country and Americana and a little bit of alt rock and art rock as well and their latest records have been especially turbulent and versatile like their self-titled album or their very peppy scrappy and kind of rough around the edges the whole love and I think Star Wars kind of takes off where the whole love left off a little bit it is similarly rough and rowdy though only relatively so it's just kind of rowdy for a Wilco record it's just wild within reason even if this album's introductory track is like legitimately a piece of noise rock which I wish went a little harder and heavier but it would actually be cool to hear Wilco go in this direction on some other tracks and another thing I like about this record are the really sort of thin brittle crunchy guitars and the the the in the moment groovy drumming and sometimes Tweety's somewhat disheveled vocals Jeff Tweedy that is the the band's frontman there are so many performances on this record that just feel really live and in the moment especially on the tail end of the song you satellite which sort of develops into this Jam of sorts that increasingly gets more distorted and more noisy it kind of washes over me sort of like this wall of shoegaze egit ours as it plods along and the end of the song more dot dot dot is similarly distorted and heavy I would say overall this album really kind of reads not as much like a clean concise studio album more like just a really good home recording which is flawed in just all the right ways and really intimate there are tunes on this record that I enjoy especially on the more quirky first half like the introductory track like more and the song random name generator which I thought was not only noisy but very playful too but I think the very obvious downside to this record is that Jeff Tweety's vocals don't have anywhere near as much character as the guitars and the melodies and just generally the production on this album does and it's not that the songs aren't good I actually think there's some really good songs in the tracklist here but Tweety singing especially on these more upbeat these nuttier tracks just really isn't there I mean it just kind of seems like emotionally he's a little out to lunch or just a little too relaxed although he does give some emotional performances on some of the sadder tracks here like on the song taste the ceiling one of my favorite tracks on here a heartbreaking song and the song magnetized too especially at the start of this track which is the outro and even though it does get peppier as it moves along in the second half the the introduction to this track is a little bit of a tearjerker but then again there are more upbeat there are rougher and weirder tracks like pickled ginger like the joke explained where there definitely some Dylan isms coming through on the vocals here the song called slope the song king of you where I wish Jeff Tweety's vocals were a little more expressive and a little less standoffish and just trying so hard to play it cool also star wars is a pretty short albums just about 30 minutes or so and it was a free record so going into it I guess I didn't really feel that invested in it you know it just kind of felt like this record coming out of the blue they gave it away for free maybe to just kind of remind us that they're here and they're doing something and just the general aesthetic of this album felt kind of rough at home recorded to the point where I mean they've made better quality records than this and but still III guess it was kind of interesting and fun to hear Wilco drum up the sounds that they did on this album this record sounded fun to listen to in that as I was listening to it was like man this this thing must have been really fun to record and just kind of you know hang around with your friends and and just kind of conjure up these sounds and and sort of search for the guitar tones and the keyboards and just the the drumbeats that they created on this noble noble noble just kind of collaborating and writing and creating and recording as you're going along this album felt so in the moment you know and and and I feel like that has its positives and its negatives dogs barking the positives is that it definitely gives this album character and it gives this album texture and it makes a pretty sound rich but the negative is that some of the performances are okay some of the vocals are just okay and some of the songs are just okay obviously I don't I don't think Wilco went into this album with a whole lot of intentions or sort of clear ideas it kind of felt like they went into this record sort of just relying on the jams that they were doing together to sort of tease out any ideas or tease out any any really cool song concepts and I think for the most part it works but it's not 100% accurate as far as a method goes at least in the way it's applied on on this record I'm feeling a light a decent six on this thing transition have you given the tracker to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think eyes are of an axe and that's it you have to be Fantana wilco star wars forever 
KgWqB9hpIpQ,Hiero one Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the most painful monthly segment of this channel the why you know review where I dive into a series of Records in brief that I did not get a chance to review over the course this past the month so I figured I would talk about them again in brief in this video in sort of a gauntlet fashion let the games begin you know Monsanto sucks no Monsanto sucks we don't mind saying uh sucks you know not saying uh sucks you know not saying uh sucks no Monsanto sucks we know you know might say no sucks unfortunately this record really slipped through the cracks for me lappa lux though i do give him credit for coming through with the really interesting fusions of walkie electronic instrumentals and alternative R&B that he does they definitely captivated me on his last record though the singles leading up to this album didn't have me that excited and again just slip through the cracks for me but if you're into that sort of alternative production that brain feeder that Flying Lotus type sound but you want to hear it with a bit of an alternative R&B spin then give this thing a listen I wouldn't say this record is all that catchy or hard-hitting or anything like that but let's come forward with a very smooth sensual left-field vibe I don't know I just could not take another so-so comeback record this this month I was I was just really I was just really at my at my edge with those so um I I just I just I just set this one out though I understand that it's failure and that people want to hear this record I understand that but again just trying out tracks casually from this album I was just like you know what no I just cannot take another soso comeback record I can't I could also not take another middle-of-the-road progressive rock record which is essentially what Between the Buried and Me came through with on this new project over here I that they're trying to mature and gravitate away from the whole metalcore thing on this project and in a way it's definitely more listenable than the technical onslaught that was their last album but I mean I don't really need this gaudy Muse meets Steven Wilson type progressive rock it's just not how I enjoy my progressive rock I don't enjoy my prog rock this clean and this sterile I will say I do think some of the guitar work and some of the drums are really impressive on this album Between the Buried and Me always brings forward some technical impressive playing but I did not like a single song on this album I just did not care for the direction the band moved in with this record and I thought a lot of the clean harmonized vocals were slightly goofy and they didn't really match all that well with some of the you know growly metalcore type vocals that usually show up on it Between the Buried and Me Record migos Atlanta Trio in a way pretty important to the flavor of hip hop today I mean highly influential with their instrumental style with their flows and they came through with a really solid tape I mean there were some great songs on it I don't want to say it's a solid tape but no label - I thought had its moments you know there's definitely a lot of fat on that tape and this album it's not as lengthy but I'm not really seeing how this project over here is any more significant than the mixtapes that they had dropped leading up to this point it doesn't really feel like they went bigger or did anything too ambitious on their debut commercial record over here aside from a few surprised features from a few big names no no no no no I'm really trying to get into this guy's approach to grime and I like the instrumentals on this project I think they're great I think they are grimy I think they are gritty I think the grittiest thing about this record and I could sort of see my way to forgiving the fact that his flow for the most part throughout this project is very similar and always has this quick staccato type of delivery with this raspy just one kind of level of volume and aggression just every word punch it just like this I appreciate the flow I appreciate the technique that he puts into this record but pretty much every song has at least two or three lines that I have to pause the track because it is so funny and not in the way where it's intending to be funny like you are a piece of like an iPhone that is dead that is just like the weakest insult I've ever heard in my life like if somebody with that insult out in sixth grade on the schoolyard you would be laughed out of the school and probably bullied for the rest of your your life like people would remember you at your highschool reunion be like isn't that the the loser that said you're a piece of like an iPhone when it is dead yeah that's that guy this record makes me feel really glad that two eight one four is a part of this I guess widening a vaporwave it's embracing other genres more wholeheartedly and that we're hearing vaporwave that is pulling from pop music and in this specific case pulling from ambient music however I didn't really think this record was all that evocative it didn't really create this sense of place that the cover art and then the description sort of implies that it does though it was a very smooth and and somewhat pretty synth-heavy ambient music record it had its moments but I just I just wish it was more evocative I just wish it was as I guess vivid again as the cover are in the description would imply hans is an experimental music producer this album is free on triangle records give it a try give it a try friends fold an end and the fantastic art pop and glam outfit sparks team-up for a collaborative record for an entire album and it kind of sounds like Franz Ferdinand and sparks collaborating it's kind of weird it's it's weird to get a collaboration where it sounds like such an even marriage of the two bands coming together to make music for the entirety of the record and I think some of the songs on here actually really funny like collaborations never work or the song piss off for the song things I won't get I think humor wise this record has a lot of good things going for it even if at times the humor can get obnoxious and drown out the actual songs on the LP if you try out this Locrian album you're going to be getting some heavy post-metal drones following some very post rock inspired builds and crescendos it's not too bad super heavy super noisy very climactic though a little too familiar maybe at times and familiar as well is this Leon bridges album coming home which I've caught quite a few people making a big deal of over the past few months or so and not that it's bad it's just it just fits too easily into the blueprint of the genre of music it's trying to recreate and relive and that is soul and not just any soul but just like old-school soul music from the late 50s from the 60s from the 70s but more sort of that 50s 60s type and Leon even goes as far as to you know sort of get that old-school production sound going so that it sounds like the music on this record comes directly from that era and maybe in doing that he's taken it a little too far in that it's it's really hard to sort of see him clearly as an artist for the most part all I really here is this pastiche that this album indulges in I just kind of hear okay this just sounds like a revivalist record I don't really feel like I know Leon I feel like I know what he likes but I don't really feel like I know him as an artist he's kind of like pulled together a covers album here except he's just kind of covering a sound covering a style covering an era he's not really covering direct song and and I'm not saying this album isn't quality and that it isn't entertaining I mean if you're looking for a record that goes in that old-school soul direction and you don't mind the singer sounding kind of faceless and anonymous then give this thing a listen but as far as like Leon as an artist in comparison with these other soul artists over the years who he's very clearly copying I'm just having a hard time seeing him you know I'm seeing kind of again what he likes and that's old-school soul but who is he as an artist you know what what is his take what is his sound what is his spin on this style I don't really know all I really hear here is that he is recreating this style and in a way doing it justice but not really you know putting his own name under carving out his own artistic niche within it but he seems to know this stuff like the back of his hand and now that it seems like he's mastered it to the point where he can put out a coherent record with this sound it would be interesting to see him sort of push it a little further and you know just put his own spin on it put his own name on it and those are essentially my records for the y-you know review that's it man you're the best thank you for watching Anthony Fantana music forever 
lZwt3xbuEJQ,hi everyone - any sweat here the Internet's busiest music nerd and this video is a quick little roundup of all the records that caught my attention from this past month that I thought were super good and I think you should check them out too before I get into these records I want to give a shout out to the new Chemical Brothers record the new tame impala record I didn't love these albums but I thought they were very good I thought they were worthy of note and I will link to the reviews for these albums down in the description box but as far as the album's I loved Sleaford mods key markets fantastic duo from the UK this is their most angry cynical poetic and catchy record yet it's a little rock it's a little electronic a little post-punk with these angry vitriolic rants flowing through many of the songs here and they even try out a little bit of singing on a lot of these tracks and it goes over pretty well at least in a post punky angry kind of way so good record entertaining record and yeah I'm looking forward to sort of see what these guys do in the future then I want to shout out the new injury reserve mixtape slash album live at the dentist's office these guys are in Arizona hip-hop outfit and this is their big breakout project I loved it I thought it was fantastic they're like a little bit of a fusion of the cool kids De La Soul future deaths racists they have bars they have flow but they don't take themselves too seriously they have a great sense of humor and I think they're very clever too and good songwriters too because they're killer bucks all over this record so yeah definitely check this thing out it's free so you can download it injury reserve live at the dentist's office very entertaining then a pop and rock outfit from the UK everything everything with get to heaven a really fruity colorful over the top in a good way and just really overwhelming and technical too because the performance is the playing on this album is very strong especially coming from the guitar and the drums some really great percussion all over this record I think the vocals are a little bit of an acquired taste with ah just really nasal really up there in the upper register but I enjoyed them I thought they were very passionate and very emotive despite being so strange so yeah definitely give this thing a try if you can I I don't know if it's released in America yet but if you're in the UK pick up this record or at least find a place online to stream it I think it's top-notch especially the first half man from track one to five man the this record just dishes out one fantastic song after another and finally I was a little late on this one but I still thought it was really enjoyable still thought it was really good another free record to Nicolas jars pomegranates which is a soundtrack to a Soviet avant-garde film you can look up more info on this project on the review I'm going to link down there in the description box and there you go those are essentially the records I want to recommend to you this month and thanks for watching you're the best Anthony Fantana music something transition music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music baby music baby baby whoo girl music music music ah 
qVzscNOR2NQ,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's most tuckered out music nerd ready for a nap but it's time for a review of the new Mac DeMarco record another one Mac DeMarco is a New York via British Columbia songwriter guitarist bandleader who has been dropping sweet heartfelt little bits of indie pop since the days of make out videotape he has a few full-length records under his belt now which have been pretty well received by those who like to take their pop jangly and sort of dreamy but the thing about Mac is that he doesn't always take this easygoing sound as like an out to just deliver like a lazy song or just no song at all oh oh but I wouldn't say this is always the case - most definitely had its weak moments and even more so salad days which I just thought was underwhelming in general there have been Mac DeMarco songs that I love but he's never hit me with a full-length record that I've been head over heels for from beginning to end but I hear that potential in his music I hear it in some of his most fantastic songs I hear it in his production I hear it in his amazing just twangy guitar tone and his really emotive playing - the way his guitars just Sparkle and been all over his tracks so having said all that I was looking forward to this new mini album over here but of course I'm not reviewing this record by myself I have brought on John of a RTV a fellow YouTube music reviewer music critic guy to discuss this record with me transition and now thanks to the magic of the Internet we are here we will hang out in with John a our TV talk about this new Mac DeMarco mini album John what were your general thoughts of this new Mac DeMarco project I'm honestly really liking it it's got some very spirited tunes I would say probably some of the catchiest felt DeMarco is put out the date I had a few problems with some of his past material and I would say probably salad days I know we're probably this agree on that one but that was probably my favorite work from him up to that point and I think he's just further built on that adding in a few extra instruments here and there few synthesizers popping up on this record some nice tropical leaning guitars on some of the jams I don't know it's just a really smooth and easy to digest little mini album so even though it's definitely not a substantial project as salad days or or to you you think generally like as far as like his instrumentation and the way he's writing a song you think he's like improved on all fronts maybe not on all fronts because some of the lyrical content I would say for me on this record is not quite as it's not as worth diving into not that he was ever a super lyrical mastermind or anything like that but on in terms of the instrumentals on this LP I think that he's come for a big time probably his best work today well I don't think he came through lyrically with any songs that like that were super super sticky in terms of the hook in terms of what he's saying on the choruses of these tracks but as far as the verses go I think he's put up some of his most poetic material so far and I think it partially has to do with just how much this album seems to be kind of focused on just love just love songs in general it's a really fun opportunity I would say and more so than anything he's put out I mean there were relationship songs on salad days or even to even his debut EP but still like you said this one is definitely driven my love yeah I mean just either either he's in love with someone or the same person throughout the whole record or she's in love with someone else and the love isn't really a two-way street or his heart Restless like broken um uh for me generally I thought this was an improvement on a lot of fronts to again even though it isn't as large a project as his previous stuff Maran I thought they were some incredibly catchy songs on here and maybe not better than some of my favorite tracks he's put out in the past like my kind of woman usually my favorite Mac DeMarco song of all time but I think this project is consistent yeah that wasn't is anything that there wasn't really anything more than like one done on this record the intro track on here to me felt just kind of like you're your average Mac DeMarco song had like stray twenty guitars so infectious though it's it's one of those tracks that I can't get out of my head honestly since I started finding this record yeah the way you love her definitely stood out to me just its guitar it's not anything super I guess maybe new for DeMarco but at the same time it's got I don't know some sort of irresistible quality to it that I can't really deny it does have that Mac DeMarco charm to it you know I'm not gonna I'm not going to take that away from it and it wasn't a track on here I would necessarily skip I think the only track and heroin skip is probably just put me down which just the way his vocals are just so strung out over this really redundant slow beat just got really tedious for me like even by the halfway point the song it did break things up a little bit because it sounded different than the other tracks on here but it just wasn't doing anything for me I don't know if you have a different definitely I'll honestly bet one of my favorite songs on this hill really yeah it really is just put me down I thought was fantastic I'm really enjoying it he comes off like kind of like the underdog here you feel like you want to be rooting for him he's like it seems to be like in some sort of like oppressive relationship or I don't know having him like his heart is getting played with over and over again like he's getting tricked over and over again I don't know it's just got this kind of spry instrumental on it that I keep pounding like finding myself gravitating towards well I mean moving on from the tracks that I do really love I thought no other heart was like one of his best tracks ever I mean the twenty sparkling guitar leads he puts on his tracker just really expressive and sad and I just like feel bad for the guy on some of these tracks like another one I mean the title track out here I thought was heartbreaking oh yeah um yeah and without me too I mean I thought these were some of his best songs to date not only because I thought the lyrics very poetic and and all of this album really the centers on that love that heartbreak that romance that just desire for love right like I like seeing that I like seeing him I don't you know I'd like you said I feel bad for him but at the same time I feel like whenever he's kind of put in that corner it makes him a more expressive songwriter and another one the title track like you said definitely one of his I guess best written songs on this seize his insecurities kind of taking over him he's kind of like the guy who's stalking his growth he reminds me of someone who would be like looking through this girl's Facebook etcetera looking to see what she's up to he's insecure that there's another person in her life and I I kind of I don't know I kind of like seeing that side of DeMarco coming out yeah it's such a cliches thing to sing about but he just really thumbs it yeah like he's it's it's just he's just really convincing as that guy Brent um and and yeah like you were saying I mean I thought the keyboards all of those record were fantastic just like this really nice Pleasant sweet fat kind of analog sounds this analog thickness to the keyboards I mean there are lots of great analog imitation the keyboards or apps or plugins I don't know what he used I can't suppose that but I mean at least has that kind of thick heavy presence of an analog synthesizer and Mack DeMarco I've always loved his guitar tone and it just sounds better than ever I host record I thought it's an advanced par with some of the most standout parts of this record Tony yeah definitely yeah and some of the keyboards like you were talking about there I loved whenever I was listening to salad days there was tracks like there's one track a Chamber of reflection I believe that had was kind of synth heavy and I was kind of hoping he would do more with that in the future and I'm excited to see that he actually did play around with some of those effects here on the record and the big signs were pretty warm - I'm just like really fit the grooves of these tracks Mac tamargo just has and this is definitely true the intro track he kind of has this knack for I don't know these really weird bumbling like head bobbing certain grooves like to do why it's fun to listen to honestly no other was probably one that really stood out to me in terms of the base work on the hut it was just like it was one of those ones that I kept listening to and that was one of the most prominent parts of the song for me I love how he can kind of integrate like a fun bassline it's not just something that's there something that actually helps I guess bring together a lot of these tunes there's a lot of musical characteristics of these songs that I think are great and yet like it's all so subtle and it's also dreaming that's what I like about bands like each house that's what I like about bands like the radio Department and that's what I like about Mack DeMarco occasionally when he really does it it's that songs are easygoing they're very pleasant but when you sort of put them at the foreground of your mind there's really good song at the core of there too you know songs like another one and like no other heart I think could fit into just like normal pop instrumentation or maybe even like a glam rock song there's something about like these songs that I feel like you can work them into a glam rock record if the singer sort of sat down for just like a really quiet sad ballad for a moment but he's kind of always playing that angle but it doesn't really get that tiring because the songs on this record do manage to be so great and the album physically that long anyway right there were a couple of moments that I found to be a little bit I guess tiring to me uh you know she rested will do it for you well I don't know I'm not going to say that this one didn't do it for me that but I kind of want to point out that on the guitar on no other heart just got a little bit I don't know grading to me over time because I gave this record was so short so I gave it so many lessons and I think maybe the more I heard it maybe I played it a little bit too much for myself but that was one of them and honestly the track without me as one of those like my favorite tracks or your least favorite tracks and I'm kind of flip-flop there on that one that's funny how that works out but it was just I don't know it just felt like you're not stereotypical but just kind of like what I would expect for a melancholy tune from DeMarco alright well I mean I think uh I mean I think I've said everything I need to say about this record I mean I I I don't think it's necessary really an awful album I think it's a bad album I think it's very good it's really enjoyable I think in some of his best tract so far it's just that you know it's a mini outlet it kind of leaves me a little hungry and though I do like the fact that it does feel cohesive and complete and that a lot of the songs kind of have the same musical tone and the same sonic an emotional vibe to them and Mac is kind of circling around a lot of these themes of love and heartbreak and so on and so forth and so it does feel like a complete record it feels like a cohesive record it's not just something to key with a bunch of random throwaway songs Brant it definitely feels in my opinion a little bit more focused in salad days boys I don't know if you'll agree with that even though I know that you like salad days more than me yeah I did like salad days but I would say this is and while the songs aren't really crafted I guess from the same slate there I feel like it does kind of match those expectations that I had going out of salad days transitioning into another one definitely met my expectations there's a lot of break and catchy songs on here it's not that much shorter than a regular demarco project what we've come to expect about 30 minutes yeah okay from him really anything that he's put out so far in this one o'clock sound I think around 24 so they're like like you said it's a short sweet little easy pill to swallow and I thought it was pretty fantastic what are you thinking in terms of writing for this record um yeah I mean uh before I get into that I do want to agree with you on that point I mean they discounted work easy totally swallow I mean as far as like a listen but when you do listen and close through the lyrics it is a little tortured at times too and you know if you're really in tune with that you're really listening to that I think this this record may break your heart as as well a little bit and I think I also want to commend Mac on just generally sounding on this record a little bit more mature than he does sometimes on his records and in a really sounds like even even with the tracks that I wasn't really vibing with I didn't like we didn't sound too silly or anything like that it just really sound like he was trying to flex his songwriting muscle on this record for the most part it came out good I'm throwing a decent strong seven on this thing okay okay well I'm normally on a scale of five over on my channel they are TV reviews but I'll go on your scale for today I'll just your scale to do your scale building it I'm fine I'm giving in to peer pressure I'll do my own scale I'm going four out of five for this record I thought it was like you said you dive into the lyrics a little bit more can get kind of heartbreaking but the more I hear there's just not really in tracks that I find myself really skipping over of course the last track on this thing my house by the water yeah kind of a track that's Barents he gives out his address on it are you planning on going to see him by the way um you know prep probably not gonna go see him but I push I appreciate the invite you know that was nice of him he opened up his house to pretty much everyone he has and you know and that's that's to me sort of maybe one of the things that I think works against this album a little bit I feel like he didn't really have any super grand ambitions for this record and as a result sort of thought this is sort of like a bit of a personal little fan project that only his hardcore fans were in the gravitate toward I think if he you know really tried to make some of these songs pop like he did on to where he has some of his most fantastic singles maybe this record would shine for me a little bit more if he was like thinking more about the crossover appeal of these tracks but I don't really mind this album being it's low-key as it is and I think that you know maybe you saw this album a little bit as like a little bit of a powwow with his fans where they could just kind of you know hanging together listen to these really sort of somber sad Tunes which I've heard is sort of the direction he wanted to take salad days ends make a sadder more somber more personal record but for live reading an interview he would pitch for it like capture tracks wasn't exactly feeling that direction yeah I remember once with that with the making of salad days and kind of with him coming off a tour and being a bit exhausted and getting thrown back and not thrown back into the story studio but I think I feel like capture tracks did kind of player when that and the great and I think I'm I I think the idea of Mac doing a sad or more somber record I think the potential of that and the entertainment of that had greatness of that was displayed on this record and cool to sort of see him take the same vibe take the same instrumentation and I guess string it out into something that wouldn't be categorized as a mini album right Rumpel of a little things that's that he's taking here from kind of record record and while this one does like you said going for it he's going for a different vibe here very clearly it's just that I see improvement consistently across the board with each thing that he's putting out maybe not significant between like something like two and salad days because those are they came together and very similar times on his life and that sort of thing but I'm just kind of excited to see what's coming after this because he does put out records so consistently or at least like an EP or something like that so if we're getting something else next year I can definitely see it being more into Spain and I'm probably going to be on board for it sure so yeah I mean generally I thought this record was good and it's got me excited for whatever Mac is going to put out next sounds like you're of the same opinion Frankenberry yeah that's essentially our review of this record I just wanna before we leave thank John for coming on and saying this piece about this project and I go thank you guys right here on my face in this case when he pops up again to his channel so you can check out his reviews John you want to say you can prove it out oh thanks for having me on the channel Anthony once again good collaborating with you we collaborated on my channel before but it's nice to be working with you on the needle drop then the hopefully I'll see you guys over on my channel - tools - Anthony Fantana Matt DeMarco they are TV use another one forever 
JiMbWIN811g,Oh God Oh hi everyone kathan e futa no here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new titus andronicus record the most lamentable tragedy the tagless and dramatists the deadliest of the dinosaurs um they're a band they're their band from Glen Rock New Jersey delivering their fourth full-length LP with this project their largest and most ambitious album to date and it is 90 minutes long which isn't really a big deal to me I mean over the past few years I have made a point to celebrate large ambitious grand far-reaching records albums like to pimp a butterfly the double Death Grips album they just put out the powers that be Kumasi Washington's the epic Swans to be kind or even the knife's swan song LP ish the habitual the new print album as well there are lots of examples of albums that may not necessarily be easily digestible because of their length but it's records like these that stop at least some listeners in their tracks and they can't help us stand in awe of just the grandiosity and the gargantuous ness of the record just the scope and the aspirations these artists bring forward in their music however in the case of Titus Andronicus though their big presentation and their ambition hasn't always spelled out into mind-blowing records for me take their Punk fueled tribute to America's Civil War the monitor which I don't know I thought it was a little overblown even though Titus Andronicus showcases indie rock and sort of folk and Americana tendencies I think they're ferocious Punk delivery kind of leaves their songwriting feeling OneNote at times and I've had a similar issue with other punk bands that try to take punk music and sort of elevate it to this highfalutin conceptual thing bands like fucked up or even Green Day with the record American Idiot and frontman Patrick Stickles as much as he reminds me of Conor Oberst back when he was just full of so much more piss and vinegar his voice is so growly like a torture victim being forced a gargle acid against his will that his singing kind of grows old for me after a while too and then we have the record local business which Titus Andronicus followed up the monitor with and I like that this was a more measured album but the rough around the edges recording in the lack of exciting songwriting made this record a bit of a disappointment just not as significant as the monitor but obviously Titus Andronicus is not taking a measured approach with this new album over here with it being as long as it is also keep in mind that this record has almost 30 tracks on it almost 30 tracks but with each track here you're not getting a fully fleshed out song I am unhappy to report that this record is chock-full of these completely unnecessary interlude and intermission tracks that are not orchestrated that well just kind of pad out the record kill time and aren't really that evocative either just don't really bring that much to the album many of these shorter cuts don't really fit into the record aesthetically like we're getting these really lavish instrumental bits that don't really fit in with the punker just harder more in-your-face bits of the record and I think some of these interludes really just serve as a distraction to make the record sound a little bit more instrumentally refined and make this album seem like more than what it really is I mean I think Titus Andronicus is really a all force and no Forte no finesse on this record and I think these intermissions are really weak attempt at masking that the only shorter tracks I liked on this record where the very speedy and punky look alike and then the very large vocal piece on their cover of auld lang syne and I guess the song please was kind of like just an extension of the previous song these intermission moments even become kind of laughable when the second half of the record rolls in and we get a minute long intermission of just complete silence on this album as if the previous song was just so huge and so amazing that we just needed a break as if we needed an intermission an interlude track before we get into more intermission and interlude tracks as if this album has been telling a tightly woven musical story up until this point when really this record just kind of sounds like conceptual mess like a friend's indie rock band that was commissioned to write and score a high school rock opera with a very low budget and these interlude tracks take up almost half of this entire records tracklist so the bulk of this album's runtime is placed on the shoulders of these four five six nine minute tracks which can be kind of hit or miss even if these songs feature Titus Andronicus as usual mix of triumph and turbulence these indie and Punk interpretations of Americana and folk rock as well as piano rock which is kind of like an extension of this bar band stick the band indulges in on a few times on this record and they managed to keep a straight face while they do it I have no idea how but I want to give this record credit where it's due and say that there are actually some pretty listenable punk flavored barnburners in the tracklisting here the song dime doubt or fired up or the tracks stranded on my own and even the song no future I like the melodic guitar leads on these tracks I like the type performances the blaring guitars and it seems like there are most definitely Tunes at the core of these tracks too though Stickles sort of seems intent on burying them with his just non-stop vocal contortions and even when he tones it down on songs like lonely boy his vocals come off just kind of goofy nasal and whiny and just not really entertaining though again I want to give credit and I want to say that this track again does feature kind of that dive-bar piano rock instrumentation and there are actually some wonderful layers here the is pretty electrifying at one point and it's cool that titus andronicus is able to incorporate all this instrumentation keep track of it and just have it sounding so ferocious and good the song fired up has a lot of instrumentation laced into it too and it's well orchestrated as rough as the production can be on this record I like that titus andronicus can arrange a lot of instrumentation into a track and have it sounding pretty coherent and the lyrics on these tracks a lot of the time I think are pretty impressive too on lonely boy I'm getting a lot of themes of just antisocial tendencies and just being fed up and angry and just not taking it anymore also on the song I lost my mind which is actually a Daniel Johnson cover I'll be it a very bad Daniel Johnston cover the way that Titus Andronicus just layers instrumentation onto this track I feel like I'm listening to a joke song especially with past Stickles vocals on this track sounding as ridiculous as they do I feel like Titus Andronicus was trying to recreate the same kind of manic ruff just really unkempt demeanor that you might get out of the Daniel Johnston record but weren't able to actually do it in a convincing manner and it just ended up sounding sort of messy and amateurish and unenjoyable whole there's a really strong focus on mental health and losing one's mind throughout this record that ties the entire album together it's obviously the concept and it's actually an interesting concept I commend Stickles on his incredibly personal raw and sometimes sexual lyrics on tracks like fatal flaw and he said she said she said he said however I do think there are times on this record where a bit of fat could have been cut they sort of take ideas and they beat them into the ground to the point where they're just not really that exciting or just have been completely explored like on the more aggressive revisitation of the song I lost my mind later on the record or on the song I'm going insane which is another rough and wild Punk tune that I enjoy but we're just kind of getting these pretty decent Punk Tunes alternating with this excruciating piano rock on songs like mystery man and not only are we getting this excruciating piano rock on this wreck but some of these songs have some of the worst singing I've heard on any titus and dronicus record yet like the song stableboy I feel like do they even care do they even care at this point do they even care that the Vogel's just like sound so bad on this song I appreciate and I'm just trying to give the band the benefit of the doubt and and understand that how awful these vocals are might in fact be playing into the theme and the concept of this record in some kind of way but it doesn't make it any more enjoyable even for somebody who is a longtime fan of emotional wreck songwriters guys like Elliot Smith and Conor Oberst and Daniel Johnston and Simon Joyner and even the Violent Femmes toward the end of the first half on this record we have the nine-minute more perfect union which not only references the theme of this record but calls back to Titus Andronicus as the monitor and this track features a really strong funky melody really lavish instrumentation and it just continues through just one musical passage after another we're often Titus Andronicus will change things up stylistically from Punk to Americana to even a bit of classical music - and it's impressive that the band has this kind of versatility but not every moment here keeps me on the edge of my seat and after numerous lessons of this track the song just ends up feeling like a bit of a clusterfuck kind of like the album itself just not really the fireworks show I was hoping for considering its length and considering it's kind of the centerpiece of the album and then just two minutes away with a little bit of you know just like interlude space in between just like around the corner we're getting another 9 minute track almost as if the two halves of this album are mirroring each other in some kind of way there are a lot of details deeper details in this album that when I read into them from this kind of mirror phenomenon to the fact that the very final track of this record sounds just like the intro track which loops back around to the very start of the album just to everything off you've just heard once again all of these things all these finer weird details I'm very impressed by but just like the song is the singing the core elements of this record just our tour however I will say I do enjoy a lot of tracks on the second half of this record more than I do the first I do think some of the best tracks on this album are in the second half some of the most catchy and melodic Tunes this entire album has to offer are on this half like the song a pair of brown eyes which is a Pogues cover although the very intro of this track is awful the vocals are terrible and very unbearable and the song fatal flaw and the song come on show bond which is easily my pick for best tune on the entire record I'm just not really sure what to say about this album I mean after listening to it numerous times I'm just trying to digest it and and and take in its fine details and and just try to appreciate its concept I mean I've really been trying to give the singing the songwriting the production a bit of a pass because I feel like what Titus Andronicus tried to do with this album was really ambitious was really impressive and was really cool they took a risk and they took on an idea that most rock bands would just not even have the guts to even attempt however I can't ignore that I just don't like a large bulk of this album I think if you cut this record down to the best full songs and maybe incorporated an interlude track here in there here and there you would have had a record that was at least on par with local business obviously a little more grand and a little more conceptual but at least on par but that's not the record we have here the record we have here is packed with filler even a track that in the track listing in the title it says open parentheses filler closed parentheses in the title you said it before me I feel like Titus Andronicus came through with a cool ID and a cool concept here but the music just isn't that great and even though this record does have some flashes in the pan that I give it credit for it's just length makes it so excruciating this is such an excruciating record to listen to yeah I mean this record was super super exhausting to me and just not very fulfilling at all and it at least let it be known that even though I didn't care for this record I'm certainly not you know like super indifferent toward it I felt something I certainly felt something and I I could see people liking this I could see people liking this people who have loved the monitor and stuck by Titus Andronicus through local business and loved the band's more low-five sound on their debut record I think they'll enjoy this album I think they will appreciate this album for its ambition appreciated for its concept and will appreciate the performances and see Patrick Stickles performances as very passionate and aggressive and just really intense which they most definitely are but I think Stickles lack of skill and just his manic delivery on these songs hurts the listen ability of this record at least in my opinion at least for me when it comes to what I want to hear out of an album I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing transition have you given this record or listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think

nzBorXsYJlc,Bethan and yon tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Sleaford mods record key markets the most Punk thing in the UK right now is back with a new record following up their breakout record divide and exit which I thought was entertaining at some parts electrifying but also kind of one-dimensional in a way as well the instrumentals on this record were super minimal very post punky beats mostly consisting of bass guitar and drums and they sound like they're recorded in a very raw fashion as well and andrew fern sort of oversees these instrumentals in live setting as he sort of plays them off of a laptop and then these instrumentals are topped with the rapid-fire vitriolic rants of one jason williamson whose voice essentially sounds like all of the working-class rage in the UK building up over the past 30 years just boiling over in one huge fast-talking angry voice and the mods while their sound was definitely ear grabbing I think it just could have used a bit of variation on this record just a little bit of variety you know just to break things up maybe even just a little bit more a musicality and I think the duo has kind of seen the writing on the wall a little bit that they just can't continue doing the same exact thing over and over and over and have it click with audiences and I think on key markets they have made the appropriate changes Sleaford mods are still there straightforward to the punch angry selves but now they have managed to work in some strong hooks a bit more singing a few beats that actually vary slightly here and there and if you tone down tracks in the instrumental - that are just as engaging as the hard-hitting cuts they haven't really changed anything that was always good about the duo but I think they've done on this record is they've made their very dense abrasive style a bit more digestible and and delivering tracks that actually sound like like songs like tracks like I'm not just listening to these angry working-class rants and there just happens to be a bit of background music going on back there the mods have progressed but stylistically I think they still showcase a lot of the same influences they've always had clearly there is a hip-hop influence going on here I mean not in like a really clear sense not in the traditional sense but there's something so lyrical and poetic about what the mods do that just reminds me of rap music in general there's been numerous comparisons to the fall with this duo and and that still rings true here and also in a weird way experimental spoken word and electronic music duo suicide but all comparisons aside what you're going to hear on this record is is angry it's hilarious and it's catchy right from the get-go with the song live tonight which is a really weird and odd portrayal of like a live setting like a live show and there are all these cynical sort of images and and sort of satirical shots taken left and right at concert goers and venue people even a moment where somebody's handing out refunds and then right after that we get the song no one's bothered which actually features singing for like the duration of the track is about as close to singing as you're going to get from the Sleaford mods and is actually an incredibly catchy song and I get a really strong theme off of this track when it comes to complacency which Sleaford mod sort of seemed to fight against in every way that they can on numerous tracks star out their discography just spitting in the face of crap labels crap music crap musicians crap venues and crap politics before I go into the whole crap politics part I do want to say that the song tarantula deadly cargo actually features quite a bit of singing too I mean these tracks where the mods are really trying to sing more I think they go over well even though this track does feature one of the weirdest stories on the entire record which involves everything from excrement - deadly cargo being dropped off by like extraterrestrials and the mods make this song feel a little less lonely with the fact that we have the song the blob on the very back end of this album which is another very weird tale to be coming out of this duo's music which is obviously a huge nod to the classic horror film the blob if I'm somehow missing out on some kind of big English inside joke right now please let me know Jason really seems to be branching out with what he feels like he can approach lyrically and for the most part I think the results are good he's approaching some interesting and weird topics that while not maybe some of the most amazing points on this record it does show that there is some experimentation going on here the mods are taking some risks they are kind of dabbling outside of the the typical stuff that they would rant about on earlier tracks and at least it's memorable and adds to the character of the album overall I actually think this track is a pretty good example of the mods proving how one-dimensional they aren't while sticking to the blueprint that has got them to this point to begin with but as far as the crap politics go that are constantly referenced throughout this album the mods are still steaming obviously from the elections that just happened in the UK and take numerous shots at not only the system but also it guys like Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband who they say was hit with the ugly stick on songs like face to faces fantastic track and quiet streets as well amazing song and the song Rupert trousers as well where I kind of feel like coming through in the vocals and the lyrics to this real strong sense of just disillusionment and disenfranchisement sort of like the mods are impersonating the very lethargic and just I don't care anymore I'm just beat down by the system just general population that they're trying to rile up with tracks like these to go back to the song and quiet streets some of my favorite lyrics on this entire record pop up on this tract not only in sort of weird one-off little one-liners like eucalyptus you can fuck off but also on lines like we are the wooden horses on wooden race courses and a seizure isn't a physical crack it's your body trying to take itself back from rules I also love the hook on the song Arabia - it just seems like a direct shout-out to the fans talking about how jason has sort of this I don't know this cavalcade of weirdos that have dreams that sort of are in tune with what's Leaford mods are doing and even though there is a bit of a glimmer of hope and knowing that there's someone else out there just seeing how just boring and uninspired and shitty the world can be sometimes even Sleaford mods hatred and their critical eye is turned toward themselves during moments on this track where we get the leer I'm just a little asshole blowing smoke before Sleaford mods were definitely funny and they were clever and they were angering to when they needed to be but now I think on on key markets they're they're bordering on poetic they are poetic and this has helped them deliver more potent verses and character portraits - like on the song Bronson 6 where we're kind of getting this depiction of this very unlikable pretentious music leech scenester type so yeah there's lyrical variety on here and even though the instrumentals do run simple throughout the record I think we're getting some sonic variety - I like how on the song silly me we're getting this gurgling synthesizer a slightly more synthetic instrumental overall and we're kind of getting this slower more lumbering just more toned down instrumental the mods do a good job of handling a slower pace on a lot of these tracks there's only a few cuts here where I feel like the the slower instrumental conjures up very little in the way of chemistry with the vocals kind of like on the song cut make it up or to an extent Ruppert trousers even though that song slowness and its stiffness and its lack of passion seems very purposeful but for the most part the instrumentals here just have these really awesome just rough very amateurish but and enjoyable rigid pumping grooves that just keep the pace of the album high keep the base and the momentum of the album going and that's basically what I think of this record I think it's good I really enjoyed it I think sleeper mods came through on this project and in a way I was kind of expecting them to I was hoping that they would and I feel like they pulled through and I had faith that they were going to do something cool with this next project and that while dividing exit was good it had its moments that there was so much more potential there there was more room to experiment but still kind of stay true to what Sleaford mods have been doing since records like austerity dogs so yes like in this record recommending this record feeling a light eight on this record transition have you heard this album did you love it did you hate it and this so why also what should mr. Fontenot review next on the needle drop just like mr. Fontenot I too have my own music channel however compared to his that has much more hair and much less insight if that sounds good to you then please come and check stereo the music reviews out for yourself there will never be as good as the needle drop I mean what will be I spend more time on this channel than I do with my friends and family anyway that's it from me Jonah Hill look-alike whatever this album was called forever 
_exc0-Ah5sU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Hopson album pound syndrome in way what what he happened what in a way what what he happened what in what he happen he Hopson yes he Hopson he have seen way this is the latest full-length record from funk volume artist Hobson who has been a pretty polarizing figure in the hip-hop community for the past couple years with his mmm inspired lyrical style his music videos which have a really kind of kooky cartoony style to them as well as his very confrontational bars lyrics where he comes off incredibly critical of the music industry of rappers of complacent and lazy music fans and listeners even people who are close to hops and friends and family when they don't sort of live up to his own moral expectations and on his own tracks he comes off sometimes sort of judgmental sort of preachy which doesn't marry all that well with his childish personality which is weird to think that he has because I'm I'm like the same age as him it's not really that surprising to see that over the past couple years a lot of these criticisms have been thrown right back into his face by music fans who sort of see his point of view as maybe a little off-base or maybe think that some of the points he tries to make in his music are a little cringe-worthy however though he is still followed by some pretty passionate fans who think that Hobson is sort of like this really fantastic bullshit detector in the hip-hop industry right now he is calling out labels and artists and just listeners and everybody on their crap these fans find his songs relatable they find them inspiring motivation and in one breath I appreciate that Hobson is the kind of artist who tries to lift the wool from our eyes and just let us see the light and let us see things for how they really are but in another breath I kind of feel like the observations he makes in his music are so painfully obvious that they're not observant at all and often his short-sighted solution to the problems that are ailing the world is to basically agree with whatever he is pushing forward or just think whatever he's thinking then the world would have a a million Hobson's that's exactly what we need and usually I'm pretty lukewarm on his instrumental choices as well but all that aside I think Hobson is a passionate artist I think he can rap I think he can write and I respect that and that is why I decided to give this latest record over here as follow-up to his last album noch madness which I did not like at all a-and I don't know despite references on this record to Hobson kind of half-assing his last record a little bit and he didn't really know what he was rapping for and and just I I guess the the really headstrong mentality that this album comes through with right at the start like Hobson is really gonna like give it to us this time this is the Hopson we've been waiting for despite all that build-up I think that he's only come through with like a slightly just ever so slightly better not madness this time around still the same sort of delivery personality point of view and a lot of just miraculously painful moments to though there are tracks on this record that I like I like the song Fort Collins which is a story track about this moment during the Nok madness tour when the fame and the pressure were really just barreling down on Hopson and he decided to just completely skip out on this live show and I love how they incorporate dizzy right on this track where he sort of comes in to tell his side of the story which I thought was really smart and a great artistic move and even though the song crowned me came through with some pretty lowbrow punchlines I thought the was catchy give me that ground and the speedy flow on this track was pretty impressive too I think sometimes Hobson's passion and his abilities occasionally come together in a really great way and and captivate me even if just for a short while on this project and that's about it for highlights for me on this record going deeper into the album we have some cuts that I think are are not really that great aren't really that terrible they're merely passable like the intro cut like the song forever ill or the song mr. Jones mr. Jones and me I it was actually that song I wish a bunch of tracks were Hobson's is just generally braggadocious and is focusing on his rap skills his flow skills and is just kind of focusing on rap music in his career as a rapper but once he starts delving into philosophically deeper topics that's when this record really starts to fall apart and this is just like and this is just like a laundry list of tracks the song no hope we're essentially Hopson is coming onto this track and this song is just like a bitter fuck you to everybody who didn't help him early on and now that he's successful are coming out to just sort of look for a handout and while I do sort of understand his position I understand his point of view on this track he comes off so nasty and unhappy to the point where it doesn't really seem like he's enjoying his victory and even though these people didn't really help him early on and he is successful now he still hates them for not helping him even though he's now in a position where he is benefiting from his talents and it just seems like he's still angry at these people for no reason so Hopson uses this track to lecture these people and he invites the audience in on this lecture like hey come here look at this I'm telling all these people have crap they were when I was trying to get my hip-hop mogul shit going we had the song ill mind of Hopsin 7 which doesn't have one of the worst instrumentals on the record but lyrically this song is like just a religious temper tantrum he hates religion he loves religion religion is hypocritical religion is this religion is that Bubba Bubba Bubba listening to the song is like listening to somebody talk who started YouTube channel yesterday because they just found out what atheism is the song my love is maybe the hardest I've had to pay attention to a love song in a long time and Hobson's sung bars on this track are really just not pleasurable not even for a second the song f:v till i die is essentially like this Bangor anthem to Hobson's come up with this funk volume label which he helped found and if you're not invested in Hobson's personal story or in funk volume as a label then you're probably not going to care about this track I know I don't certainly since it has a one of the weakest hooks on the entire record which is just super distant super drenched and reverb it might as well not even be there and the song Ramona is indicative to the I don't know either the hatred or fear that Hobson has of women which was pretty clear from his last record where he essentially spends the entire song just propping up this effigy of a crazy sex crazed groupie so he can just kind of knock it down and then we have the song fly where Hopson delivers easily some of his most cringe-worthy nuggets of wisdom the entire record and what's funny is that the very end of this track features this like long ugly just completely unlistenable vocal bridge which sounds like it's just a combination of being pitch shifted and auto-tune and it just is terrible it's a terrible vocal like nothing good about the way this it's like listening to auto-tune dying animals and this part of this song not yeah you have to think about this this part of this song is something that happen actually tried to do he worked on this meanwhile the skit on this record no words is essentially a moment where he's kind of just you know jerking off saying that anybody can do this like you know young thug shit this future shit these guys are retarded and they're not even there's not even words in their songs you know I can do this shit let me show you and he he does perform in the way the young thug and in the way the future does on this skit and this is the song he wasn't trying on this is the song he was fooling around on and musically and just I don't know aesthetically it's it's more enjoyable than fly it's more enjoyable than half the songs on this record that he tried on so your joke song is better than most of your real songs on on your album here that's not good not a good look not a good look and the song I just can't is a banger it's the closer track on this record and it's hard-hitting it's not really a bad tune but I just think it's a really fitting title because by the end of the record I just can't is actually a really appropriate description of how I feel I didn't like Hobson's last record didn't like raw don't like this album either but I think it's on this album something finally clicked it just like clicked to me what is going on with me and hops and we're sort of the disconnect is and I think Hobson has a ton of ability when it comes to taking a subject matter and and lyrically being able to stretch it out for the duration of an entire songs really being able to focus on a topic he also has a ton of flow and I think he has taste when it comes to structuring a song - he knows that a song needs to have its respective parts I think he is all ability and no taste he has no taste whatsoever this record is in very bad taste not only in how it sounds but also in the faux philosophical points it tries to make on nearly every track here which goes to show you ability is nothing if you don't have taste because you know you can have all the the reach that you want you can have all the reach all the ability all the reach that you want you can hone those skills until you have more reach than anybody else but if you don't have grasp of anything if you don't have taste then all you're going to grab for when you reach is tastelessness is just not enjoyable this I'm feeling a light two decent three on this record transition you given this record listen if you have what did you think of it did it enlighten you did it blow your mind enlighten you to all these facts of the world did it tell you some real fucking Shack and you know basically teach you that the man who invented college didn't go to college did you hear that shit let me know Anthony Fantana Hopson forever 
ew8Sfrvob2Y,hi everyone good Annie Boitano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new injury reserve mixtape live from the dentist's office injury reserve I'm very familiar with how is is actually my injury reserve when I get hurt cow will be replacing me good thing I'm very careful and and it's not very likely that I will ever get hurt injury reserve is an Arizona hip-hop outfit besson up I'm messing up uh uh these guys have been dropping a series of pretty great singles throughout this year and I've just been hyped for the moment they put out an album or a mixtape it's finally here and I I present to you live from the dentist's office on this project you will hear the musical stylings of stepa J grogs MC Richey with a T and C and also Parker Cory the producer of the group and I just really like what these guys are doing it just sounds like a really cool modern spin on an old classic a lot of live at the dentist's office sounds like some really chill thoughtful laid-back jazz rap especially what stepa is on the mic feeling some strong like Tribe Called Quest vibes but there's nothing about this record that feels like a true-blue throwback or SuperDuper nostalgic or anything like that because Parker Corey's beats have a seriously modern flair to them from the way that he samples to the very rubbery sub bass in his tracks in a way it kind of feels like the stuff the cool kids we're doing when they first broke but kind of like the the next logical step past that like with the weird choppy horn hits all over the song yo or the kind of jazzy but off kilter whatever dude or the weird quirky banger beat on the song everybody knows Parker Corey's production all over this thing is pretty versatile I mean on the song TT KTV we have a bit of an instrumental at the end that sounds like a dead ringer for something James Blake would do there are a few instrumentals here that I think taken over kanye influenced and again we're just getting like some banger some smoother more jazzy tracks it's it's got a good good of sounds and styles as well as a few songs that are just really super low-key and kind of somber and moody I think these guys not only pull from the cool kids a little bit but maybe even no way like - racist or odd future the reason I bring up those groups is that these guys don't really seem to take themselves too seriously and there does seem to be an element of of comedy - to what they're doing sort of like in a de la Sol way as well I would say in a good way these guys are kind of like an update or a new approach to that Native Tongues style it's kind of serious but it's kind of fun it's serious fun and lyrically and just delivery wise as well there is great chemistry between stepa and Richie with a tee who has a way more amped and just like over-the-top approach in comparison to step oh my god and Richie each he kills tracks on this record consistently with rhymes that are just very clever they're funny but kind of reflective and personal - especially on the song whatever dude where he's talking about trying to be a rapper makes reference to how everybody's trying to be a rapper and how yeah I have a buddy up the street he rapped over the 0 to 100 beat it's pretty sweet really funny quotable line where the beat changes up to that instrumental first split second just to illustrate the idea but he's also talking about how people sort of feel and when he's rhyming and performing but then go to footlocker to pick up some shoes and find him they're working and he's just got so much energy on the song everybody knows - and he does just as well on the more low-key somber tracks on this record - like ttk TV and it's just not Richie doing well on these tracks it's everybody doing well on these tracks I think these guys are really great and really versatile when it comes to just doing different songs of different emotional flavors and still coming together with a great track like on TGK TV also washed up and I should also note on these songs that these guys come through with great hooks - and refrains and just like lyrical routines that are super you're grabbing and super catchy whether it be the wish you wish you wish you wish you watched up or the wow wow wow wow-wow-wow um it should be noted on the song washed up this is a really sad track kind of a song about having a hard time finding people who can be dependable and be trustworthy if there are a few chinks in the armor with this record though one I would say there are some tracks that I wish were a little bit longer and I wish just had maybe another verse or two to them just to make them a little bit meteor especially with the song yo especially with the song whiplash which features Chuck Inglish one of the shorter tracks in the track listing here especially on the song snowmen with glass popcorn on the track a fellow Arizona rap artist and if there was one other thing that I thought was kind of lacking on this record is that the songs that are longer because there are longer tracks on here that push far past the six-minute mark a few of the tracks on here that try to go longer maybe end up in a few places that don't really sound that fantastic or they sort of do these beat change ups or make these weird musical transitions that just don't sound that great like the finishing musical moments at the end of snowmen I think just the kind of ethereal be and the weird high-pitched falsetto vocals just don't sow sow sow sounded fantastic to me there's also the song flight which ends the track off which doesn't really feel like a song as much as it does like a bunch of random incoherent ideas strung together that don't really complement each other that well but there are a few tracks on here where when these guys go long with a track length it's fantastic like I hate to keep mentioning this track but it's a great track TT KTV and there's also the song Friday which turns from this really jovial party tune to like this really dark bit of late night debauchery really quickly just with a simple beat change and it tells kind of a story and has a really big theme and concept to it that I think went over really well aside from all that I don't really have that many complaints about this record I think it's a great project I think again if couple songs could have been longer I think a few songs just kind of went into musical territory that didn't sound that great but those moments just kind of felt like you know little weird interludes or add-ons that the songs didn't necessarily need to go into or maybe could have been transitioned into better maybe just could have been composed better to begin with aside from that I mean a bulk of this record is great I mean this is a great hip hop debut as far as a modern new hip hop project I'm not really sure there's not much more I'm looking for I mean while these guys aren't fast spitters or anything like that I mean there's nothing really flashy about their flows they are lyrical in that you can actually listen to their lyrics engage them there are quotable lyrics here there are relatable lyrics here there are emotional and moving and personal lyrics here there are just funny witty lyrics here you could tell they're actually putting effort into their lyrics and a lot of personality and character and charisma comes through on these bars they can flow well the instrumentals are great the hooks are there yeah it's it's not a perfect project and in some senses it does sound like a group that is still in the midst of coming into their own but I think they made at least a great impression on me with this project I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this thing transition have you given this record to listen it if you have did y'all love it as I hate what you haven't then go download it go download this thing go download this thing go download it and give it a listen go download it with your computer use your computer use your computer use your computer
