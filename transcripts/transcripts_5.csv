57r3E3XRNRk,hi everyone cue the Moonbeam and Erie Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new gorilla toss album twisted crystal this is the latest full-length album from New York band gorilla toss a group that has had a pretty lengthy and strange musical evolution in the American underground for the good part of a decade now the band's early works see them blasting out hybrids of noise rock and no wave and post-punk even dance punk and math rock really harrowing freakish and uncompromising records like 2013's gay disco I like the band's attitude their energy the influences they were so obviously wearing on their sleeves but the production and the performances on this thing we're purposefully messy to the point where I think some good ideas were being lost in translation but past this record the band started to bring stronger grooves to the table clean up the production diversify their influences which turned me from curious to captivated specifically on their 2017 album GT ultra a record that saw the raw and overwhelming energy of their previous effort shifted into a throwback referencing some of the most mutant sounds of New Wave and post-punk of the 1980s bands like XTC and Devo art pop acts like Sparks GT ultra in my opinion was a refreshingly modern take on this anomaly in pop music's past and as much as I like the ideas that the group settled on with GT ultra they have been evolving their sound one album after another up until this point I couldn't not go into this album without expecting some kind of change a change that I hope would see them innovating with this style that they were kind of dabbling in with their last record and while twisted crystal does offer a lot of the zany instrumentation and irresistible grooves that GT ultra did it is a far autre listen with the band dipping their toes into much more experimental and psychedelic territory it does kneecap the accessibility of this album to a degree but given the band's past output I'm not really sure if that's something they worry about that much and without washing their sound out as a lot of neo psych bands often do with too much reverb gorilla toss brings a superbly surreal and bizarre sound palette on this one with trippy atmospheres of sour twanging guitars futuristic laser scents crispy percussion and squelchy bass and the presentation of all of it is somehow stranger than it was on the band's last album - a lot of the sounds on this thing sound kind of detuned like there's just something slightly off about the subtly sour harmonization of all the instrumentation on this thing it sounded like a bar as this album pretty much sounds like GT ultra but set in space and on LSD right from the opener on this thing magic is easy I love the slinky rhythm guitar riffs the bow-wow-wow bass the soaring harmonized guitar leads are a nice touch to the song has kind of a tedious pace to it though but the song is still a pretty bold blend of post-punk and art pop and prog rock and even like a something from a really bad cancelled old-school sci-fi television show theme song then there is the cheeky and hilarious Jesus rabbit a very wordy bit of freak pop with bleepy blue pea synthesizers guitar riffs that kind of sound like they're melting as they're being played and lyrics that dive into themes of faith and cult behavior death and space travel I also love the mantra on this hook Jesus Jesus take me from this planet you're the leader I'm your little rabbit sharp witty funny then there is the futuristic blend of funk and electronic dance music on the track meteorological bustling beat groovy little bass line on this thing wild guitars shimmering intergalactic scents there's a lot going on with this one especially as the sequence synth arpeggios and swelling tones fly in is are filling up all the extra space in the song then the track literally shifts into an electronic piece with cycling beats and swirling synthesizers - then there's the strangely stiff hacking machine which does have a very robotic vibe to it but the song eventually does smooth out with some more fluid grooves and an exciting instrumental swell the track pretty much sounds like a dance party for Devo cosplay people meanwhile the song come up with me is maybe one of the cutest and most genuine pieces of pop music the band has ever produced and written the start of the track is a little overwhelming with these tractor beam's synthesizers and fuzz doubt guitar leads but the inquisitive vocals and driving be and cute little bass synthesizer sound like something that the Buggles left an imprint on super-sticky chorus on this track - why don't you just come up with me the equally catchy Jackie's daughter features some bass guitars and drums that feel like they're pulled right out of a Talking Heads track but of course gorillas toss has a very different vocal style on top of it they enhance the instrumental with some very trippy bleeps and bloops and echoed synthetic percussive hits putting music out there that is mind-bending and strange is most definitely a strong and a consistent theme throughout this record and the band really does save the best for last in that case with song green-apple the track kicks off with this trippy desert drone with wailing violins eventually builds in this groovy bassline a rush of climbing guitars the song really sounds like being trapped in a LSD nightmare with three headed wolves howling at the moon and neon colored snakes biting at my legs though the band does kind of sweeten the deal of that vibe with lots of quirky melodies there are a couple tracks on this thing that I thought kind of got lost in their sound play like the tune of the song wasn't nearly as strong as the weird sounds that the band seemed to pack the song with magic is easy and the much too long and one-dimensional walls of the universe retreat was another super short track on the album that I thought also has some of the least interesting lyrics on the entire record - as they weren't really quite as evocative and as out there as some of the other cuts on here and just like GT ultra and a lot of guerrilla tosses past efforts - this is a kind of scant album as well about 30 minutes long nine tracks however I do appreciate that gorilla toss continue to pack a lot of punch and bold and fun and interesting ideas into a pretty short runtime I enjoyed this about as much as I did their last LP I would pretty much say gorilla toss have done it again I'm feeling a strong 7 - a like 8 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it here the best you're the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if the bail is well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana gorilla toss forever 
GN5tigKpQ9M,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new spiritual eyes album and nothing hurt this is the latest full-length album from Jason J spaceman Pierce and the gang under the spiritual eyes named truly one of the most unique and transcendental rock bands of the modern era and their nearly 30-year trajectory as a group has been an interesting one as so few rock bands out there have been able to so successfully embody both the future and the past in their music rock and roll and soul and Garage have always been a foundational influence for Jason Pierce's songs but over the years he's built on those influences with some choir sized background vocals lush instrumentation and dense shoegaze II sonic experiments his humble songs about love lost faith and personal turmoil are often blasted off into the stratosphere with this orchestral sized backdrop of instrumentation then just add a touch of surreal and mind-bending sound play and that is pretty much the secret sauce of spiritualize and we're hearing it again on this new LP but in a somewhat diminished capacity in some respects Pierce does try to make this album sound grand by layering the usual instrumental suspects on top of each other but the production quality of the best and most recent spiritualize Dallben x' is way better much brighter more spacious and panoramic and nothing hurt is pretty dense but it's a lot more narrow in its field of vision which does leave the sound of the album feeling a bit more scaled-down even sonically smudgy at points leaving Jason's very meager voice to get lost in the haze of instrumentation especially on cuts like the prize which is kind of a shame I do think it is one of the better cuts on the entire LP has a very powerful song about love and mortality and I think some of this change could be very intentional for spiritualize Daz it seems very apparent the band are shooting for something that's a bit more toned down sleepy intoxicating an intimate not quite as heavy and powerful and overwhelming and in-your-face maybe Jason is trying to put more focus on the songs themselves as opposed to the instrumentation surrounding them it just doesn't feel like this album is trying to WoW me with an IMAX sized display of sound but rather just woo me into a stupor that's kind of sad kind of druggie but still pretty powerful with these very soft and thick rock-and-roll ballads and some real art rock ragers to these songs the morning after and on the sunshine heap on loads of cacophony just super noisy guitars just building higher and higher and higher sonically over a pretty straightforward garage rock groove very familiar stomping grounds for spiritualize they're really wearing their Velvet Underground influence on their sleeve as these songs very much feel like they're in the spirit of classic tracks like sister right but with way more clarity and harmony it's just exciting bliss it's like listening to James Brown at the Apollo but on LSD then there are these depressing and like I said before intoxicating slow jams which can be pretty captivating pretty beautiful but occasionally muddy to the point where I think it takes away some of the appeal of the song occasionally leading to some flaccid results on a song here they're like on the closing cut sail on through which sonically comes off very flat and gray despite the heaps of instrumentation that are thrown into the mix which includes some droney tones some choir vocals and orchestral drum rolls the song year comes the road is another pretty fantastic ballot on the record but it is hindered by these weird clicking cycling guitar sounds that are some odd effect that really kind of distracts from the tune and isn't quite as experimental or as interesting as Pierce might have thought it was when throwing it into the song this very same sound actually turns up on the opener too but it's way quieter more subtle and I think applied much more effectively again for here comes the road it's kind of an experimental blemish but I still do like the very beautiful and straightforward blend of rock rolling soul on this track quite a bit let's dance is not a bad song on the album though it is kind of predictable for spiritual eyes at this point a linear ballad that gets heavier and heavier and more grand and presentation as it plods along and has a pretty beautiful and harmony rich instrumental finish including lots of horns and some weird laser effects too again nice moment on the album but not anything spiritualize hasn't done before and with a much bigger presentation and better production but honestly the low points of this album aren't even really that low they are relatively enjoyable at the very worst there are a good deal of quality highlights here the more aggressive tracks I cited earlier the song I'm your man which is a beautiful and romance drenched rock ballad in three time a song that looking at the chord progression and lyrics should have been written like 30 times over at this point I actually thought it was a cover at first the sound of the song and just the lyrics it's it sounded so frigging familiar but still it was really captivating it was really beautiful and of course spiritualize put their dense and heavy and harmonious spin on these older forms of rock songwriting for the most part they're doing it as well as ever I love the touches of piano on this track to the explosive passages of drums and harmonized guitars the song damaged is another dreamy and intoxicating ballad in three about being a very broken and dysfunctional and lost person themes that Jason still approaches in his lyrics with a lot of heart the band pairs this song with some very dense and trippy layers of guitars and strings it's actually one of the few moments where these heaps of instrumentation bleeding into one another in a kind of cacophonous way actually benefits the sound of the album quite a bit as those strings the electric guitars and some bells it sounds like to kind of melt together in a pretty psychedelic way the previously-mentioned opening track on the album is pretty great too another testament to jason's love of I guess writing these very somber ballads in three four on this particular album and really that's kind of the bulk of the record it's it's one of the shorter releases in these spiritualize discography 48 minutes or so nine tracks a lot of the songs run out at about four or five minutes no super dense huge powerful gargantuan builds throughout this record either overall I think it's a decent album there wasn't anything overtly bad about any of it but maybe people who haven't been fans of the band up until this point might have a hard time finding anything exciting about this record considering there isn't a lot of intensity and thrills and the track listing here save for a few moments if I was recommending this band to somebody I wouldn't necessarily throw this album in front of them first mostly because it's it's not a very large or a bold statement certainly not as grand as the band's last album even though some people do kind of see that as a flawed record in in their discography especially not their debut especially not ladies and gentlemen vastly superior records to what spiritual eyes have delivered over here what I see this album as is the band sticking to their guns handing audiences what they kind of expect at this point and doing a relatively good job certainly this is one of the more downtrodden records in the spiritual eyes discography but despite the lack of novelty I didn't really dislike the album didn't really have a bad time listening to it was still pretty captivated by a lot of the songs thought the performances and the tunes were generally pretty passionate and beautiful not a whole lot to hate but certainly not much I can say for longtime fans looking for something different or maybe people who are new to the group to not things I can say hey you're gonna freak out over this really honestly I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like feel like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana spiritual eyes forever 
gHCD_yZlqBA,hi everyone anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd you know who it is and it is time for a review of the new black album East Atlanta love-letter this is the second full-length commercial album from Atlanta based songwriter and rapper Ricardo Valentine aka black who suddenly turned up on people's radars back in 2016 with the major label backing of Interscope Records landed a gold debut album with free black however I did not cover or talk about the album at great length because there was just so little on it that really grabbed my attention stopped me in my tracks as instrumentally and vocally the record felt pretty common and trendy for the current R&B field it was still a starter album though so I was hoping that future records would be a bit more bold and distinct that black would grow into his own just a little bit more and show exactly why he has the level of attention that he does but unfortunately excitement for Valentine's music still really eludes me I understand if you're into this because you're really into the sound you're really into the trend you're really into the vibe to the point where you just can't get enough of it any record that sounds like this you're pretty much sopping it up like gravy into a biscuit you're eating the cereal you're tipping the bowl and drink in the milk and I'm not even trying to dismiss the whole trend because over the years it has come out with some great records it has come out with some pretty memorable and distinct artists but this new album pretty much sounds like a faceless and bland blend of weakened Drake and Bryson tiller I could not tell you who made this album if you blindfolded me and a blind taste test I could not tell you who made this record this thing is pretty much above average instrumentals topped with emotionally flat vocals which for an album that is mostly led by singing there's very little in the way of vocal range on this thing and in terms of singing style Valentine only sounds a shade or two less robotic than our boy nev who dropped an awful album earlier this year again for an album mostly based on singing there is very little singing on this record that's actually stunning or even passionate despite Valentine best efforts to work more personal effects into his lyrics his entry into fatherhood occasionally the songs on East Atlanta can be topically focused like when Valentine is really on his Drake shit with these song pretty little fears a pretty dreary track about a failed relationship with Jay Cole following topical suit in the second half it feels like this story extends onto the song disconnect to wear black sort of portrays himself and another person as just being two lovers who are at a romantic impasse a disconnect miraculously this song is actually my favorite on the entire record and features some of the most expressive singing on the entire project the song Scripture seems to be all about blacks change in mood and worldview ever since seeing success in music talking about his humble beginnings in music to saying I wrote this in a hotel the size of a closet just to show you that I could do it just to show you that it ain't much to it if you got your hand out don't be surprised when I look at you stupid where were you when it was me and the music but even in his most braggadocious moments on this song the lyrics are rambly the pacing is slow and the sound overall is still pretty breezy the song structurally is almost non-existent despite the fact that this song is kind of a big flex I'm hearing very little worth flexing on the final tracks stand kind of flips the script on the obsessive fan trope talking about falling in love with a fan and kind of vice versa and likening his love for this person he has in mind to the infatuation levels of a stand it's a fine closer it has a cute little descending melody on the hook but even with this track being one of the steamier songs on the entire record overall it's just pretty mild east Atlanta just feels like another album of Spacey R&B wallpaper because there is just so little about this record that pops out I mean it's listenable there's absolutely nothing on this album that is overtly offensive but there's very little on this thing in terms of memorability - or excitement or thrills and I get that's not exactly this subgenres MO but it's not really all that sensual or intoxicating or sad either it's just like this very grey plane even constant sense of numbness right from the album's opening track unfair which sounds like a soulless R&B robot trying to mimic human emotion over the same subterranean and cavernous tones that you've heard dozens of times on records just like this already the following track loaded gun despite its kind of grim and dark title leaves a lot to be desired in terms of mood and flavor it's got some pretty tight and depressing production I suppose but again the singing is shockingly underwhelming especially in the second leg where it's about as mundane as the lyrics themselves I appreciate the grind he's trying to illustrate in that song I appreciate some of the personal effects that he throws in there but it's not put all that interestingly and his very even in somewhat monotone deliver he doesn't sweeten the deal either I kind of like the heavy bass and the strings and the slow percussion and the droney distant pianos on the album's title track but it's yet another moment on the album where the singing puts me into a bored stupor and this track features future on it which I assumed going into it he would kind of break things up he would bring a little bit more of a change but instead black and future just kind of layer on top of each other for a little bit very little in the way of vocal chemistry their voices don't even sound good meshed on top of one another but I guess at least it's not as comatose and blobby as the called-- feature on the back end of the album the song let her go picks up the tempo of the album a little bit more but without the overly Moody and atmosphere production I feel like the record inadvertently exposes just how generic it is because everything from the vocal melody to the mid paced rap beat is so nondescript that it's like this album is doing everything in its power to be as ordinary as possible I pretty much feel the same way about the song of switch also slightly more up-tempo and comparison with the other tracks here though it does have a slightly chunkier and grimy Irby and why are offsets vocals mix almost twice as loud as blacks vocals on the track balenciaga challenge he kind of sounds like a background singer on his own song again very few tracks and moments on this record that I would say are boldly terrible or subpar but with everything on this album just being so unbearably dime-a-dozen the the whole record just itches at the back of my psyche with just how painfully average the whole thing is I could see other people enjoying this a lot more than me considering just how much of this album sounds are in vogue at the moment but to my ears there's really absolutely nothing on this album that puts black anywhere near the top of this field right now as it seems like this album's intent is more to just blend into the background of alternative R&B than it is to either innovate within it or even write genre-defining songs songs that say this is the sound and the representation and the cream of the crop when it comes to this time this era this musical movement that's that's just that's just not here I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana music forever 
NvbzLQbLShE,hi everyone sleep with any music tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new no-name album room 25 this is the latest full-length album from Chicago rapper poet songwriter singer Fatima Warner aka no-name who built her name up in the midpoint of this decade with multiple features with the likes of chance the rapper and Mick Jenkins a little bit before her breakthrough mixtape in 2016 telephone a tape that featured a smart and endearing blend of hip hop and jazz and neo-soul despite the very low-key and humble sound of telephone there's actually a great bit of power and beauty in the the gentle demeanor of this record and now two years later with the room 25 no name is still not in the mood to overstate her presence with one soft-spoken verse on this album after another quite literally as spoken word and as I said before poetry are a huge influence on no-names whole rap style on this album no-name backs her bars with instrumentals that embody the currently conscious wave of jazz rap coming out of the Windy City and the feature list of this thing sees her knee deep in fellow Chicagoans like Saba Adam Ness Smee no Raven Lynnae and there's not a huge sonic changeup on this album No Name pretty much sticks to her guns maturing and growing in her lyricism and picking some better instrumental some more flowery lavish instrumentals the lyrics throughout this thing are pretty sharp pretty smart full of quotables full of lines that make me go oh and full of lines that make me go there her in the heart and I would hate to say the word instrumental one more time but the instrumental choices on this record are really part of what lights the whole thing up as I said more lavish bolder they're more beautiful they give the album much more versatility than I think telephone had they also give no-name the ability to get a bit more ambitious melodically with her voice - like on the gorgeous cup window no-name second verse on this track is pretty sharp it's like this passion a lengthy breakup screed enhance with some jazzy music box notes some dramatic strings and twinkly harps the luscious vocal harmonies from who I believe is Felix on this track absolutely kill it quit looking out the window then there's the relaxed and string backed jazz rap don't forget about me a beautiful track at a love family legacy death I think no name in a very funny way explains the emotional vibe and potency of the song by saying that at one point on the track that she needs D'Angelo on this one who is obviously a pretty clear influence on the track - if you were to go back to his his past full-length album the super gentle and subtle vocal melodies that no-name brings to the track are fantastic but really it is her deeply poetic lyrics that win me over much of the time I know everyone goes someday I know my body's fragile no it's made from clay but if I have to go I pray my soul is still eternal and my momma don't forget about me and she goes through other family members hoping they don't forget about her to the track Montego Bay definitely one of the more lively and bold cuts on the album prominently features Raven Lynnae right at the start the track has all these angular jazz melodies executed with these scat vocals a killer bassline the groove on the bass is stellar it's top-notch the tone kills it sounds like it's picked - ravens vocals are gentle they're nasally they're cute no names verse on the back end of the song is easily one of the most playful and tongue-in-cheek on the entire record there's even a point where she kind of breaks down and talks about how problematic she is for getting really sexually explicit the only major issue I have with this track though is that it has this sudden fade-out ending after playing out the instrumental a little bit I feel like it could have used a bit more song structure just a bit more something else at the end and unfortunately this is a problem I have with quite a few songs on this album there aren't a whole lot of super strong finishes or quick clean transitions in the tracklist of this record and I know the tunes on telephone didn't have a whole lot of structure either but the album all around felt pretty low Phi and rickety and in very very DIY which it was a part of its appeal part of what made it so cool however on this new album over here it seems like no name has really evolved past much of that amateurish Ness while still managing to keep the sound of this album super organic I'm just hearing a lot of improvements on a lot of fronts and I think that structurally specifically with the endings that there could have been a bit more attention paid the sudden finishes of these songs really only kneecaps their quality when the song in my opinion ends sort of prematurely especially when the tracks have a very chill vibe and sort of breezed by without making that bold of a musical statement even on these shorter tracks no-name does bring some relatively captivating lyrics talking about tracks like with you and regal even the bold and very political blaxploitation to a degree despite how much I enjoy the very current and Afrocentric political themes on the record which I think are super necessary I just wish there was a bit more to the song I also kind of enjoy the super rickety beat and the vocal snippets from a variety of sources placed throughout the track kind of reminds me of something off of an old MF DOOM album despite its short run time though self is an amazing start to this record excellent tone setter with its jazzy instrumental style and no names very personable and cheeky lyricism her sharp wit and her sense of humor are on full display with this song as she's kind of explaining the appeal in a way of this album saying maybe this is the album you listen to in your car when you're driving home late at night really questioning every God religion Kanye pitches maybe this is the entrance before you get to the river I had him before the heathen no reason for you to like me maybe this is your wife he just wanting a clean divorce the baby ain't really yours that's really for babies teething the chicken wings underseasoned I mean she puts it all much better than I do but I love how much care and love and attention she puts into kind of guiding the listener in in a very warm and welcoming way and getting them to think about her music and what they're about to hear in kind of a meta way other highlights on the album include the mystical and groovy prayer song one of the more somber tracks on the album here where no name brings these very grim bars about an empty American Dream juxtaposed against these these wishes these desires to reach out to or maybe be helped by a higher power I'm song part of me Felix kills it once again layering on these lavish vocal harmonies that really kind of steal the show don't even mind hearing the guy on the album twice because he does so well each time he appears benjamin earl turner actually pulls through as one of the better features on the album too with his thoughtful lyrics his expressive delivery some of the flow change ups i did kind of think in my first cursory listen of the album though that like well did kendrick pop in on the is this kendrick he has a bit of a tonality to his voice that reminds me of his though i think it may be him I don't know just kind of a subconsciously borrowing a bit no-name also gives this album a very nice and warm sense of closure with the closing track too though the instrumental is not one of the boldest on the entire record I do think in a lyrical sense she does wrap up a lot of the themes and emotions of the album quite nicely and actually kind of puts me in the mood to just listen through the entire album all over again overall room 25 is a beautiful little project much in the same way that telephone was when it dropped but since then no names music has only gotten more gorgeous more charming extravagant poetic funny and entertaining there are a few underwhelming cuts on here that I wanted a little bit more out of musically or lyrically again some better endings but overall is an album I thought this thing had a great flow a lot of character quality production raps singing melodies no-name does it once again with this brief and beautiful album I'm feeling a decent - strong 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe please don't cry over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantan oh no name room 25 forever 
xedn_lbTJzo,whoo hey everyone dirty crust Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new effects twin collapse EP electronic music legend Richard D James he is back with a new EP in a pretty steady stream of music that he's been dropping ever since he made his comeback with his 2014 album Cyro truth be told though a bulk of what richard has released since he's come back hasn't really grabbed my attention all that much a lot of its underwhelmed me whether it be the sanitized minutiae of Cyro or the very skeletal analog synth sound palette of the cheetah EP there just hasn't been much material that has moved me as greatly as a lot of his classic works even I care because you do this collapse EP however really did stop me in my tracks mostly due to the teaser track to this thing t69 collapse and I was kind of hoping the rest of this five-track EP would just follow suit what's so stunning about t69 is that it's an imaginative texture rich and bustling piece of IDM with a futuristic aesthetic very busy rhythms glitchy synthesizers and multiple compositional phases within the song too for the five minutes that this track lasts Richard does pack quite a bit into it keeping track of every sound and every progression in this cut would be a lot like just reverse engineering a complex math problem the speedy introductory rhythms the rubbery analog synth bass the second third of the track is a total change up presents these really unsettling synth passages backed up by these intensifying rhythms that get faster and faster as they build up the track goes from sounding like this really smart clean futuristic electronic music to complete digital dystopia then Richard returns to a lot of the original music themes in the last leg of the song expounding on them the first 44 is a spacious cut with these very busy and strange rhythm patterns some strange echo drenched vocal samples too honest to god it kind of sounds like something that Death Grips would rock on no love deep web between the really rough synthesizers and the dry complex punchy drums Richard's approach to evolving the track Sanda CP isn't too much different than what he was doing on sciro but these sounds the presentation this time around are pretty much bolder louder and darker too especially when he floods the mix with these waves of sour synthesizers that sound like he's trying to soundtrack a dance-a-thon between the voices in my head the track MT 1 TR 29 r2 is a bit more of a melodic ear worm where the synthesizers take more of a lead role than the rhythms with these stuttering lead synth melodies at the start of the track that are pretty fantastic then some mystical arpeggios that cause a total mood shift at one point in the song it's really like everything the song had built up until that point gets pulled out from under the track in about a minute in and this song actually breaks down to a new lonesome spotlit idea and builds from there multiple times across its runtime and not not in a bad way it's pretty exciting I feel like each shift on this track just gets stranger and stranger I kind of feel like I'm playing a video game and I'm going down to another level into the underground as I kind of plow through this one however on the track abundance 10 edit I didn't feel like every transition was gold here a lot of the shifts especially toward the end of the track where Richard presents this more laid back beat it doesn't really kind of keep up the momentum of the whole song or at least the shifts aren't jarring enough to kind of keep things engaging a meanders throughout the whole second half especially as Richard presents this very Spacey reverb II outro passage just didn't really find the atmosphere to be all that evocative even though it is on a lot of the other previous cuts here I wouldn't say PX is one of my favorite tracks on the EP either though I do think it ends things off on a relatively strong note it definitely features one of the more focused and fluid progressions throughout the EP even with a few jarring ideas thrown in here and there and it may come down to the analog synth bass and the groove of this track but there was something about it that just felt very vintage almost as if he had conceived or produced this track like 20 years or so ago or something which was a little jarring because every other cut on this thing just felt super super contemporary less of a thrilling excursion on this track and more like a welcome return to some familiar territory I guess but overall I thought the CP presented a really solid and enjoyable handful of songs that were really intricate worth swimming into had a lot of sharp and interesting musical progressions throughout definitely my favorite EP that richard has dropped since he's come back I'm feeling a light too decent 8 on this thing transition have you given this EP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're

Wrm_ADic05Y,okay okay okay everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's most nocturnal music nerd you know who it is hope you're doing well and it is time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and worst tracks of the week you know what it is everything I'm gonna be talking about in the video is linked down below in the description box before we get into the tracks of course shout out to our Amazon and turntable lab associate links hit up those links especially that turntable lab link grab yourself a colorful pressing of a record I reviewed or a turntable or some speakers we get kick back from it helps out the channel helps out the segment and in a really quick and dirty fashion let's just get through a few shout outs so first I want to shout out tabby has a new single out titled prequel new project on the way I imagine sounds pretty cool if you like your internet hip-hop infused with a bit of Internet soul it's pretty smooth pretty sweet pretty enjoyable I also want to give a shout out to friend of the show princess Vitara the total total rap queen killing it with this new song about swallowing his kids that's the subject matter of her new song it's a total banger give it a listen I also want a shout out the band Paul Bearer they are included on a new sort of Pink Floyd The Wall Redux project where there's a lot of different cover versions of songs and they do a cover themselves of the track run like hell so if you're into Pink Floyd if you're into the do metal stylings of Paul Bearer make sure you try it out I also want to give a shout out to Liars and tropical fuck storm the two bands have come together for a little split of sorts which if you're a fan of experimental rock then you should give that a try most definitely LCD citizen has a a chic cover out which you can check out it's on streaming services now a rather sound Spotify anyway and also want to shout out finally friend of the show hot dad who has a new funny song out about Elon Musk putting putting cars into space so all right well let's get into the tracks that I thought were the worst this week worst tracks of the week a good handful of them a good handful of worst tracks to go through hopefully I don't I don't need to torture you guys to death with any of these but first off the new 1975 song sincerity is scary was a little intrigued by some of the teaser tracks for their forthcoming album but I thought that this new song over here was absolutely awful like a really terrible combination of their usual pop rock blend with some really cliched alternative R&B with a lot of hideous vocals on it and very gaudy production just again did not care for it at all moving on from their Swizz Beatz has a terrible new single out with little Wayne like not only is the production very stereotypical Swizz Beatz production but the hook is garbage and little Wayne does not sound good on this song like he doesn't sound well he doesn't sound okay and that does sort of make me worry about the Carter five a lot which is coming out very soon the Carter five is as real as happening so I guess keep a lookout for that I will however not be keeping a lookout for any new songs from Swizz Beatz and little Wayne because really lyrically instrumentally on all fronts this was a terrible moving on from their Smashing Pumpkins that they're putting out original material the band is back together sort of partially mostly title of the new track is silvery sometimes open parentheses ghosts close parentheses and I think I think Billy Corrigan's voice still sounds pretty decent but the song and the instrumental are absolutely bland I feel like I'm listening to the generic pop rock instrumental sitting behind Kelly Clarkson's since you've been gone this is not the the instrumental palette that I wish to hear from one of the greatest bands of the 90s like this is a very bland underwhelming instrumental palate and people fucking wonder why why rock is in the ditch right now because the band's sound like this the bands are playing like they're completely gutless if people if you played like this in the 90s people would have ignored you you wouldn't have even gotten on the radio no nobody would have even acknowledged it it would have been totally just thrown under the rug no no one even knows it exists however people are just like oh I'm glad they're still doing things in 2018 and it's just like no I'm not applauding for you know the fact that you're able to keep it up after you popped a few viagra I'm not interested not interested the song really this I'll leave it like this the song really does does this feel like substandard pipe moving on from their Rosten Vampire Weekend Fame still dropping new music still a painfully boring and mediocre washed-out balladry the vocals are a little better though there is that and called-- sounding more underwhelming than ever on his new single better it's it's just really uh sorry about the switch there it's just really a nondescript and and I have no idea why people get hype over this it's it just sounds like R&B elevator music yeah and it's not not not that not that interested in this alright let's get into the tracks I thought were kind of meh not terrible not amazing but certainly worth pointing your attention to starting off with this brand-new song from none other than sound sculptor extraordinaire mr. Tim Hecker he has a new album on the way we have talked about music from this forthcoming record before this newest song is titled keyed out not too insane about it it's a very experimental elektroakustik blend with some very odd synthesizers that don't really mix into the instrumental all that well the sounds generally across the track are really disjointed and don't come too they're into a tight emotionally potent swell or I guess loose composition as I can typically expect out of Tim's music just just felt again very fractured and and not in the best way though still all pretty much all the sounds that went into this thing very bolds the sound play is pretty interesting just compositionally though it's a little flabby and indirect I guess we had this other track from Naja a dois dua and it's it's a pretty futuristic and a passionate piece of modern soul just really good vocal performance on this thing a very wordy and thoughtful lyrics that are pretty cool so definitely enjoyed that aspect of the song moving on from there Marc rebo has a new song out with Tom Waits obviously with the billing of this upcoming record of his songs of resistance we're getting a little get a lot of political over here as Tom Waits is singing about fascists on the song it's a very dramatic ballad not one of Waits's a better vocal performances but it is a pretty captivating tune with some very old-world instrumentation that that's pretty beautiful moving out from their low Rome a new song from the band's latest record which I am pretty excited to review as it sounds like one of their most sonically experimental and adventurous albums yet this new song over here didn't really blow me away like some of the other material I heard from this album but I am very much open to this song growing on me in the context of the album again the sounds just way more abstract than you've ever heard on the spans albums before it's actually kind of like they're in all new bands so if you've never really gotten until those music before if you are into sonic experimentation ambient music really patient stuff I think you may dig what the group is doing on this a new set of songs on this new album next health and soccer mommy team up on this new single mass grave you know it kind of reminds me of some of the electro goth music that was coming out of the mid to late 2000s that was pretty cool and and health certainly contributed to some of that in their own way I guess you could say the song is is maybe a little bit of a throwback to some of health's Dancy R singles back in the day though I didn't think the tune and the the lead vocals were a little underwhelming I did think that the instrumental was pretty bitchin and there were a lot of cool things about it moving on from there soap and skin new track out make sure to try that out not as lyrically intensive as her last song but there was kind of an endearing cutesy tone to the tune that was very different for soap and skin generally her songs are are typically pretty grim and heavy and atmospheric and and dark and there were some elements of darkness on this new track over here as she again writes these very dreary art pop tunes but this new song over here it was actually somewhat heartwarming and quaint so kind of a nice emotional shift for her and daaad straight black metal band that grabbed my attention a few weeks ago within an animalistic single that I covered in this series this new one over here that I want to tell you about a drowning voice is not nearly as multi-phased or intense from a performance standpoint but it's still a pretty decent cut still a decent cut give it a shot and Sierra has a brand new song out titled DOS feel like a decent piece of mainstream pop pretty tasteful pretty forward-thinking lyrics and everything even though I thought the instrumental was a slightly generic and buchen case are back they've been dropping new material if you're familiar with them they are known for literally recording albums with their custom instruments the buek and the gase and yeah I mean they come through with their usually intricate complex technical and sour unresolved sound though I wish there was a bit more resolution on this new song over here as it does feel like just this endless tension ride that that doesn't really pay off at any point but still it is a it is an intriguing listen I guess this new track over here pink boots and I want to give a shout out to jazz saxophonist Donny McCaslin he has a new track out featuring none other than Sun Kil moon slash mark kozilek and it's a cute crossover Donny essentially comes through with this jazz sort of funky jazz fusion background instrumental and then mark of course on top of that is doing his lyrical thing where he's going off on a story or a diatribe or whatever it just sounds like a mark kozilek song with a jazzier background I don't know within the greater context of Donnie's album over here like what this song really will add to the to the whole thing but still it was pretty interesting to hear mark in another context and basically doing what he typically does with with another artist because what he pulls off here just seemed so personal and so specific to him in his albums that it's it's sort of mind-boggling that somebody would want him to just like do it on on their shit which does give me hope that one day we will see mark appear on a rap song which I would like it to be in such a way where you know you have an intro you have the first rapper maybe it's a group maybe it's run the jewels you know LP comes through killer Mike comes through like crazy and trow bang or be verse chorus verse chorus and then comes mark and with any other feature or with no feature the track probably would have ended at like three minutes and 40 seconds or so but then mark goes on like this eight minute story like over the same instrumental and I would and and then it finishes and and that's how that that's what I would like Mark's first major contribution to a large and and popular hip-hop album to be that's that's honestly what what I would like sorry for going on that diatribe but it is my wish and let's get into the best tracks this week the songs that were the most exciting to me first off I have to shadow of course the brand-new Eminem diss track at Machine Gun Kelly absolutely eviscerated the guy on this new song over here I talked about it in a lengthy track review on the Fantana channel you can look that up but I thought Eminem's flows on this thing we're solid beat was pretty great and the lines he came at Kelly with were just just so mean just just so not nice the machine gun man bun line the rhyme about him being willing to suck dick to be Eminem talking about facts like his highest points are not even gonna come anywhere near m'aimes lowest points and Eminem is essentially giving him a career to destroy it by coming out with this track it is a nasty diss track the the haters of course will not like it no matter frickin what and that's fine but I think the song was funny it's brutal it's hilarious it's smart and most importantly I think it really puts one of the goofiest rappers in the game in his place and that's it all right Lana Del Rey I praised her new single on the Fantana channel Mariners apartment complex thought her vocals and the instrumentation on this new track were beautiful and tasteful and yeah kind of captivating sounded like a slightly more mature Lana Del Rey looking forward to kind of seeing where this new record takes us and she's teaming up with the bleachers guy you know this time around the bleacher the bleachers guy the bleachers guy all right moving on from there Kurt Vile full Crocker extraordinaire indie folk rocker extraordinaire he has a new album coming and a poopa dupa new album coming out new track is titled bass ackwards and it's a cute little Spacey folk rock tune with a pretty wordy narrative vocals it actually reminded me of him going in a kind of like a mark kozilek direction a little bit with his lyricism which I which I thought was pretty cool moving on from there a Colella has come through with a remix of the song LMK or let me know with a princess Nokia jungle pussy and cupcake and it's a banger it's awesome amazing to hear these women kill it on this refresh er of this great track from Colella so enjoying that jouji has come through with a single that I praised this past week - the title of the new thing is slow dancing in the dark and what I'm mostly enjoying from this is that for Joji it is both a vocal and an instrumental improvement definitely much more passion energy and excitement so pretty moody still pretty low-key as far as like overall delivery but the vocal performance the singing was measurably better and it's really cool to hear him progressing as an artiste moving on from there wake up in the sky without with Gucci Mane Bruno Mars and Kodak Black is actually a pretty gratifying piece of pop rap Bruno Mars kills it on the versus Kodak Black is a little more melodic than usual Gucci Mane is pretty catchy - the least impressive thing about all of it is the instrumental but at least all three of these guys are charismatic enough to make up for that wake up alright a dose your dreams fucked up new album on the way Canadian hardcore punk band usually pretty overwrought and annoying as far as their songwriting style goes but truth be told this new song over here house of keys is a pretty direct sonically interesting and very rough in aggressive punk-rock barnburner and enjoyed it quite a bit so shout out to fucked out first fucked up song I've enjoyed in a long long long time it's been a while it truly has and fiddler fiddler has a new track out which is it pretty pretty edgy and pretty political for them not usually getting a whole lot of political music from fiddler but this new song over here - real does have some kind of obnoxious vocal effects at the start but I feel like it immediately makes up for that with just a kick-ass song that's a pretty revolutionary as far as I guess the tone is and the message dolly parton insya team up for a new single which is slated to be on this upcoming film soundtrack for a film named dumpling I believe it's titled it's it's about a girl who's going through some body-image issues and she kind of Revere's Dolly Parton in the film and so it's kind of interesting that they would get dolly on the soundtrack and on top of it have her in a duet with SIA and then on top of that had the duet kick ass because um yeah it's just kind of a beautiful tune great pianos powerful voices I know Dolly Parton was a great singer but didn't know at this age could she still kill it and she does and again up against a very talented singer herself SIA you know seer SIA vocally speaking is is no slouch so you know you can't discount SIA moving on from there I think this is the the last track that I wanted to shout out this final one over here is the latest track from Adrian linker of big thief Fame if you guys know I've never been a big thief guy was kind of underwhelmed by the last record that some people seem to be really hyping up however her acoustic solo stuff over here for me is really kind of hitting the spot like the finger picking on this track is impeccable and kind of hypnotic gorgeous vocals are great it's very subtle but the melodies are our super quality and just loving how intimate the recording of this song is to definitely offer this song looking forward to her new full-length album gonna gotta be psyched to kind of hear what's on the rest of that and that has been the weekly track round up everybody thank you for watching it's your boy Anthony Fantana hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this all of the songs that we talked about again are linked down there in the description box I will see you in the next one forever 
18NbdIPrMLo,yeah hi everyone litany hair tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new ruffs albums ooh new jersey rapper songwriter producer Russ he is back with a new album since dropping his breakthrough record last year there's really a wolf musically speaking 2017 was a pretty huge year for Russ but while his album was doing numbers and going platinum it seemed like he was gaining attention for all the wrong reasons in numerous public statements he just took a really confrontational tone with the current state of hip-hop which put a lot of eyes on the guy but didn't really do all that much for his public image and it's not that I think this new wave of hip hop and trap music are above critique I make it my business to do that on a weekly basis and I'm still here but what I think Russ isn't really appreciating is who's the messenger here and and what is the intent of that message because Russ is not coming at the genre with the experience and the classic discography of a vet even though he has quite a few projects under his belt he's really at the point in his career where he's just kind of getting started and why should anybody listen to you just because you rap and produce and you have one platinum album it doesn't make you God's gift to the genre and it also seems like a lot of his critiques on this new wave come from a really awful place sometimes he's deriding the drug culture in the genre at the moment sometimes he's attacking a perceived lack of talent or authenticity both of which seem driven by this very obvious bitterness over not being welcomed with open arms into the current state of hip-hop which is really odd because technically speaking it's not like Russ is all that much better topically he's only a shade less materialistic and even chauvinistic than a lot of these other rappers that he's making fun of the song from a distance is all about him rapping and singing about this girl next door who he's like continuously cheating on on the road and basically expecting her to just sit there and wait for his short ass because he needs time to adjust to being famous and believe me you'll never go too long on this album without hearing Russ brag about how much money he's made his mansion how he's buying his family houses he's taking care of everybody he makes this he makes that he has this he has that you cannot continuously throw shots at this new generation of rappers while simultaneously being mediocre at best yourself and to go back to Russ's previous attacks on drug culture it doesn't really seem to come from a place of sympathy for addicts or addiction it all just feels like an extension of his superiority complex which he just can't seem to get ahold of now listen I wouldn't normally go this deep into the personality and the drama surrounding a particular artist before I get into talking about the music that's actually on their album but the problem is that Russ also uses his music as a platform to blow off steam about the hate he receives for being a hater the closing track flute song outlaw kill them all there are numerous songs on this record where Russ is just going off about other young rappers being dumb and ignorant drugged out and materialistic the industry journalist saw the lies told about him the hate the pressure his lone wolf status he even drops a bar on this record about other rappers playing the same festivals he does but when they see him in person oh you guys talk on the internet but you don't do nothing which is a line I could have passed or taken in stride had my review not come after this recent story of him sending people he knows to beat up smoke perp just because you guys have liked some online rap beef it's pretty weak to hear tough talk from somebody who needs to send other people to hurt their enemies for them because that they can't do it themselves honestly the attitude that permeates a lot of this record isn't too unlike that of Eminem's recent album kamikaze an artist who's found themselves in the midst of an incredible amount of success but they're still angry at the whole world and they are gonna take their anger out on everyone except Russ doesn't have any of the hits the Eminem does nowhere near the same skill level or tale' he doesn't even really have a unique voice or rap style or production style even though it does lead to some of the more aggressive and compelling moments on the album Russ really does waste too much breath attacking these flavor of the month rappers who are going to disappear in the next five years whether he comments on them or not which is why it is hilarious projection to hear Russ ranting on this album about all these journalists and rappers artists hating on me for the clout meanwhile if this new wave of hip-hop didn't even exist what would you be so angry about where would you be what would you be doing I can tell you one thing if this album didn't come out I would review another album I'd still have work to do but if Russ didn't have anyone to hate what would he be doing well he would most likely be dropping gentrified lovesick pop rap tunes like the track missing you crazy or boring bland pillowy luxury rap on the track lasts forever with Rick Ross and Snoop Dogg at his worst on this album Russ just jams these buttery bops that sound like if Drake didn't have any personality or the ability to write a mega hit when he's tolerable it kind of sounds like he's throwing it back stylistically to the late 90s the flows are above-average the beats are very polite but they boom and bap a little bit occasionally there's a clever bar he sounds a little angry seems like he's kind of enjoying himself getting back at his haters certainly tracks like outlaw and killed them all are pretty cool if I ignore who the music is coming from and to add to that I was legitimately captivated by the track park stone drive where Russ does spit some compelling bars about how money Fame and a bad marriage between his parents were kind of tearing his family apart it's easily the most respectable expression of emotion on the entire record however a handful of likable or tolerable songs do not prevent this Titanic from sinking because it is really weighed down in a lot of awful and boring songs not to mention Russell's crummy mindset because honestly there are a lot of rappers out there they get clowned for being corny guys like logic and Jay Cole G easy Hopson Drake Joyner Lucas to a lot of these guys more talented than Russ being made fun of more than Russ however they've somehow managed to taken and stride and handle it with more grace this is a very tiresome and self-centered album with very little in the way of an appeal outside of people who are somehow invested in Russ's struggle or have somehow been tricked into thinking that Russ firing back at his haters qualifies as smart social commentary meanwhile the popular tunes on this record just sound like hip-hop music for people who write that they listen to everything but rap in country in their dating profile I'm feeling a light two DS and three on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the belt as well Russ zoo forever

u0q5KiNtTbE,hi everyone floss every day here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the brand new suicide boys album I want to die in New Orleans this is the long-awaited debut commercial album release from the Louisiana hip hop duo suicide boys scrim and Ruby joined up under this name in 2013 and it has been an endless string of releases from both of them since numerous mixtapes and an almost countless string of EPS motional which dropped in 2017 alone if I'm not mistaken for whatever reason the boys have just preferred to drop a bulk of their music and these three to six song bits which is fine but I didn't really have a lot to say about a majority of these EPS as a bulk of what they release was pretty much just the duo continuously spinning their wheels and this revivalism of old-school horrorcore and memphis hip hop giving nods to everything from old-school three 6 mafia to underground obscurities like blackouts dreamworld tape delivering to audiences a lot of dark and murderous and blasphemous lyricism parsed out into these rippity dippity rippity deputy rippity dippity triplet flows the suicide boys formula is pretty obvious at this point whether it be because you've heard some of the duo's previous EPS or you're familiar with the classic hip-hop albums that the duo pretty much used as inspirational source material however I want to die in New Orleans is maybe the first project from both of them that sort of stopped me in my tracks where their usual predictability didn't get to me quite as much and they actually managed to grab my attention for more than a track or two mostly because it felt like the vibe of this new project over here was a bit more distinct and freakish and in-your-face and not merely a near anonymous group embracing some old-school Memphis rat pastiche but even though I think this album is pretty decent I think a majority of its peel is just sort of skin deep for me this thing has a supremely dark and grimy vibe very rough textured eerie and aggressive production the flows on this thing generally are pretty tight it seems almost as if there is a slightly larger focus on hooks with this project to some of which we pop like on the track nicotine patches one day I or one more that really stood out to me save me from this hell let me rest a bit some of the melodic flows on the track Phantom Menace are really sharp the rumbling beasts and dirty drums on that track add quite a bit to its appeal too but there are still a lot of very glaring shortcomings with what suicide boys bring to the table here lyrically it's pretty surface level with a lot of references to drugs and violence with a slightly edgier presentation than what you would catch on any other rap record that approaches these very same topics and the appeal of the lyricism doesn't really come down to a sense of humor or skilled wordplay but instead being really morbid and grim and sometimes it does work like on the track where time all the time where it seems like the duo are writing from the perspective of a mass shooter who is also an ex-soldier who is addicted to drugs and suffering from PTSD not really an angle you hear all that often and a lot of the duo's other lyrics also feed into these very authentic and potent and consistent themes of depression and isolation also kind of embracing their outsider status in the rap game but simultaneously there are spots on this album where the lyrics can't come off a bit too edgy or tryhard or basic maybe even juvenile especially on the track mr. nice-guy where some of the darker and more violent themes throughout the group's lyrics also get mixed with some romantic bits and it's a really awkward combination and on top of it for music that's obviously trying to build on the spirit of horrorcore the album ear it's it's not very cerebral it's not incredibly frightening I do give it kudos though for just oozing pessimism and negativity there truly is nothing nice or friendly about this record so even when this album is lacking it at least has that going for it I guess another major downside to this project is that a lot of the songs on here are super short lacking in structure I don't know what it is about a lot of these new Memphis rapper vibe lists where they just have this need to slap together an intro a verse a chorus and then end it or in intro to verses and then just end it if you've got good flows and some great dark production it can bring a strong vibe but in terms of songwriting and memorability it doesn't leave that much of an impression especially when you're killing almost 20 seconds in your own song by just rolling through a very faint vocal sample from another track in between a couple of verses something the boys do far too often on this album to the point where it just feels like they're using it to fill out tracks and it's certainly not a replacement for a hook or actual songwriting but I guess the upside of all of these songs feeling very vibey is that it comes together as an album into a pretty seamless listen but then the downside of that is a lot of these songs tend to blend together I mean I can kind of see why the duo have an aversion to longer songs with more structure because some of the tracks on here that do exactly that are a few of the most underwhelming on the entire record like the track Carrollton and the 7-minute closing song I no longer fear the razor guarding my heel which has it's bright spots but it mostly just feels like a bunch of random songs that could have been placed earlier in the tracklist mashed up into a long song as the first two and a half minutes of the track feel like a song then it transitions into another two and a half minute song then there's another transition from there into an outro it just feels very disconnected as there doesn't really seem to be a guiding theme that brings these different tracks lumped together into one track together yeah overall I think this album is pretty likable but it's not very standout and I think these suicide boys continue to punch under their weight on this thing which is a shame because there aren't a whole lot of groups out there doing this sound reviving the sound and doing it well and even though I enjoyed quite a few tracks off of this project I just don't see how suicide boys have really evolved that much artistically since they first started turning heads on SoundCloud and they've certainly had plenty of time to advance certainly as much time as other artists who started in a similar area in a similar time and we're also influenced by some of the same artists they were Denzel curry hopefully now that the duo are putting themselves out there and taking this risk by embodying their sound into an album they are ready to kind of turn a page into a new chapter and kind of grow and mature what they've been doing here a little bit and bring audiences an album that might have a more refreshing sound has a bit more conceptual weight or a bit more forethought I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry over here next to my head is another review you can

bPV43b1N32g,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for another edition of the why you know review where I go over a series of records I didn't get a chance to review full-length style over the past month talk about them in a series a series of mini reviews a gauntlet of mini reviews you know what it is at this point I hope and yeah that's it let's get into it ba-bam here we have the new Death Cab for Cutie album not their worst record certainly better than their last one in an odd way it kind of reminded me of one of my favorite Ben Gibbard related projects Postal Service in that the music sounded very sanitary very pristine kind of futuristic though these smart lyrics and passion heartbreak and super catchy songs we're nowhere to be found yeah it's it's it's pretty underwhelming and and somewhat lifeless though again I I do appreciate what they were shooting for I guess unfortunately I think you can kind of put Alice in Chains up on the board with this one with many of the other 90s bands who have continued to drop music into this decade who have really kind of given in to a lot of the cheap modern rock studio trickery that makes a lot of recordings in the genre these days sound incredibly lifeless gutless and really lacking all of the raw excitement that made Alice in Chains interesting in the first place yeah this was a pretty generic the guitar tones were bland the production just really kind of sucked anything cool that could have come out of this record out of the room so there we go one of dancehall and reggae x' boldest and most memorable voices is back with a new album it is a pretty versatile record with a lot of solid features some tight and catchy production I do think his voice sounds as original and as one-of-a-kind as ever but it's a bit of a double-edged sword with sass Co because while his voice does really stand out as it is incredibly deep and raspy has a ton of passion and personality there are a limited amount of contexts in which I think his voice can be done justice and when he does try to stretch beyond his comfort zone on this record some of the results do come out kind of awkward but if you do want to hear a mix of modern reggae and dancehall with a one-of-a-kind voice give this thing a shot look I know I liked a few tracks from this album in my weekly track roundup so I was looking forward to it I was hoping it would be better than their last but unfortunately I just don't really see this album as an improvement for the lemon twigs this thing sounds like if the Rolling Stones are trying to make a really bad School Musical the performances are really awkward and amateurish and obviously there's an element of intent to that but it doesn't really make them any easier to swallow the drama and the singing throughout the record is really theatrical and campy but in maybe the corniest way possible and I'm not only enjoying a lot of the deep cuts on this thing either it just feels like kind of a mess Justin Vernon and Aaron Dessner team up once again as the Big Red Machine for a full-length album it's sometimes folky sometimes electronic sometimes experimental sometimes straightforward sometimes underwhelming sometimes exciting it's really all over the place I mean it's not a very consistent album I wouldn't give this thing a shot unless you really wanted to hear Erin and Justin take a series of artistic shots in the dark for one track after another some of the songs come out really good some others not so much but at least they're trying to forge some new ground or do some a little different it's just kind of like a weirdo sketchbook from two artists that hold quite a bit of weight in the indie scene it's okay we have another album here from dreamville zone boss AJ Cole disciple and i roughly feel the same way about this record as I did his last album I mean his flows are pretty laid-back very melodic very smooth the instrumentals don't really hit all that hard either they're pretty either soulful but they're very mild and light on the ears his sound is mature its likeable it seems like he's putting some kind of passion and thought into his lyrics but the end result is really just bland his lyrics don't hit me all that hard his performances just kind of fall into the background it's just very middle-of-the-road the man clearly has a solid baseline of talent but for the most part it just feels like he's making chill out and vibe music like everybody else but he is trying not to be as ignorant as possible so if you want to hear an album that's more of a thinking man's vibe then I guess we'll give this a shot there was a time when pig destroyer was one of the most terrifying and vicious bands in grind and now they just sound as chunky and overly heavy and as meat-headed as just like a generic metalcore band which is basically how a lot of these songs play you know there's some spots where it's just super sped up super fast you have some blast beats you know some grind Corbett's actual grind core but a lot of the time it just feels like again really meaty metalcore riffs throughout the vocals even take kind of a metalcore tone a lot of the time it just feels like pig destroido and metalcore and with some really bland uninteresting results you know it's it's a listenable it's hard-hitting I guess but it certainly doesn't stand out not in 20 18 s musical landscape overall this thing is a pretty likable art rock record Anna has some super solid vocals and some very despondent atmospheres maybe her most eerie and gothic album so far but some of the songwriting is kind of bland lyrics occasionally leave a little to be desired but there are some solid songs on here you know there are some pretty theatrical vocals that I do sometimes think she's going a little over the top with it to the point where it does get slightly obnoxious but you know I think there are more great things about this record then there are bad things you know so if art rock and very dramatic front women are your thing very strong singer songwriters are the powerful and womanly tone to their voice then give this a shot the new wild nothing is okay I guess the singing and songwriting is a bit bolder than it was on the last album certainly not as washed out on this record over here but for the most part the aesthetics and the melodies on this record just feel completely indebted to just jangle pop and synth pop and new wave of the 1980s and early 90s to the point where it's incredibly distracting and it's hard to see this album as just not living in the shadow of that era and feeling like a watered down take on it because I don't feel like Tatum's approach to the whole sound on this thing is all that refreshing whereas you could argue on his previous efforts there was a very modern and dreamy contemporary yet trendy take on those sounds that he was delivering and and pretty well now that just doesn't really seem to be as much the case and it's just okay it's so sad and yet so bland and so cleanly produced like I guess I just don't see the the appeal of music that's trying to be this intimate and moody and yet it sounds so idyllic to the point where it doesn't really feel like anything's wrong it sounds like it's trying to communicate genuine feelings of heartbreak and yet the vocals are so boring and lifeless meanwhile the production is so pillowy and in such soft focus I feel like I'm just being subjected to a bad afternoon soap opera outside of the more stripped back and piano-driven moments on this thing I just didn't really feel for this record and the songs on it at all yeah just not for me I guess next the new scars on broadway some of the hardcore system of the downed fans have been asking me what I think about this and I'm sort of unhappy you know I wish we could get another goddamn system of a down album but instead we are being subjected to tracks that just sound like demos at this point you know the the it's it's not even the surge isn't involved with this but it just sounds like rough recorded System of a Down tracks that would later be built up into something else and and that's so disappointing the Winnipeg noise rockers and sludge metal errs Ken mode are back with a new full-length LP 35 minutes long pretty tight straighten to the point not as post hardcore heavy and punk intensive as their last full-length album I feel like they're going back to the blistering faster heavier sounds of their material prior to that which I thought was okay but for the most part flew by is such a speed where very little of it actually landed and left an impression on me and despite how aggressive this album is I'm feeling roughly the same way about this new album over here it is very hard-hitting it is very in-your-face but I feel like very little of it actually leaves an impression on me as it just feels like a flurry and that's not to say that it's just really about the speed and the pace at which everything moves I mean I don't really think a lot of the riff writing is all that either I don't really get whipped up in a lot of the grooves of the album and I don't know a lot of what's presented here doesn't really feel all that different from what the band has done in the past maybe a shade or two less extreme which I think works against this record honestly I mean look if you're huge in a noise rock or you're huge into sludge metal give it a shot because there are a lot of good things going for it it seems like there are a lot of people enjoying this record but I don't know I I don't think it's one of the Bands best been getting a lot of requests for this new choker album unfortunately I'm not really all that into it though I do hear some of the great things in this record that a lot of you guys are I like the fact that it's experimental there's a lot of cool sound play on the album too on the production end of things it's very very creative and kind of cutting edge but when it comes to vocals and songwriting and just musical style I feel like choker has a lot to do to sort of evolve past this overt Frank Ocean influence to the point where if you told me some of these tracks for like Frank Ocean demos I'm I maybe might believe you or something so I feel like choker has a lot of good things going on a lot of potential but it cannot just be slightly more experimental Frank Ocean worship it can next uniform I was kind of looking forward to this LP because the teaser track sounded super EXTREME and certainly the sound of this album is that it is so blisteringly loud that I was afraid my speakers were we're breaking or busting as I was listening to it because it's it is that ugly coming out of really anything that I listened to it on like it is ear searingly loud however I feel like compositionally and vocally there's not a whole lot to what the band are doing it just kind of sounds like generic aggressive hardcore ish punk music but produced in such a way where it is just ear drum destruction for one track after another I appreciate the extremity with which the the band has approached the whole sound front of this album with but as far as like the riffs and the vocals and the songwriting there's there's not a whole lot I want to return to you though again I am impressed at how destructive the the sound of this album is yeah this new Paul McCartney albums a a little bit of a mess I mean there's some decent piano rock on here and power pop occasionally some ballads that are okay but it's really inconsistent and and the song thought you might be the worst song of the year it may just be I mean there's some spots on this album when it does sound like wow Paul Paul really still has it you know he's still kind of got it but fuck you is like the awful song to end all awful song it's like he's trying his best to sound like a terrible millennial songwriter God is it terrible one of the most brutal progressive rock bands and Zul outfits are back with a full-length LP it's been a while since I've heard a new album from these guys and they sound really tightly composed they sound like they're playing their goddamn hearts out but I have not been able to get past the production on this LP I feel like the drums are mixed in such a wonky fashion the vocals and the horns are so high to the point where it feels like the zany vocal harmonies and which if you're familiar with Zula music you will know exactly what I'm talking about are just like right up in my ear whereas I I just wish they were a bit lower and mixed in more of a group so you're kind of hearing like a separate chorus it just feels like the instrumentation isn't all that balanced and I mean if you're familiar with Co n G's music at all you you really want to hear the drums in a crisp and a bright and an upfront fashion because yoshida Tatsuya is an amazing drummer I love his work on previous records from the band on many ruins albums to maybe I'm just being a bit finicky here and a little too overly judgmental on the sound of the album because it's not like I dislike the compositions on on the record it's not like I dislike what I can make out some of the playing on this thing but it just seems like like there's not a whole lot of balance between what's going on with the bass the percussion and the treble on here the keyboards just seem very very digital and that kind of distracts me a bit too yeah there's there's not a lot of balance I guess in the mix on this thing and it's a bit obnoxious and for me personally it's unfortunate because it did kind of ruin my enjoyment though for a lot of fans I guess it's it's not a big deal because I've been seeing some people say some really great things about this album and this is most likely one of the few albums in this style you're going to hear this year if this is in fact your kind of thing so I don't know I guess give it a shot if you're a huge prog guy and that is it for this edition of Y you know review everyone thank you for watching hopefully you guys didn't

idIoNJQGrAg,Oh Brad okay okay all right okay hi everyone oh the knee right tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new thou album Magus this is the latest full-length album from Baton Rouge sludge and doom metal band thou I first covered the band's music back in 2010 when they released their breakout album summit a record that showed that to be one of the most exciting up-and-comers that sludge and doom had to offer and even though summit didn't make my favourite albums of the year list it did offer for massive tracks with abrasive vocals and guitars a massive and apocalyptic sound moving at a glacial pace and outside of getting some heavier production and a larger presentation those sound has not changed all that much since then though their last full length album heben pushed their sound to the limits of intrigue with a 75 minute runtime an album that long is not necessarily a bad thing in theory but I didn't really feel like those sound and style was really so versatile that it was done any justice by being strung out to that length plus their latest full-length LP over here is pretty much the same amount of time stretched over nearly the same amount of tracks and unfortunately the band hasn't really made their sound that much more interesting with an hour and 15 minutes of time to play with I mean there are some admirable things the band are doing this time around easily magaz features the best production on any vow album so far they're very noisy and brittle take on sludge most definitely plays into a long line of artists from the Louisiana area who have done that very same thing like I hate God the abrasive guitars and vocals on this thing combined with the grand atmosphere the band presents almost strikes a slight black metal tone at points on this record I'm not saying it's an overt influence or an intentional reference but merely an interesting similarity the band are also doing a slightly better job of coloring these very slow heavy riffs all over the album with some incredibly triumphant and tragic guitar melodies some of the best of which turn up on the changeling Prince occasionally the performances on this thing can be pretty crushing - like the blaring and aggressively played guitar chords sync up really well with the bone crushing drums on the kingdom of meaning but despite all these good things that Magus has to offer I'm still at a point where I feel like thou are stretching a somewhat one-dimensional sound very thin with these massive runtimes I mean the obvious need for a breather is very much addressed by the band with these kind of shorter interlude type tracks that pop in every once in a while that features some softer Spacey er tones a lot of atmosphere just to bring some kind of counterpoint to the endless and vast sludge escapes the band brings on most of the tracks here and even though it is a nice touch it doesn't change that I just feel this need for a bit more variation from tracks like inward and sovereign self both of which could have gotten a bulk of their ideas out in a much shorter runtime occasionally the band will work in a soaring or shimmering guitar lead into their usual repertoire or even on kingdom of meaning I mentioned earlier there's a clean vocal that pops in miraculously in the second leg which was a really nice touch and did add to the likeability of the track quite a bit it's also worth noting the band does bring in some shots of feedback and roaring walls of guitar distortion to break up some of the monotony on the closing track supremacy the last leg of which is a huge dissonant drone that certainly ends the album off with a bang but still on Magus the sound is not really all that dynamic nor are there compositions so engaging that they're really worth eating up every second of which is not necessarily a bad thing for a band in the sludge or doom metal category because there are plenty of groups in that genre that you can really just stew in their sound I can sit and soak in a dope smoker I can sit and soak in some electric wizard or a satan-worshipping doom but I guess I just don't find those sounds so aesthetically appealing that I can just sit with it without an attention-grabbing progression or a super aggressive performance because for the most part they sound is really too abrasive and harsh to feel cerebral or numbing and yet the album wasn't consistently explosive and hard-hitting enough to feel visceral throughout for me either this thing just sits in a weird middle ground that doesn't really scratch either itch for me significantly enough despite my complaints on this thing I do think this is a likable album and it is certainly fine while it's on but there's not a whole lot about this thing that makes me want to come back to it outside of a couple tracks the size of this record is pretty impressive the production throughout is pretty nice the performances are solid too I'm feeling a light two DS and six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which a tire view next hit the like if you liked please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another review for you to check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana music forever

UoAAk3tRb-g,Oh hi everyone Tran that he sent a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Oakland colo album cantos this is the debut full-length album from Oakland colo a new york-based group with afro-cuban and your Reuben roots and even though the group itself may be relatively new it does feature veteran musicians who have been playing Latin music for quite a while and are also adherence to the Santeria religion I don't usually dive that deeply into the religious background of the musicians that I cover on this channel however this was kind of a special case as these songs on this album are very much an exercise in the Santeria and faith not just because of the lyrics on the album and the call and response chants used throughout this record too but also because of the prominence of bata drums on this record as well a hand drum which has a long history of use in religious practices and goes beyond just a musical tool as in an interview bandleader Abraham Rodriguez describes his entrance into the Santeria religion with a ceremony where it needed to be seen whether or not the spirit of the drum accepted him as his son so the vocal and drumming style central to the religious practices that I've been talking about are very much central to the music on this record pretty much throughout with some occasional moments where the band might pick up the pace pick up the groove and add in some more accessible Latin music passages still though even in it sketchiest moments the religious angle of this record cannot be ignored it is very prevalent even the title of this album cantos can be interpreted to mean chants in a religious context but the recordings on this album are arranged in such a way where they can be enjoyed pretty easily outside of the purview of religion as producer and musician Jacob PLAs who collaborated with the band on this record brings in tons of guitar bass strings brass wreaths to really color the band's vocals and drums and the instrumental additions to the chants and rhythms on this record are actually pretty tasteful and powerful and only helped the band's already entrancing sound become even more transcendental the drumming on this thing for the most part is fantastic you're talking about a group of people playing hand drums it is the most organic a groove can get it's so natural it flows so beautifully this album has groove and the vocals on this thing are equally impressive especially when they're being delivered by the groups to female singers Amma McKenna and jadelle McPherson the lead vocal that opens up the track obba is absolutely stunning maybe one of the most stunning moments on the entire record it's soul shocking it sounds like I'm listening to a ghost sing a beautiful song of loneliness from another dimension some of the background vocals feel a bit off but I think they're slightly sour demeanor only adds to the character of the track and the forlorn attitude of some of the vocal passages meanwhile Jacob's Arrangements on the track are ever shifting from strings to Reed's to guitar and bass it never really settles into one idea for too long he's always throwing things and swapping stuff out given whatever the emotional tone of the vocals and the drums are as the instruments he places on the very moody intro contrasts pretty boldly from the groovier moments on the back end of the track which is one of many amazing instrumental transitions throughout the album the song ocean for example goes from beautifully tragic to full-on Latin dance section with sparkly guitars and funky horns in its final moments and the track canto a so Yin sounds strangely sassy there's something kind of joyous and smiley and playful about the call and response vocals on this specific track not to mention the phat swinging horn lines that play throughout a good deal of the cut sound like something out of an old R&B song and no I don't mean like an old-school 80s or 90s contemporary R&B song I mean like from the 50s like rhythm and blues but suddenly the track is thrown into these darker and chillier vocal lines that get a touch of wintry atmosphere from the backing instrumentation the mood transitions on this record are so fantastic it's like Jacob in the group really pull the rug out from under you but in a pretty thrilling way much of the time especially with the creative layers of vocals and horns that the track eventually evolves into I wish more songs on this album unfolded this intricately or subtly like in the case of the gentle and in skating Obatala and the track canto poor Intune is one of the most chillingly beautiful spots on the entire record - the song sounds like a grand pilgrimage across the astral plane with the vocals and the drums kind of setting the pace the ethereal and swelling tones that jacob places into the background add to the grandness of the musical presentation and the track feels larger and larger as it progresses forward despite the very humble bassline of drums and vocals now there are some downsides to the songs on this album unfortunately I do think that sometimes the arrangements the vocals and the drums almost feel like they are coming from different places kind of like the extra bits of strings or synths or ethereal effects just feel a little tacked on just kind of coloring on top of what the vocals and drums are doing as opposed to being integrated with them for example these soaring string sections on Abraham's voice on the track valencia port Chango feel less like a religious experience and more like musical theater and given that what we're being presented with here are religious chants and not pop tunes some of the structures aren't all that traditional or predictable so some of the transitions and finishes of these tracks come off a bit awkward or super abrupt for example the opening track yemaja has one of the most dramatic intros on the entire album sets the tone of the record beautifully the drum and vocal progressions on this track are fire eventually the track reaches a point where it is met with these shimmery either string or synth sounds that are really beautiful otherworldly the pace gets faster and faster some very dramatic woodwinds are introduced to enhance the chord changes but then all of a sudden the track just stops it ends super suddenly mid progression it's just over like that it's like the track just literally evaporates or the rapture took it away as it was just in the midst of building up to what I do not know meanwhile the track canto poro Batala seems like a pretty straightforward chant with some little woodwind and horn sections to kind of enhance the spots in between the vocals I won't deny that the singing is nice and the instrumental melodies are pretty mystical but the song doesn't really build up toward anything it's a lot of tension but not a whole lot of Ascension the closing track in my opinion trails off very much at its finish and a lot of the progressions up until that point feel a little random and don't really build up a whole lot of momentum even though it does sound pretty despite the fact that some of the opening vocals are a little rough it's kind of like hitting the reset button numerous times on the track as it transitions from one idea to the next it's like everything that it's been building up to that point just crumbles and it starts anew and I do not mean that in a way that improves or enhances the song all that much still though I enjoyed this record quite a bit it's nine tracks it's 34 minutes it's pretty tight it's sweet on the ears it's beautiful as I said there is a transcendental quality to it a haunting quality to the religious chants the drumming and the gorgeous arrangements I see this album as a beautiful little spiritual oasis that I just did not see coming and I'm really happy entered into my life I wish some of the tracks on this thing we're a bit longer or made grander musical statements but as short as some of these songs and this album are this thing is packed with powerful performances flavorful instrumentation lots of intense emotions some thrilling twists and progressions - I'm feeling a strong six - a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantan oh okay Nicole Oh forever 
PBAuMgx3uwk,again the good albums keep coming hi everyone good the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Armand Hammer paraffin this is the latest full-length album from new york hip hop duo a lucid and billy woods AKA armand hammer i first covered the duo back in 2015 when they dropped their debut album race music i enjoyed the project abstract heavy production and very grim cryptic lyricism from two of the East Coast's most unique rappers right now their follow-up album a few years later Rome I found to be a little underwhelming an album that was much rar than their debut with a lot of the production taking out a loaf I tone with some very repetitive loops it felt like there was less lyrical and vocal impact on the album overall in comparison with the last record to me it was almost as if Billy and a lucid were on autopilot just a little bit for this one as each of them dropped sizable solo project within the same span of time so I'm not sure if that stretched things thin a little bit as someone who's consistently been a fan of Armand Hammer and Billy woods pretty much anything that that dude touches the record brought a lot of the same qualities and characteristics that I enjoyed about Armin Hammers previous work but I just failed to see the album as the duo making a significant improvement on their sound but now that I'm hearing this new album it feels almost as if Rome was laying the groundwork for the grimy dirty grim and psychedelic avenues that Armand Hammer take their songs down here tracks like the Bumi and abyssal rehearsed with Ornette are bold standouts because there's all this intense feedback woven into the beat it's incredibly eerie then there's these ethereal jazz loops on the song Dettol the jazz sampling on this cut adds a sour dramatic tone to the weird mix of sentimental dark and tragic bars on the cut then there's the nightmarish Fuhrman tapes whose instrumental is so frightening I really can't even start to describe it accurately not to mention there are some genius beat switches on this album too like the roaring rock guitars that bustin suddenly at the end of if he holla meanwhile the first leg of the track is painted with these really faint what sounds like new metal samples or something or a metalcore breakdown I'm not sure it's really buried into the beat but adds a perfect amount of very subtle texture then there's the jazzy flute hits and woozy electric pianos that suddenly pop in on alternate side parking which is absolutely ear gasma the moment that transition happens it's like time to slows down overall the production on this thing is fantastic it sounds very much in tribute to some of the best underground hip hop artists and acts of the late 90s and the 2000s you know we're talking Def Jux and Stones Throw MF DOOM mad lib that sort of thing LP as well but I would say that Armand Hammer in there producers take it a step further because these beats they're textured they're heavy they're lazy they're groovy but sometimes they're also glitching out or they are soaked and treated in these psychedelic delays and distortions and filters which works really well for a lucid and Billy woods respective cerebral lyrical styles and there are a lot of amazing and esoteric samples littered throughout this thing too many of which are methodically treated and manipulated chopped up so placing their origins sometimes can be difficult if you have listened to a lucid or Billy woods or Armand Hammer before there are some familiar faces on the production end of this thing like Kenny Segal and Willy green a lucid also handles quite a few of the beats on this thing too I will say though a lucid and Billy sometimes are throwing in everything but the kitchen sink on these beats and it does drown out some of the vocals on a couple of tracks here take away from that lyrical impact but still they do bring a strong sonic vibe because lyrically and sonically a lot of these songs sound like they're coming straight out of a hip-hop Twilight Zone where Billy woods in a lucid are processing some serious mental demons some PTSD paranoia as well a lucid and woods also have quite a bit of lyrical chemistry on this album certainly much more than they presented on Rome as it felt like they were kind of separate on that record here though they're kind of reinforcing one another topically on tracks like no days off which is very much a track about economic struggles or even trading bars and little mini verses back and forth with each other on a track here and there but for the most part each artists verses on this record don't necessarily add up into a super clear narrow a lot of what they are spinning is a lot of non sequitur stuff tangent stuff but consistently it's pretty slick cleverly worded and despondent and on the macro level I think the album does paint a lyrical portrait of what happens to people who live on the fringes of society who slipped through the cracks of a callous America I think a bar from Billy woods at the end of the track if he holla kind of encapsulate s' the lyrical tone of both him and elusive verses throughout a great deal of the album and that is off message even when I'm on topic collectively a lucid and woods weave together these lyrical flashes of systemic marginalization criminality and New York's dark underbelly which is not new lyrical territory for these two given but I do think both of them are approaching these topics more boldly than they were half a decade ago when they forged this duo and certainly existing under the Trump administration has given them more material to work with in his versus Billy continues to be one of the most hilarious witty but also grim rappers that I know saying things like every live show forget the lyric forty doing tae-bo who'd have guessed this be how I finished to everyone who got caught I'm there in spirit he continues delivering these lyrics in this kind of casual but shouted delivery and flow it's like he's the town crier if the town were Twin Peaks and often in his verses he'll go off on these weird lyrical diatribes that don't necessarily add up into a clear story but they connect line to line in interesting ways the perpetrator was a different shade of black beat the case said let him eat cake in his raps service weapon in my face all I could see was his lips chapped wouldn't recognize him if I saw him today chokehold slowly closed the Airways sunk in place I can't stay you built it on Indian graves the lead character exclaims it's funny because Billy's rap style sort of forces you to change perspectives again and again and again and like recontextualized what exactly he's trying to say with each single bar every single time because he's coming through with an off reference or he's rapping from another point of view it's it's really an insane way of painting a picture also in his verses he continues to come off like a man who just knows too much like if he were just throwing names out there in his rhymes actually put more context into what he was saying he literally be snitching on himself or other people like on the song alternate side parking where he brings up this line about getting into a car and people don't tell you the car is stolen until you're already in it enrolling which for anybody who's been in the situation where someone else is kind of putting your livelihood in danger that should put a pit in your stomach a lot of the time it feels like Billy is trying to tell cautionary tales in a world that he constantly paints as being evil or at least the world that he is surrounded by and as I said before that lyrical wit that he has it's on full display on this album as a lot of his one-liners on this record are hilarious but like with his previous material there's usually a very dark and grim reveal there to whatever that dark joke he is throwing out there as he's exposing a lot of harsh realities that for most people are kind of out of sight out of mind a lot of things he says in my opinion have the effect of I don't know lifting a blanket or something only to find there's an intrusion of cockroaches underneath it's scattering in every direction and one of my favorite lyrics from him on this album actually comes toward the end of the record as Billy says I found some people would rather die than cut you a slice of the pie now a lucid is not without his own sense of humor his universally true statements on this album there's one spot on the track black garlic that stood out to me as he rants again and again legalese is designed to overwhelm you legalese is designed to overwhelm you as statistically speaking it does seem like a legal system in a lot of ways is designed to disenfranchise the poor the uneducated now elusive style is different but complimentary to Billy's in that it's pretty rapid-fire a little overwhelming he's got some really dynamic flows a raspy voice and a lot of word choices that just kind of feel like dictionary deep cuts things that I think people who are like let's say Aesop Rock fans will really enjoy but on this album a lucid lay is a lot of very heavy political themes in his verses as throughout this record he is not shy at all when it comes to approaching racism inequality trump corrupt police and he can get pretty existential too on some of the cuts here like one bar that stood out to me on the track is when he was rapping about speaking to an unframed sky combined with just how atmospheric an open the instrumental on that track is I think that line speaks a lot to the gigantic vastness that surrounds our insignificant existence on planet Earth I also like the way he poetically put the lows of low wages on the track no days off let me get your supervisor on the phone late stage capital shooting down the living wage caveman figure rational castles with eyes in the sky claiming both the proud and the wise normalize us with the fuckshit the corporation they must trust I'll get that for you no rush and as I said before a lucid can be witty and humorous as well like on the track black garlic I absolutely loved the tangent he goes off on with that track as he's kind of spinning about internet hip hop culture bringing up DJ Vlad doing what like white splaining to disinterested black women then he talks about little Wayne doing an acoustic cover of the song sign of the times it just seems like an absurd parody it's also fitting on this album at one point that he drops a reference to halfway crooks because as I was listening through to this record I did get almost like a mob deep vibe at points like like woods and elusive are this totally underground abstract like version of mob deep in a way and oddly enough there's also something about this record that kind of makes me want to compare it to the recent Travis Scott record Astroworld but if the production psychedelic tendencies were meant more to put you in a state of depression then put you in a state of euphoria not to mention also the Armand Hammer actually has something of substance to say but I think both albums are comparably experimental intoxicating and also feature a lot of interesting musical transitions within songs or from track to track knowing their outsider status and their feelings about their artistic process I'm not exactly sure if a lucid and woods would appreciate that comparison but I don't know it's just a vibe that I caught overall I think this is a great record I loved it I really enjoyed it I think it's one of the best abstract hip-hop records I've heard in a while at its best this thing is amazingly produced texturally deep super stimulating and lyrically layered like an onion there's tons of replay value in this record and it just reveals more and more and more with each listen at its worst though this album can be really indirect to the point where it can feel a little unengaging it can also be really impenetrable so if you're a newcomer to abstract hip-hop or Arm & Hammer in general don't necessarily come into this album expecting to just get it right off the bat the album is also super self indulgent which may turn some people off and there are a handful of short like two-minute cuts on here which I think could have used a bit more structure just to leave a stronger impact but really there was nothing on this album I thought was so bad it was worth skipping even the most underwhelming or lackluster moments on this thing features some great lyrics or some super creative production the narrative and the flow of the entire album isn't really all that strong as it does feel pretty random at points the finishing track is kind of despondent and does give a real sense of finality though but despite lacking in those departments Billy and illusive do a good job of creating a nice momentum track to track to track as there are some quick and interesting transitions from one song to another making the listening experience with this album kind of seamless feeling a decent - strong 8 on this one transition have you given this album a listen

4i2PpkVGQNQ,ah it's too hot out for this flannel garbage I didn't think this final thing all the way through because I have nothing appropriate to wear during the summer months when I have a super positive or super negative review sounds like you didn't think this whole flannel thing all the way through buddy oh did I hear something no I I don't think I heard anything at ten out of ten review it again a ten out of ten hi everyone to three hot tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the brand new idols album joy as an act of resistance this is the latest full-length LP from UK post-punk upstarts idols who dropped an impeccable debut album last year Brutalism a record that truly lived up to its name as the band took the base sounds of very groovy and lyrically dense post-punk music then turned it up with the highest volumes the nastiest distortions veins popping out of it in every direction I love the savage collision of influences on this album from crass to the fall to Sex Pistols I love the gravely and guttural lead vocals from frontman Joe Talbot as well as the sticky hooks the very cheeky thoughtful lyrics which a lot of the time were pretty socially charged I took slight issue on this album with the band's somewhat one-dimensional style and cloaking some of their politics on the record in some esoteric symbolism but mostly this thing was a fantastic Punk record with a lot of great things going for it fast forward to now and idols are following this album up faster than I thought they would and I wasn't really sure what to think going into the album because I wasn't super crazy about a lot of the teaser tracks on first listen and I couldn't really glean anything from them as far as an overall direction for this record however for the band idols I think joy is an improvement on all imaginable fronts the animalistic and throttling punk rock that was on the group's last record is still present so that carries over the politics the band delivers on this record are clearer more thoughtful more up front they are poetically put and really kind of inescapable on this record as it seems like there's some sort of social ill the band is taking on with each song whether they are attacking macho overly stoic masculinity on the track Samaritans or media born insecurity on the track television the slower and heavier and more dramatic cuts from the band's last record go over so much better on joy as the band delivers more interesting lyrics punchy er production a more dynamic progression like on the opening track from this thing Colossus which features these super heavy drums wailing guitars in the background creating a lot of atmosphere pummeling bass all of this comes to a really frantic and noisy crescendo toward the back end of the track it almost reads like something off of swans to be kind in a way aesthetically but the intense run the band plays through on this track is packed into a five-minute runtime and the lyrics make for a powerful statement on regret and self-loathing and living in the shadow of traditionalism and your parents the album transitions next into the track never fight a man with a perm with a plane faced reference to Nancy Sinatra's these boots are made for walkin the track is pretty much a straightforward takedown of brainless muscle heads calling guys who spend every day in the gym hooked up on gear walking thyroids and catalogs I also love the song was a very slow heavy massive and muscular riffy chorus the critiques on masculine stereotypes get even stronger on the track I mentioned previously Samaritans wear talbot can be heard shouting these phrases usually meant to make men kind of bottle up their feelings or fall in line man up sit down chin up don't cry grow some balls I also like the statement on the track of wearing a mask of masculinity and ends up wearing you and the sound of the track the performance is pretty brutal with some soaring very very sour and abrasive guitars kind of wailing away against a very steady rhythm section the song I'm scum is a somewhat tongue-in-cheek self-critique Weir Talbot portrays himself as being kind of thoughtful and righteous someone who seems pretty fair and pretty just but simultaneously comes off maybe a pretentious a little contentious to lower-class however I don't really mind some of those characteristics though it's it's maybe why fuck with the vibe of the song it just seems like he's framing himself to be someone who is unapologetically not living up to these standards of perfection and traditionalism at one point on the song referring to himself as a snowflake and saying that this snowflakes in avalanche overall the song just kind of seems like a lot of very funny right-wing prodding the bass and drum grooves on the track oddly enough are very peppy and are painted with some very colourful and noisy guitars a lot of the time it seems like Joe's voice and the guitars are in a constant competition to see which can make the track sound filthier these song Dan Enid Elko though I don't find to be as grimy has a lot of other cuts on this record in fact it's pretty catchy and light-hearted by comparison with a lot of the other songs here it's one of my favorite songs on the album and it's pretty much a rager about change and immigration in England it's about unity it's about acceptance of others as he goes through a series of lyrics referring to people who he knows personally or people in his family life who are aliens or came from a different country or a different race the song is actually named after someone who he refers to as his best friend in reference to him and some of the other foreigners who he's talking about on the track saying some of my favorite lyrics on the entire record he's made of bones he's made of blood he's made of flesh he's made of love he's made of you he's made of me unit a also loved the following fear leads to panic panic leads to pain pain leads to anger anger leads to hey I also love how the band incorporates elements of punk into this track with the giant group chanting yeah yeah yeah background vocals boy does have some pretty blue-collar roots but it's not traditionally the most progressive section of the punk sub-genre so it's interesting the band are repurposing it for a different kind of message the song great is also a blistering critique of the rise of nationalism in England right now poking fun at brexit ears and older generations for being unable to accept change saying blade he wants his country back 50 inch screen in his cul-de-sac Goomba charm of the Union Jack he cries at the price of a bacon bap Islam didn't eat your hamster change isn't a crime so won't you take my hand sir and sing with me in time it's another socially charged barnburner with a sing-along chorus which is actually one of a couple moments on the album that involves spelling there's a lot more spelling on this new album why so much spelling the track love song is one of the space ear mid-paced cuts on the record and is Talbot and company kind of lampooning the idea of modern love modern romance not a topic that was all that thrilling on the band's last record especially the tracks slow savage which was a little tedious but this love song here is so much more satirical so much funnier and so much more exciting instrumentally as a lot of what's said on the track seems to come down to this manic devotion displayed through almost completely empty gestures look at this card I bought it says I love you also the lalalala background vocals they kind of guide us out of the chorus seem to put out another reference to this idea of insanity playing a role in this love that Talbott is singing about the song joong is the most dramatic spacey and atmosphere cut on the entire record interesting that they would place it right in the center of the tracklist it's another moment on the album where the slow despondent guitars come together into a barrage that reads a lot like a new swans album some very simple and hypnotic drums thumping gently throughout the cuts some droney Keys building guitars and absolutely tortured vocals from Talbot as it's pretty clear he is singing about the loss of a newborn child a stillborn finishing the track off singing baby shoes for sale never worn never worn the track does come to a pretty powerful crescendo but kind of fizzles out afterwards but it's it's still an emotionally potent cut on the album even if it's not structurally the best because believe me when I say it is dark it is Preem li dark the song cry to me cease the band changing things up in an interesting way with them doing like a 12 bar blues type structure and talbot is like vocally wailing his way through it the guitars and the bass are absolutely insane the track to me reads is like the peak of dark humor on the record meanwhile the song Rottweiler stands out as one of the most fiery closers I've heard on a new record all year the lyrics come off as some of the most absurd and blunt on the entire record which is a little refreshing because a bulk of the album is pretty political that absurdity that was laced throughout a lot of songs on Brutalism isn't quite as prevalent on this new album though it is nice to get a taste of it here and there on cuts like this and Graham Rock instrumentally speaking the track is fast its aggressive but it's pretty straightforward however as the band progresses toward a very noisy and cacophonous finish the screws on this things start to loosen and the performances the vocals the the tightness of the instrumentation starts to melt away a little bit in the band starts sounding truly demented again as I said very powerful finish to the album and overall I loved this record supremely an improvement over the band's last effort way more diversity on here much more in terms of interesting lyrics electrifying performances pretty much everything I loved about the last album but vastly improved if I think the band made a huge change or shifted away from something on this new album there aren't quite as many songs on this thing that dabble in absurdist or self-deprecating humor but I think they're very smart thoughtful and well put politics on this record combined with the more dynamic performances and the wider diversity of stylistic influences are a good trade-off while Idol still continued not to be the most original band under the Sun they still kind of where their influences on their sleeve pretty boldly they're not reinventing the wheel or anything but they do approach this album with great production top-notch performances great tunes great songs and a pretty distinct personality too I'm feeling a light too decent 9:00 on this thing Tran have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what you hire you next hit the like if you like

no hear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new George Clinton album slide this is the new full-length LP from new york-based singer songwriter producer George Clinton who has been dropping music for a while now under a number of different names and bands at one point Mirror kisses and kids garden when he was more of a fixture in the Virginia music scene but George also releases music currently I believe under the name s pre as well which if you take a look at the front covers of Records like Virtua zip and 200% electronica it should be no surprise that on these releases George dabbles in a bit of vaporwave in a bit of chill wave those genres and more inform the music under his own name as well on this new album on which they kind of reach a point of culmination and refinement while some vaporwave and new-age aesthetics do inform the the sound of slide this album is also a healthy exercise in synth-pop bedroom pop alternative dance and shoegaze - there's a touch of hypnagogic pop on this record as well even though the cultural touchstones that George references on this album are different than that of the artists that helped establish this style of music James Ferraro Ariel pink John Maus night Jule Gorge doesn't really dabble that deeply in the 70s and 80s pastiche that those artists sometimes do instead Clanton has a strong affinity for the 90s the pop rock and dance music of that time and it really pours through on this new album in the mid paced rhythms the blissful atmospheres the slow burning angst that comes off of some of the vocals from this record sure while a lot of slides production does pull from very contemporary underground internet-based music and there's maybe a bit of panda bear mixed in there too I'm hearing an almost equal amount of influence coming from 90s touchstones like Siamese Dream and souvlaki and Screamadelica there are some trip-hop rhythms that seem to work their way into these tracks too and George successfully evokes this era of music all the sounds and vibes that come with it without necessarily embracing the production style and the instrumental palette either as a great deal of this record sounds completely synthetic doesn't sound like there's a whole lot of guitar on this thing rather slide sounds like a deeply synthetic album and beautifully so the sound craft on this record is actually pretty excellent it is beautiful it's dense it's lush it's psychedelic it's overwhelming it's orgasmic especially on cuts like make it forever the bulk of this track is littered with these envelope incurred x' droning into oblivion against these very abstract and squiggly lead melodies there's an explosive burst of synth layers and rhythms on the chorus that kind of explodes with the passion of the new radicals but presented with the sonic density of My Bloody Valentine would you come back good wicked mega Bubba I also like the driving rock rhythms in the grimy bass on the song tie me down it's a really gratifying track with some slacker rock frontman vocals it's a little spirit points but the track becomes one of the most intoxicating on the entire record once these songs heaviest synth layers blossom with some echo drenched synth leads despite a kind of innocuous intro the song dum finishes as one of the most kaleidoscopic and noisy tracks on the entire record the song transitions quickly into the next cut blast-off which is kind of a droning new-age cut I cannot emphasize the segue into this hack enough as it feels just like an extension it feels like I'm listening to the same track but a more pillowy and blissful instrumental version it's basically an extended outro of sorts for the most part that's the first five tracks of the album or so super beautiful super compelling very tight infectious tunes with an addictive euphoria so far it is very good I do like it a lot even if a weak link in the chain has kind of presented itself at this point that being the singing and the lyrics now don't get me wrong there are some vocal highlights on the album but much of the time the vocals do have a somewhat boyish and underwhelming tone and they can get lost in the haze of synthesizers on this album because they're mixed a little low or they're not that distinct like on the opening of the track dum plus there are so many songs on this album about being in love or love on the rocks which is a tried and true song topic it's fine but I wouldn't say George necessarily brings an interesting lyrical spin to this topic the lyrics mostly feel like an emotional placeholder just to kind of fill space because for the style of music George's making there should be a vocal there not to mention that I think he wants to consciously enhance the sort of sentimental and nostalgic vibe of the music the title track gets central with a dance beat straight out of the 90s a murky synth bassline some saxophone leads as well it's got a lot of nice sonic touches a beat switch and last legs some wintery synth chords but again the vocals come off a bit weak on the track the pacing feels a little weird as the song shifts from one section to the next as the momentum doesn't really keep up the vocals left me feeling kind of underwhelmed on the song monster too but the track clearly has a stronger melody and sense of direction the following track you lost me there is likeable enough but it's pretty much a more epic reprise of the track make it forever so hopefully you really like that song because now it's louder it's bigger and it's two times longer with slightly more expressive vocals now the album loops back around to this song because slide is a concept album a narrative album of sorts even though a lot of the lovesick and heartbroken lyrics on this album feel a little surface level they do tell a story track to track with George being lonely and living loose then George wanting that long-lasting love with this person who he has in mind then he's being tied down and tied to that person the love and the relationship fractures with the song dumb and then there is kind of a separation point the song monster is all about regret and being with other people instead of being with each other while you lost me there even though it is a reprise it does bring the same tune back with some more themes of love and longing and kind of just brings all the feelings of the album together and wraps them in a neat bow I suppose while also wishing for that person to come back and wondering if this love is meant to be I guess there is an encore interlude on the album and then a following track and epilogue I suppose walks slowly which is a pretty feel-good moment on the record with a nice sense of finality even if when it comes to song structure it is one of the weaker tracks on the record and does fizzle out with its ending I do like the fun rhythms and the cheeky turntable scratches on the cut though overall I generally like this album a lot I do think it does have its shortcomings its flaws there are moments where I think it doesn't go quite far enough but I think there are a lot of good and promising things here the production the sound the rhythms on this album and some of the tunes are amazing this album has a lot of passion a lot of heart even if I do think the vocals and lyrics kind of fall short the love romance breakup concept narrative of the record was a cool and a fine idea but did George go into it with the detail and the scope that I think he could have not really for a concept album this thing is kind of short of breath and I enjoy quite a bit one of the shortest breakup albums of all time and that is Tony Molina's dissed and dismissed so yes at some points the vocals are kind of math the lyrics do feel a little surface level they border on vapid and with the wealth of sounds that Clanton presents during the first leg of this record I think there could have been more diversity on this LP overall more tracks because George does sink quite a bit of this albums runtime into a few longer cuts especially this reprise this song and the track that it's building off of take up about a quarter of the album's runtime which is a bit much especially considering that the actual closing track of this thing feels like an on statement it just feels like the effort the focus and the passion of the record was applied on to these songs and a somewhat lopsided way as there are quite a few tracks on here that feel almost unnecessary or just pale in comparison to others and you can't really afford to have many snoozers or underwhelming moments in a tracklist that is so short in a run time that doesn't really afford you a whole lot of breathing room enjoyed this quite a bit wasn't blown away not head over heels but still wanting more and looking forward to what George is doing next feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you

J34qpusEXK4,hi everyone Sun 'funny burnt an O here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Eminem album kamikaze this is the new surprise album from top selling rapper of all time Detroit's own Eminem an artist who honestly needs no introduction but it is worth going over what exactly has brought us to this point right here truth be told Eminem had a pretty rough 2017 and all because he dropped one of the worst albums of the year easily the worst album of his career revival a record that received industry-wide backlash from fans and critics alike I know that I myself was pretty upset with the horrible guests and production the excruciating choruses and the obnoxious staccato flows Eminem would deliver in every track oh and there's also Eminem's painfully cringy bars on tracks like bad husband and offended just to name a few I do give it to Eminem that he does come up with some clever double entendre z' he does have some pretty unique flows and he does rap fast I cannot take that away from him but I think Eminem doesn't fully appreciate that these things alone don't make a good album a hard truth I think he's kind of lost touch with since the release of some of his biggest and earliest albums like The Slim Shady and Marshall Mathers LP S on those albums Eminem was an underdog weirdo with a refreshing style as well as a brutally dark and a cartoony sense of humor and at times he would get really serious as well and go into some really traumatic territory like violence and abuse and bullying addiction and his own lack of self control his personal struggles with fatherhood Eminem at one time was an unrepentant asshole whose rough upbringing gave him license to take his anger out on the ugly world that took him to the top of the charts he was hip hop's antihero in his abrasive personality was something that you either loved him or hated him for and most importantly back in the day I think Eminem actually cared how his tracks worked as songs not just as platforms to complain on top of musically and topically mm used to really have it together but these days not so much which brings us to kamikaze it's an album that in a lot of respects is merely a reaction to the negative reactions that revival justifiably got now of course there are a handful of tracks on this album that do not work that angle there are some relationship cuts on this record where Eminem continues to lay out his struggles with romance and picking out mrs. right and functioning normally in a healthy relationship like on tracks such as normal and the sister songs good guy and nice guy these songs are maybe not as awful as some of the more lovesick moments off a revival the song normal sounds like em on his Drake shit with a super Spacey beat and chill melodic flow it's very laid back it's kind of serene but Eminem lyrically applies those usual themes of anger and violence and borderline psychosis that typically pepper a lot of his love songs love songs these singing is kind of weak but I do admire the ambition of the track the beats which in the last leg is pretty great in some of these stalking bars in the final moments of the song are pretty hilarious - and the song nice guy with Jesse Reyes has a multifaceted hook like a nice pre-chorus before it it's got a bass II banger beat this odd shouted suck my dick refrain right before Jesse pops in on top of these glamorous pianos this whole section of the track feels almost Kanye asked to me her performance feels as psychotic as some of Eminem's lyrics on the track do even though I don't really care for how short the song is cut off I do think the song works as a concept piece about two people who should have never agreed to be in this very volatile relationship but then we get a sudden transition into this romantic track good guy which takes a much more apologetic tone and I don't know it it just seems like a weak change off to a more sappy sound something that kind of reminds me of like that really awful ed Sheeran cut that landed on revival I get what mm is trying to do here with the emotional flip of these two tracks and how they kind of mirror each other in a lot of ways but I think I think the transition and the whole idea here could have been executed a lot better and there's also the track stepping-stone where Eminem essentially apologizes to his former group d12 I like the personal angle the heartfelt tone of the track the performance from Eminem on an emotional level is pretty good it seems sincere but it's not really a high point on the album as the hook is a little rough the beat seems a little under baked like a lot of cuts off a revival did as there is this sudden rush of snares that fly in that guide us into the verses of the track that get kind of blown out and they clip and they distort and they sound horrendous again this is not the kind of production that you expect to be on an album from a top selling artist a platinum selling artist and what the hell is this ugly completely unlistenable jagged melodic flow backed up with these synth strings the Eminem hits us up with in the last leg of the song to my partners I can't say how sorry I am this is not how I planned for heart story to end I love I love you men but I am a the guy that is the worst sounding flow I've heard this year that is that is such a horrendous flow just because you have the technical ability to do something does not mean you should do it or that it sounds good unfortunately this is a lesson I think Eminem has yet to learn but for the most part this apology song just feels like an extended excuse because it's not like Shady Records couldn't have backed d12 much in the same way that they did slaughterhouse and as Eminem explains on the hook the whole motivation behind this song seems driven less by Eminem's feelings about the pain he might have caused people and more by the awkwardness that he'll feel if he doesn't wipe the slate clean before his career hits rock bottom and he might see some of the people who he heard face-to-face which is kind of an awful reason to apologize for anything I mean throughout the song you say that you didn't mean to use d12 as a stepping stone but all signs point to yes and honestly I don't really feel like this track is as deep or as meaningful or as helpful as legitimate putting an olive branch out there or finding some way to aid in the group's career at this point but maybe mmm just really doesn't have it in him to do anything other than just shrug in song and say hey guys I'm having a hard time charting myself at this point okay there's also the song venom the closer on this thing and of course this song is going to be on the upcoming movies soundtrack that's that's just perfect I can't really comment on this song outside of saying it has one of the ugliest choruses I've ever heard in my entire career Benna mmmm-mmm get him ain't gonna know what am mmmmmm how is this real-life how is this a real thing that a mainstream artist does on their song the rest of the album though is pretty much eminem getting confrontational with his critics or this new wave of trap rappers that in his opinion aren't really up to snuff lyrically they're not up to his technical ability man though Eminem on this album does employ some trendier beats and producers and flows too though much of the time when he does this it feels like he's trying to parody a more contemporary sound or just kind of show the audience hey I can do this too aren't I cool too and in some ways I do think it makes the material and Eminem on this album a bit more palatable but his consistently bitter and vengeful tone throughout a lot of the songs on this album kind of cancels that out and attitude that is very much set by the opening track on this thing the ringer keep in mind this track and the entire album kicks off with Eminem muttering into the microphone I feel like I want to punch the world in the fucking face right now you're so dramatic yeah this track is not as much a song as it is just Eminem ranting with a flow responding to his critics with some pretty half-assed lazy and boring arguments like I'm an artist you guys aren't artists you'll never be artists you guys just want sliders revival is a porterhouse it's too deep for you to get if you don't get my music you're retarded I bet you guys would have liked my last album if it was auto-tuned there's even a bar on the track where he says that media journalists can get a mouth full of flesh and yes I mean eating a penis yeah dude it's an Eminem album we know you mean eating a penis there's another bar on this track where he tries to beat his detractors to the inevitable critique of this album by saying oh why is he taking out the fact that his album sucks on us usually when you try to deal Ajith amaizing of your haters by throwing their opinions out there before they do you might try to exaggerate a flaw in their reasoning to point out how stupid that is really do or say anything to defuse that argument but yeah Eminem doesn't do that he just simply states that people are going to point out that he's essentially throwing a lyrical temper tantrum on this song because people didn't like his last record which is true you are throwing a temper tantrum on this track because you don't like the fact that people pointed out that your last album sucked that's all true it's all still true you you didn't make that any less legitimate an argument granted the track does have some impressive flows and rhymes but once again I feel like what good things Eminem brings forward are canceled out by the sad bitterness of the song it's really annoying especially considering there was a time in Eminem's career when he either took criticism in stride or he responded to it in a smart way that seemed like it was kind of rolling off his back the following track the greatest is way more enjoyable relatively speaking and essentially wanting to show that he has more aggression and flow and lyrics than his contemporaries so he just kind of puts it out there he does this thing over a pretty catchy beat somewhat obnoxious hook on this thing but I'll take it it's definitely more likeable than a lot of what else's on this thing he continues to throw shots at other rappers and his detractors but at least on this track he seems a lot less butthurt while doing it he also brings some hilariously callous references to mass shooters and some some nice rap God flows to the song lucky you oddly enough I found to be one of the better tracks in the track listing here even if some people don't really care for the featured artists on this thing Joyner Lucas I think his flows on the track are top-notch some of his lyrics are pretty smart and funny the beats not too bad but really the highlight the crown jewel of the track is Eminem's verse where it seems like he has a lyrical moment of clarity admitting that he sold a lot of his artistry up the river to become more famous more popular and that he legitimately took an L for his bad album last year a handful of bar stood out when he was making this point I don't hate trap and I don't want to seem mad but in fact where the old me at the same cat who would take that feedback and aim back I need that yeah I mean that's that's what I'm saying that's what I've been saying where is that guy do you know where that guy is do you have his email or phone number is he coming back anytime soon on the track Matta like Eminem and race to 5/9 hop on top of this take Heath beat that's very much in a style that black boy JB has popularized recently the hook is also like an interpolation of the rain drop drop top bars from the amigos trackpad and bougie there are some worthwhile bars on the track m and Royce have some pretty cool chemistry on the song but for the most part trying to fit their respective styles over this very contemporary sound without much in the way of an appreciation as to how exactly this whole Trap thing works it just kind of feels like they're trying to fit a round peg into a square hole the title track on the album though I dug pretty much have seemed like a kookier older version of Eminem revitalized with some pretty hilarious visuals like riding through someone's cul-de-sac with his windows cracked bumping their reference tracks the beak very much matches the violent and comedic and zany tone of Eminem's lyrics and I think the track also serves as a reminder of how far humor went to make Eminem's older material so much more palatable because honestly these days Eminem's humor is either not landing or it's just not there because he is way too angry and self serious and I actually presume that's because he's legitimately angry and taking himself way too seriously to get a lot of his points across effectively the song fall has a pretty chill spaced out instrumental and a hidden secret feature from Justin Vernon of Bon Iver Fame on the hook it's honestly one of the better sounding songs on the entire record in terms of the instrumental and even Eminem's flow but I feel like Eminem kind of ruins the potential of the song by throwing out some idiotic and horrendous bars at people who didn't really deserve his ire for one Joe Budden I think had some really legitimate criticisms of Eminem's album rollout and the album itself and then with some of the dumbest bars in the entire song he attacks people like Tyler the Creator and Earl and I get that they're some new and contemporary artists that Eminem doesn't like who are well deserving of criticisms that their music is dumb and it's shallow and it's meaningless etc but now you're just bitterly attacking young talented artists who are making better projects than you right now Eminem goes as far as to say don't tell me about the culture I inspired the Hobson's and the logics yeah dude I I don't know if I would retain bragging rights on that on top of that you consistently shit on these younger rappers for being materialistic and mumbly and so on and so forth and just wrap it about their chains meanwhile you helped put on 50 cent look if you guys like 50 cent you like 50 cent and that's fine I'm mostly just annoyed at this constant critique from mm that there's a lot of this new music out there and it's just not that deep meanwhile 50 Cent's catalog isn't exactly profound or anything okay yeah kamikaze overall it's not as bad as revival there is quite a bit of this record that I think is pretty listenable a couple tracks that I actually feel are kind of good but also there is a lot of blissfully ignorant and totally out of touch trash on this thing a good chunk of it is pretty much unlistenable it's pretty much a mixed bag with way more misses than hits even if again there are a few spots where mmm does improve a little bit and seems a bit more aware of his shortcomings and where he might need to go next in order to make his next project more likeable I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing transition have you given this album a listen as you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the

show helps the segment and it gets you something in the process too and let's get in what I felt were the worst tracks of the week starting with this new track from from soul fly you know max tons of respect for the guy because of his is vet status in the metal scene and Sepultura one of the greatest Brazilian metal bands of all time if not the greatest Brazilian metal band of all time but his side-project soul fly has always been a little hit or miss for me very much a odd little new metal project and this new album or album single is what I want to say which is titled ritual is just as primal but also as basic and is overblown as many tracks from soul fly over the years you kind of have some very basic lyrics some jump the fuck up riffs and maybe the weirdest part of the song that's the biggest turn off of it is that you kind of have this new metal scatting all over it really the very thing that Jonathan Davis used to do on old Korn tracks but now soul fly is kind of trying their hand at it and it's really just a mess no I can't say I care for it all that much but whatever it's it's soul fly I guess you probably know what you're getting into at this point with a soul fly song all right after that rust comes out with a another basic boring melodic drab pop rap song with the song serious new record on the way can't say I'm really looking forward to it though Greta Van Fleet has a new track a new single that people have been talking about when the curtain falls now I've talked about this band before I have had my critiques of their stuff like many people have in that they just maybe sound a little bit too much like Led Zeppelin a lot of the time and while it seems like the musicianship has gotten better it seems like the production has gotten better on their new material over here I feel like they have spent that extra technical ability and that extra bit of studio magic on sounding even more like Led Zeppelin than they did before it's like they're they're really just trying to become one with the band and I I guess I wish them all the luck in the world also in the worst tracks section unfortunately is this brand new scar Lorde track while I have enjoyed some of the Lord's previous cuts and have thought his whole approach to the trap sound and aesthetic was pretty cool at this point he's just basically making really bad screamo over a trap beat that's essentially what he's doing at this point he's just kind of screaming his brains out really mellow dramatically with angsty and very very trite lyrics and it sounds just as bad as the screamo that so obviously inspired this did 10 or 15 years ago I mean obviously I'm not knocking all screaming as a whole there's a lot of great screamo out there but not really digging the approach he's taking on this track and the band Bring Me The Horizon has a new track out mantra is the title and yeah it's it's okay I mean I do think the band has become a lot less obnoxious with their sound as of late and has kind of toned down the very awful and lowest-common-denominator metalcore that they have been purveyors of for a long time but it seems like they've settled into instead a very bland and over produced alt metal sound with some fake woke lyrics some very clean and generic male lead vocals and I don't know just just some tight very dime-a-dozen mainstream metal production that kind of died out with time when when this sound in metal used to rule the radio it no longer does and I feel like it disappeared for a reason and for whatever reason the band is just kind of continuing its prolonged unnecessarily prolonged existence with this new single over here so I'm moving out from there Takashi 6-9 has a awful new single out titled baby with n well a a it is a Latin pop slash reggaeton blend the instrumental and Anne Welles vocals on the track are not bad but six 9s very nasally auto-tuned singing voice is absolute garbage and ruins a good chunk of the song maybe this track will get quite a bit of play in Latin pop circles and maybe it will bring more people who aren't typically into that style into that sound both of those things are fine both of those things are good things but really I think six 9s performance is awful and maybe could have been better I mean I don't really know if he had the ability to make it any better than you did so I don't know if I could really say that definitively but I'll just leave it at it being bad alright let's get into the tracks I thought were meh not terrible but not amazing either but certainly worth pointing out pointing to your attention new single slash track from twenty one pilots my blood they have dropped quite a few tracks from this forthcoming album already I did a little track review for this very song on my other channel Fantana youtube.com slash Fantana and I thought it was pretty good I mean there were some elements of the lyrics that I thought were a little stereotypical for twenty one pilots and the intro was a little boring but I thought the disco infused hook the kind of Moody and groovy bass lines and drums on the verses were quite nice again it sort of sounds like twenty one pilots are getting slightly darker and more mature in comparison with their recent material it's not blowing me away but I do think it's a nice change of pace and is making their music a lot more palatable to me than it has been in the past moving on from there the mr. mark mark kozilek is what I want to say under the Sun Kil moon name has a new record on the way new song out titled Linda Blair a little on the fence with it though I was pretty on the fence with some of the material that preceded his last full-length album and some of it did grow me maybe this track will do the same Linda Blair truth be told is a lot to take in in one sitting mark is still very much writing these long-winded slice-of-life song but Linda Blair is easily one of the weirdest that he has dropped so far in that he makes these direct references to Linda Blair in The Exorcist and there are multiple moments and of course this is a descriptive moment on the track where he's trying to tell a story he kind of mimics the sound of Linda Blair like gurgling like vomit in the movie if I remember the direct scene reference correctly I may not but still the the the the effect of that sound is there again multiple times in the track bump which again it does add quite a bit of character to the song it has been one of the more unique experiences I guess I've had listening to a Sun Kil moon track and that mark really does kind of go above and beyond with his lyrics his descriptions his mouth noises and everything the one thing that does kind of turn me off about the track is that again I was just hoping for a bit more of a direct structure here and the guitars I found to be very odd describing them is really an impossibility for me right now I have no idea why they're they're just very strange and persistently weird to the point where I find them kind of distracting away from what Mark is doing vocally and and musically with his story and with his voice it just kind of felt like an odd pairing these kind of layered guitar arpeggios that are a bit disorienting and really overpowering in a way which I think is maybe one of the major downsides of their inclusion in the track but still it does seem like Mark is experimenting continuing to experiment continuing to do new things and continuing to take his usual very narrative very wordy and very linear song stick and just some present some different in new ideas with it so moving on from there Rico nasty has brand-new banger out though it is a little repetitive and one-dimensional it does hit hard and it is a pretty fun quick listen the song wanna do moving on from there poppy has a new track out with Diplo the song is time is up and a lot like Poppy's recent material there are a lot of themes of robotics and futurism and so on and so forth packed into a very punchy pop beat Diplo's production is okay though a little bland I just kind of wish that aesthetically Poppy's music sort of I guess pushed these futuristic robotic boundaries a little bit harder I mean she's definitely there conceptually lyrically and visually to I mean just from her videos and the production in the music video too but the music to me just kind of read like straightforward dance pop in a lot of respects and again I just kind of wish it went a little bit farther conceptually on that end also Muse dropped a new track this week simulation Theory album on the way the dark side is the title of the track and shockingly I didn't mind this song too much it wasn't nearly as terrible as I thought it was going to be yeah it's kind of soaked in this whole 80s a synth Wave aesthetic but I don't really mind it as much as I did a lot of the Bands recent material especially off of drones which I just thought was a god-awful record yeah maybe some of you might think the production is a little stale but it's actually more palatable than some of the rock tracks Muse has been dropping so I don't know I don't really think the tune is that bad either Bellamy's vocals are pretty sweet on the track so overall it's it's cool cut it's cool cut not blowing me away anything or anything but I think it's pretty cool moving on from there pig destroyer new album on the way I have told you guys this before in a previous track roundup they have dropped another song over here though this one to me was kind of underwhelming as well the title is Mount Skull and I I don't know exactly how to describe this subtle music shift that I think pig destroyer has undergone on these past couple of singles which I assume will probably continue throughout the rest of this new album I mean there was a time when it came to extreme metal and grindcore the pig destroyer was one of the most harrowing horrifying and spine-tingling bands on the market and these new couple of tracks I mean they got rifts they're aggressive but they just feel like really meat headed sort of like a bro hardcore band or like a crossover thrash band or something like that and both those genres are cool but but I feel like pig destroyer really kind of had something special that was a bit more distinct and interesting than those music styles but I feel like they've boiled their recent stuff down to I don't know just kind of some really kooky aggressive fast music that doesn't really have much in the way of thrills or chills to it I guess but I don't know maybe that's just the taste or tracks you know maybe the new album will have a bit more I don't know a bit more of a blood curdling factor to it once the album drops I guess we'll see moving out from there button B has a new album out now this new single recognize is a pretty catchy one featuring Big KRIT and T I do give it do give it a shot it's got a nice southern hip-hop flavor even if I do think some of bun B's lyrics and flows are a little basic and let's get into the tracks I thought were the best this week whoo we have quite a few one this band over here on Bandcamp they have a little EP out that I want you guys to give a shot the name of the band is trash light honey insulation it's a pretty experimental noisy and abrasive piece of post-punk and death rock it's really nasty the performances on this EP are incredible the production is really nasty and deadly and hard-hitting and yeah I mean the band just sounds listing as fuck and I just respect the hell out of that but not from their Neenah cherry has another song produced by Four Tet and 3d of portishead Fame the track shotgun Shack it's got some beautiful vocals nice groovy beat that is pretty sweet on the ears moving out from their mera Indy Vette mera ordinary day is the nice new quaint and eerie little folk tune that she has dropped this week that is quite nice I highly recommend it it is very sweet Mount Erie fans do take note moving on from there Milo has a new album on the way stet is the title of this new track from this forthcoming project it's a beautiful little abstract hip hop song with some lush production and some pretty smart straightforward and thoughtful bars from mr. Milo himself as to be expected you know it just feels a lot bolder than some of the side project and collaborative projects stuff he's been dropping lately it is always nice to hear Milo really kind of hunker down on a powerful piece of solo material after he's kind of indulged in some extracurricular stuff moving on from there Mick Jenkins dropped a song like very very very early this week it was like just before or after I dropped the last weekly track roundup that I noticed it and yeah super lyrical hard-hitting a great production great performance great vocal and flow delivery on this track so really digging what Mick is doing here hoping he can kind of get it get it together on a new album as I thought his last full-length LP was a little all over the place and pretty underwhelming didn't have quite as much bite as this track over here does so it is nice to hear Mick with some fire in his belly once again moving on from there Laura Jane grace of against me Fame under the name Laura Jane grace and the devouring mothers has this new track Apocalypse Now and later and it is a rowdy wild socially charged obviously piece of fault rock with nice kind of abrasive somewhat low five production and yeah this is actually the most exciting I have found her songwriting to be in a long time you know even under the against me name the last few records really kind of underwhelming this track though hit hard and I thought was pretty incredible so do not miss out on this one it's a good it's a good solid piece of punky and melodic full crock moving on from there shout out to the band kitten who are continuing to drop singles with a very bright shiny dramatic and emotionally potent kind of 80s pop and rock edge to it these songs that I'm referencing here are secrets and mercury digging where the band is going on this new batch of tracks and want to give a shout out to this death metal band over here titled grievous that's the name of the band over there inert is the name of their new song they have a new record out hit up on Bandcamp and yeah it's it's a nice technical multifaceted heavy sour dark despondent piece of experimental death metal with I don't know some really interesting guitar passages and some very brutal vocals I'm kind of liking the dark and tortured atmosphere the band brings without going I guess overly abrasive you know I do like some abrasive death metal but it seems like while the band's music is harsh and it is deadly it it feels like to me that their focus is more on creating a supremely dark and I guess almost like in a cult atmosphere as opposed to just kind of sounding like I don't know a really gruesome be horror movie or something like that next clipping have a new track out titled stab him in the throat which is a part of the Rick and Morty universe in that it's going to be featured on the forthcoming Rick and Morty soundtrack and it sounds just as experimental and nasty and catchy as many great clipping songs do and I think that has been the weekly track roundup everybody again a limited time only our squat the nice squat tano's squat jars are here they're limited grab one while you can all that extra stuff that I said that you guys could get earlier in the raffle and on top of that the signature of the stickers the review notes the exclusive podcasts also come with it supports the show supports the segment supports the channel and you get something out of it too thank you very much to anybody who does grab them and has grabbed them I'm going to be packing what has been bought of them so far this week and again that's it that link in the amazon link the turntable lab link and all of the songs that i have mentioned in this video down below yeah i'll catch you guys in the next one anthony Fantana weekly track roundup for 
5T_sTOTUGWc,"[Music] give yourselves a hand for clicking on this new episode of it came from band camp where I go across the band camp platform finding not so much what's great but really what's what's so strange that maybe some people aren't aren't really talking about it so let's go so this first album I'm gonna be talking about is from a person by the name of Mertz palty this is actually a fan of the show sent their band camp in not necessarily to be submitted to this program but still I I thought it fit spall t is kind of an electronic music producer who occasionally pulls in some vocal samples from videos and a variety of other things from the internet it comes out pretty serene pretty glitchy pretty intriguing pretty mind-bending during its best moments so I don't know let's give it a shot let's see what's going on I feel like I'm just calculating the song out in my head as I'm listening to it I love how consistently bright and strange a lot of the atmospheres are but then also how I guess kind of disjointed and deconstructed the compositional elements and the rhythms of these tracks are its creative super out there very fun to listen to it's kind of like listening to the auditory equivalent to a really cool digital 3d rendering of psychedelic image or some kind of colourful shape or something but then it's being twisted and glitched out as it's rotating or something I like it it's cool this next record that we have over here comes from one celesta phone also kind of a fan and a friend of the show who has been throwing his music my way for a little while now he is a rapper and I think you will find celesta phones delivery and rap style to be wholly unique let's say that much [Music] [Music] yeah I'm really not sure what to to liken this to there's definitely not anything coming up in the rap world in my mind immediately that this reminds me of I actually feel like I'm listening to the hip-hop equivalent of Daniel Johnston the more that I think about a man that's wow so much I mean the instrumentals are unlike a lot of what I've heard on many rap albums the the flows are actually decent outside of I don't know the the bit of tempo issues that he's kind of having here and there though there's clearly an intended sloppiness to a lot of these recordings and then there's just that that damn nasally it sounds like something out of a weird cartoon which I'm not necessarily against in in principle I mean even the cover of this thing looks like a weird ass cartoon yeah after a while of listening to it I kind of decided that maybe I feel like it's a little too weird for me personally but it's also too weird not to mention and not to share and not to push out there to see you know where could this go maybe a lot of people will enjoy this a lot more than me because this this is this is strange this is strange but intriguing and clearly there's some cool technical aspects to it as well and it's it's legit experimental and sort of adventurous too so definitely unique personality in in the underground hip hop realm to say the least okay this next record that I'm going to be talking about here on the band camp platform is from one Jeff which sure whitshire it's called approximately 1,000 beers apparently this is kind of a weird experimental music project with deconstructed country the entire album is pretty brief and features a lot of glitchy strange robotic stretched out country music how does this accidentally sound like something that would be in a David Lynch movie or like in an episode of Twin Peaks [Music] he started to town on a nice sunny day little did we know that our look had flown away there are times in life when you feel so free and there are times in life when it's not meant to be got them [Music] this is this is a fucking this is a fucking David Lynch album and it's secret and it's been thrown onto the internet and and I I found it yeah this this is actually weirdly compelling believe it or not to me I I find this attractively freakish it's kind of mind-bending but it's also really hilarious in a very smart and in self-aware way and I like that I like that goddamnit this next album off the Bandcamp platform also involves a bit of satire but much less in the way of explanation it's from a band by the name of neckbeard death camp the title of this record is white nationalism is for basement-dwelling losers if you didn't hear it let me say the title of that one more time what nationalism is for basement-dwelling losers yeah that's pretty much the name of this thing and it's it's pretty much like a grind quarry crust punky black metal ish noisy extreme rock project whose lyrics and themes just pretty much make fun of all writers and all that shit so let's give it a shot the first selection I will play off of this album is called in cell warfare not that they need to be read to you because you could clearly hear them right there but the lyrics of this song are as follows this nation has a problem with greasy boys and cargo shorts who feel a hoot a woman under threat of murder you are a stick without a carrot a tripple hook without a worm I'm sick and tired of turning on the news to see another coward caught alive in custody in cell warfare not even human okay the little album slash EP here also features such hits as the left are the real fascists and zyklon-b is in slash B slash random born on 4chan also the fetishization of Asian women despite a demand for a pure white race outro it's a fun little project you know fun fun fun anti-nazi grindy black medley stuff for the for the whole family next on the list here I want to shout out the Yona album see Yona is actually an AI pop artist slash singer developed by super producer and creative mind mr. ash Cuccia who I have covered on the channel a few times before so what you are hearing here is is the results of the input of an AI so this is like AI music AI singing so if the reality which some people tell me is coming that we're just going to be listening to a bunch of computer-generated music in the future and all the pop stars years from now we'll it will just be Holograms maybe this is the first step toward that that this this and this and Vocaloid I guess but you know I think this is maybe a more interesting step in that direction [Music] I think that's pretty cool I think there's a lot of potential in that maybe if the vocal melody were maybe a bit more logical and fit over the chords a bit better and felt less like the voice was just talking I think this could be a lot sweeter and a lot more I guess appealing I feel like Jana just like out poppy poppy on on this recording over here strangely enough Jana check this band camp out it's pretty it's pretty unique shout out to ash Cuccia you're the best okay this next one Austin brought to the table not as familiar with this project it comes from one mic shifflett tetra cosa volume 8 so volume 8 of what you asked apparently tetra cosa is a 24 hour piece being released over the course of 2018 and 8 3-hour installments involves 350 unique sound objects categorized and layered such that no two movements of this album sound alike some objects are constrained to a single hour or volume and others spanning the 24 hour duration so a pretty unique concept project over here again we're on volume 8 12 tracks on this thing some spanning 21 minutes some 16 some 12 15 let's just give track 7 a shot shot in the dark here let's go and see what's up and then and they're all titled after the runtime so this is our 22 31 minutes 33 seconds and 36 milliseconds and we have a pretty nice serene ambient drown here with what sounds like bees buzzing and they would electronic effect you know if you are gonna make a drone I I do like a good texture drone that feels nice and dense you can kind of swim in it and you're catching a lot of vibes a lot of sounds a lot of layers and mike has certainly provided that here very quickly already by the 1-minute mark of this track jumping to another track let's just go track nine see what's up with that one well that's frightening all right it's for this very frightening all right let's uh let's move on to another band camp over here one from mr. Galen Tipton night bath is the name of this record features a cute little freaky weird crab thing on the front cover let's give the song Whisperer a shot shall we I don't think this is the case but the the speed at which whatever sounds I'm hearing have been brought up too it sounds like the melody is all around the mulberry bush or something but just just a guess [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] Wow this is really cool this is strange this sounds like what would happen if you had a member of the PC music crew guide the music production decisions of someone from an insane asylum and had them had them try to to produce a jock jam I love these super speedy bright insane colorful trends that are coming out of electronic music and just beat production right now I just find them so refreshing and just a nice change of pace from not only the dark and atmospheric but also the very self serious music that I hear coming out of EDM and in a lot of beat music these days again it's it's it's a kind of a breath of fresh air [Music] this is this is quite good at Austin just threw this in here I don't even notice this was so good I don't even know this is gonna be so good damn this is this is so weird and one more thing we are going to have to add to this insane episode of it came from band camp goes by the name of melodic plays kids see ghosts under the name melodic on Bandcamp and it just seems that this person applies the melodica to a lot of different covers and interpretations of various artists and albums out there so I think we're pretty much in for what the the title says let's give it a shot [Music] so good bot navigator I'm talking the coast looks a mess to be a trick Rob's nut up she see me always okay click clearly we're not just working with melodica here because if this were merely just one person who let's say we're I'm a lot of curve virtuoso and and I'm sure they're out there trying to honestly recreate the music of kids see ghosts maybe it could be kind of cool but clearly this individual was using a their amateurish charm to put across the the laziest and most cobbled together take possible okay let's give a shot to one of my favorite tracks on here maybe one of the most emotionally potent moments on the album reborn let's let's give that a shot let's see what melodic does with with that amazing track [Music] not not nearly as bad as I anticipated it it was going to be definitely could have been worse [Music] and that has been the latest installment of it came from band camp guys thank you for watching over here next to my head transition is another episode of the it came from band camp series if you want to check it out and kind of go back into the series get recommended more strange band camp pages also you can hit me link to subscribe to the channel next to my head on the screen to also remember to hit the bell as well to get a reminder for when we come out with a new video and yeah that's it I'll see you guys in the next one anthony Fantana it came from band camp hot dad did the theme song forever "
gJltJ5WeGvA,uh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new interpol album marauder this is the latest full-length album from legendary indie & post-punk band Interpol the band's trajectory over the past 20 years has pretty much become a trope in popular music at this point band makes grand entrance into the music scene with a pretty much picture-perfect debut album and then they sort of spend the rest of their careers living in the shadow of that album never really quite being able to outdo it or really create anything that seems totally out of the purview of it whether it be the band trying to stick to their guns for a pretty formidable follow up on their sophomore full-length LP or bringing in a bunch of very syrupy atmospheric grand extra lavish instrumentation on their self-titled record in 2010 and then going back to basics in a way on Alpen tour a few years ago in 2014 and at this point on marauder Interpol still kind of sounds like they're at a loss for what to do I was somewhat excited going into this album by the rough and wild performances I heard on teaser tracks like the rover even if the mixing and paul banks yell p vocals were a bit weird it still seemed like the band were on the verge of something new and refreshing but the exciting new direction I hoped Interpol would pull through with on this album is just not here nor would I call this album the mild return to form that pin tour was either instead marauder pretty much sounds like the same moody driving post-punk that Interpol is known for but presented with sloppy or writing production and performances there is an unnecessary amount of reverb on a lot of these tracks to the point where the guitars the vocals are really just bleeding into one another in a very unlikable way it's like they cancel each other out and create this bland sonic slop and when the band manages to throw on a few extra layers of vocals or guitars it just feels like I'm listening to really bad shoegaze the sound the tone the tambour of this recording it's just really dull and dry and gray and the performances the playing on this thing that they don't really help either like the twang e and repetitive desert rock guitar leads on the tracks stay in touch they get very tedious very fast and the only thing that really distracts from them are the horrid swells of cymbals Paul banks voice in these weird wailing guitar leads that sound very sour there are also some weird rhythm guitars in the second-leg that do anything but emphasize the rhythm of the track I hear the band making some attempts at trying some new stuff doing something to shake things up in their typical sound but usually it does not go over too well especially when Paul tries to switch up his vocal delivery which in theory is not necessarily a bad thing but why his instincts went toward hey let's just hang in my upper register and get really yell pee like on the song party's over which was such a slog to listen to the track almost feels like a statement on the album itself the party's over please and even when Interpol is just resting on their laurels and trying to pull off their usual shtick it's really underwhelming the chai me driving rhythm guitars that Interpol are usually known for like on the track surveillance are really really sloppy and come together in a pretty messy fashion which is sort of a shame because it sounds like at the core of the track we have a very good song here as Paul singing on the verses kills it and his haunting demeanor on the hook is is fantastic his forlorn kroons are really despondent vocally I think it is one of the more powerful moments on the record but instrumentally one of the most lackluster and it's one of many moments on this album where it does sound like the song is pretty decent but the the full potential of it isn't realized because of a very lackluster presentation this is also an issue with the opening track the closing track - there's just so much on this album that is holding it back it's it's actually frustrating like the super rough and squawking rhythm guitars on the track complications really the worst rhythm guitar on the entire LP and not just because of the sour and horrid chord progression but the tone is super thin overly sharp it doesn't really enhance the rhythm of the track that much there were at least a handful of songs that I thought sounded pretty great from start to finish Interpol doing what they do well the song flight of fancy had a pretty fantastic driving groove the guitars and bass felt very locked in solid drumbeat to paul's vocals or captivating it feels dark it feels authoritative sort of thrilling to a rare moment of potent emotion on the album the song mountain child is a pretty nice slow burner with a patient introduction it slowly builds up with some dramatic bass and drums and it's one of the few moments on this album where the band throws on these extra guitars these extra sonic layers it does get a little overwhelming sonically but it's pretty enjoyable the band's experimental desires on this record in a way fully realized the tune at the core of this sonic chaos is pretty solid as well Paul's vocals on the pre-chorus when they kind of reach into that upper register and strain a bit are pretty fantastic the hook is one of the smoothest on the entire record and the song missamma as well I thought I had some super tight playing the guitars the drums the bass once again super locked in on tempo doesn't feel like the band are playing is super loose for absolutely no reason at all which I mean there is certainly an appeal to I have praised multiple records on here that are a little rough around the edges maybe they're a little amateurish maybe they're just kind of wild and out of control that can be great that can add a lot to an album but if that was Interpol's intention with some of the tracks on this record like you could have brought it so much further than where you did I'm just having a hard time finding the appeal of this album because by the usual standards Interpol set on a record this fall's horribly short it is messy at points it feels under written the vocal performances are kind of off the production is very washed out but it's also kind of hard to see this album as a novelty or refreshing or experimental because not just in the grander scheme of things but also within the scope of Interpol's very limited discography this is not very adventurous it just feels like a noisier and sloppier version of the band we've been listening to for all these years and truth be told I could not wait for this album to be over I'm feeling strong for to a light five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you look did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Interpol forever 
KMc_N5ziha0,hi everyone Johnny Johnny yes Papa eating sugar no papa telling lies no Papa open your mouth hey Anthony Fanta no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new blood orange album Negro Swan this is the fourth album from songwriter producer multi-instrumentalist Devante Hinds aka blood orange this is a pretty exciting time in devs career after hitting some pretty personal lows in the first half of this decade his music has only gotten more ambitious and his influence as a songwriter and a producer can be felt in more legs of the music industry as he can be heard writing and working with the likes of Solange Knowles and Sky Ferreira even the fantastic Carly Rae Jepsen and performing with the likes of Philip Glass and he has been growing the blood orange name too with albums that have shown improvements on all musical fronts like his last full-length LP freetown sound and even though I wasn't in love with this LP it did sound like dev was elevating his usually Airy and sensual blend of synth funk and contemporary R&B and pop with better instrumentation less overbearing reverb more tangible songs and even social commentary and that growth continues on to this new record over here which I think in a lot of ways feels like Freetown sound somatically and aesthetically but in comparison with that previous record I think Swan is a sweeter a bolder a prettier record it's more instrumentally lush and has some pretty impressive guest performances too Hinds songwriting across this record though is still pretty loose it's very vibe which is partially what made Freetown sound so underwhelming for me at points it was very blissful but didn't have a whole lot of impact or strong song structures and even though the bulk of the material on this new album is pretty light on the ears it pretty euphoric I will say that instrumentally and compositionally there are a lot more highlights a lot more bold standout moments so even if many of the songs on this record are kind of short and aren't necessarily plugged into these very well regulated and tight pop structures you still do have tracks on this thing like st. which features some very bright and emotive lead vocals in a sensual R&B style kind of sounds like a throwback to the 80s there are also some echo drenched sax leads on this thing too as well as a supremely catchy and tremendous vocal finish with lots of harmony is a very nice refrain there's also the over-the-top lead vocals and the gospel melodies on the track holy will which in some respects I kind of read is doing too much which is kind of a theme of phrase that comes up on the album but I do like the odd and strip back instrumental some of the weird background vocal placement - it feels like I'm listening to our gospel or deconstructed gospel also the rich grand piano chords the gorgeous lead vocals that kick off the first leg of the song hope also a stunningly beautiful moment on the album don't get it twisted even though this record is pretty dreamy aesthetically for a majority of its runtime that doesn't mean it necessarily seeks to put you to sleep or that it's kind of hiding details in the haze and the reverb and the echo it's certainly not even the song jewelry which is easily one of the dreamiest tracks here has some moody rap verses some fantastic vocal harmonies and some jazzy saxs that all stand out really nicely Devante does give listeners a lot to chew over and think about instrumentally on the album it's a pretty engaging record but simultaneously it's very chill it's very laid-back a lot of the songs on this thing kind of bleed into one another as particular runs of tracks on this record feel almost like chapters in a book this is something I had a bit of an issue with on freetown sound but I would say what Swann does so much better than that album is that it's not like I'm listening to a mere motif of a song and then it disappears into the ether and goes away I think a lot of the short and very fluid tracks on this album rien force each other really well as a holistic experience I think tracks 1 through 5 are a pretty key example of that just before the track 6 we're transgender activists and TV host Janet mock can be heard engaging in a in an interview clip where she is talking about her own definition of family it's a beautiful moment and sentiment on the album that plays right into the next track charcoal baby thematically a song all about wanting to feel accepted not wanting to be the odd one out which is a pretty key message for the entire album whether it be finding comfort in your own skin or finding a place or people that allow you to be yourself be that best version of you that you can be and the truest version of yourself that you can be it's a pretty empowering message which is obviously geared directly toward people of color and members of the LGBTQ community reminding them to be unafraid to express themselves and and oh it to themselves to be themselves which is a nice thought there are also lots of beautiful sounds throughout this entire record but don't go into this album assuming it's just going to be one big attempt to blow smoke up the asses of the people that Devante intends to contact with this music because as pretty as a lot of the songs and instrumentation on this album are there is a very haunting sense of isolation on this album - there's also a pretty clear sense of fear when it comes to the current state of culture as well I think there's some smart philosophical sloganeering on the album here and there - like on the track nappy wonder I think it's pretty safe to say that once you dive into the messaging of a lot of the lyrics on this record it is as thoughtful as it is beautiful however there are some moments here where it seems to kind of fall short on those fronts like the ASAP rocky feature yeah there's a wrapped and sung a SAP rocky feature right dab smack in the middle of the LP which doesn't really add much to the album's sound nor its messaging it just seems really out of place and it's one of the most Awkward appearances of any artists on the record really the most awkward no question and still at this point I do find some of the songs on this record to be a bit too impressionist with a kind of weak song structure in tune I mean sure the aesthetic is nice the vibe is nice but maybe it doesn't connect to the surrounding tracks all that tightly I don't get that same sense of reinforcement so as a result some songs on this thing do just feel like these very underwhelming micro versions of songs like on Dagenham Dream holy will I have to give a nod to unfortunately and also this track toward the end of the record Mineta Creek which oddly enough reminded me of something Ariel Pink would do on an older record for some reason there are a few weird performances and instrumental mixes on the album as well but I took that as more of an interesting character trait because from what I understand the songs on this album we're all created and recorded under a variety of different circumstances which leads to some very uniquely varied results across the album tracklist and puts this album in a state that's kind of tough to describe in one breath Devante Hinds does a great job of making sure all of these tracks come together in a beautifully uniformed and again holistic and in blissful way but stylistically and aesthetically the album is really all over the place too as it just kind of sounds like a lot of these tracks came together in a very raw in a creative fashion just as Hinds was literally in a series of different settings for a lot of these songs I feel like I as listener and being transported to different places with a lot of the tracks here and the fact that they link and thread and fade into one another so nicely across the tracklisting only adds to the excitement of the variety because it does feel connected it does feel as I said before very fluid this is easily one of the prettiest brightest and enjoyable vibe albums I guess you could say that I've heard this year it is gorgeous aesthetically and more pelling in my opinion than anything Heinz is released up until this point there are moments where I wish the songwriting was a bit more of a focus or that there were more tracks on this record that could be pulled out of the context of the album and be enjoyed merely by themselves kind of in a single type state but there's still very little material that I think you can do that with on this record because I think the experience and the enjoy ability of this project comes very much down to the larger the more macro picture than any kind of micro type focus on a single track a single song a single moment because of that reinforcement because of the way the tracks kind of build on top of each other and again what's so surprising and so fantastic about that is that so many of the songs on this thing especially the moments where Heinz is throwing interview clips in your face that sort of thing it feels kind of like a scrapbook of experiences I think I'm going to leave it at that hopefully I've done what exactly this album is trying to achieve justice because there are a lot of great things about it and it certainly was an experience that I loved going through this year I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i er v next hit the light feel like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the Bell is well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana music forever 
N0VWqq5BPlc,but hi everyone the Maverick here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new oh C's album smoke reverser this is a brand new album from john dwyer and the gang o sees the San Fran's psyche and garage rock outfit who has been on a pretty creative streak lately with a run of albums that have featured some of the Bands best production and musical performances yet mutilator defeated at last a weird exits their previous full-length record orc and now they are pretty much adding to this electrifying new direction with SMO traverser and there were quite a few reasons that I was psyched for this record these past few records have marked a really exciting time in the OCS discography where the band is taking their psyche and garage roots and delivering unto us these punked out sometimes kraut rocky and jams in these styles that are pretty cutting-edge with great performances and chemistry solid and tight solos the cover on this thing looks incredible seems like some kind of interdimensional being or a beast from the depths of hell is rising up and destroying the whole world looking forward to that and one of the big teaser tracks to this record overthrown kinda sounded like o'seas going metal but without losing touch with their psyche and garage roots the track seemed like it could be the next chapter in this sort of explosive leg of the band's discography overall though now that I've been able to hear the entire album smote unfortunately is not that wall-to-wall exciting next chapter in the band's discography though I do think it is a solid addition to this latest string of albums overthrown as great as the track is with its intense and speedy drumming the really abrasive guitars and vocals which are just scorched with Distortion the wailing guitar leads to the track is kind of an anomaly in the tracklist the closest of the band comes again to sounding this murderous and satanic is on the track Andrey KL Cobra door which has very devilish lead vocals some fuzzy bass some expressive drum fills seems like the band are kind of pulling a page out of the Black Sabbath playbook and dipping it in LSD it's kind of a fun take but there are a bunch of tracks from the band's last album that blow this one out of the water in terms of character and heaviness and intensity namely the song animated violence whose metal appeals I think I appreciate a lot more in retrospect I digress though the issue that I have with this album generally a lot of tracks on it is that they go pretty far but do they go far enough in comparison with some of aussies recent works a lot of the material awesomo reverser is not nearly as risky the performances are kind of mild and some of the ideas here are a little ill-conceived like the tracks see which is a pretty steamy groovy very nicely paced piece of psychedelic blues-rock with these cheeky falsetto vocals delivering these kind of creepy lyrics about creatures crawling in the morning light there are some sweet solo passages it's not a bad tune but throughout the entire track there are these really persistent field recordings of like a field at night where you just hear a lot of crickets chirping I like the extra bit of texture it adds to some points in the song but at the volume that it's at throughout the entire recording I just don't see what it adds meanwhile the track sentient una is a nice slow burner with chilling vocal harmonies primal drums and explosive organ passage all of this is presented in a pretty linear fashion but considering the amount of time the track takes to build all this up it's kind of an odd choice for an intro as it's not exactly the most accurate tone setter for the entire record it doesn't really feel like that grande of an entrance it just feels like I've been thrown into a record that's already been playing for 15 minutes before I arrived the track last piece has a lot of great things going for it it's weepy fiddles it's kind of downtrodden background vocals but the song the instrumentation pretty much everything about this track is really faint weirdly eq'd and mixed kind of buried the only thing about it that's upfront and clear are the drums which are oddly raw and don't feel like they have been treated all that carefully I mean I get the band typically embraces some loafie aesthetics and their recordings but the way the instrumentation on this track has been balanced for the first leg just reads like I'm listening to a demo but then there's a total shift in sound and style with this very intense krautrock Ian Jam for the entire second half of the track which is great it's actually one of the most exciting moments on the entire record but it doesn't change the fact that track had a very rough start then there's the longest song on the entire record anthemic aggressor which is very much a head scratcher it's 12 minutes in length and comes off as one of the album's most improvisational moments to the band gives themselves a lot of space to color with but what do they do with it outside of some faintly glitched out barely audible constantly dipping in and out guitars with some really aimless noodling - it just kind of sounds like I'm listening to a radio signal fade out as I'm driving away from it the soloing does get tedious after a while and the track really does not justify its length all that well outside of maybe throwing on some sour harmonies there's a kind of climactic and intense finish which features more layers of instrumentation something I wish there was a bit more of throughout the track I do give it to the rhythm section on the track though the steady bass the fantastic drums on this cut are very much what holds the whole thing together the song flies bump against the glass is one of those slow groovy moments that warrants a crowd of people kind of waving lighters in the air but given the kind of a cult tone of the keyboards on the track maybe less lighters and more floor candles assembled into a pentagram either way the track feels kind of like an endless introduction that never quite resolves and just sort of fizzles out at the end after almost five minutes of less than flattering guitar leads and soloing then there's the very mystical but uneventful closing track on this thing beat quest whose wah-wah-wah lead synth melodies really kind of bury a lot of what else is in the mix and is really kind of a blemish on the track please don't take my critiques of this album as being incredibly harsh because in all honesty there's very little material on this record that I would say is so bad that I wish to skip it and there are at least several very great cuts on this record that I think stand out really well again overthrow intro track is fantastic abysmal earn which features these really fiery explosive electrifying lead guitars it's really rebellious it's wild it's got some solid verses to some lyrics about what seems like our troubled generation the song nail house needle boys has one of the best grooves on the entire record I'll be wailing harmonized guitar leads this sort of ascends as the track is propelling forward the bluesy electric piano riffs on this cut are really nice too and the song moon bog is one of the most truly frightening ballads on this record and really of the Bands past several overall I just think SMO traverser is okay it's just a little hit or miss not nearly as exciting as what the band has been doing for the past few years and that's kind of it much of what has made the Bands recent material so exciting does translate over on to this new LP but with less compelling songs and solos and jams less ambition fewer risks I'm not really sure what comes next for OCS after this album but the band is always changing up the script so regardless there will be reason to check out the the new one I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this one transition have you given this record

tHMY3JKSEoo,hi everyone hand the knee wrote a note here and the Internet's busiest music nerd and rap is emo hip hop's sensitive new wave over the past couple of years I've noticed that there has been a growing flood of artists and also a demand for these artists in the rap community that are really emotional guys like the late little peep and xxx 10 Tasi own there's also juice world who is super hot right now and explores a lot of themes of relationships and sadness and heartbreak in his music also have to shout out trippy red for his new LP on which there are tracks where he is literally singing with these nasally whiney emo style vocals over like just guitar tracks also on a shout out goth boy clique and though I wouldn't necessarily connect these artists directly to this new flood of emo influence in hip-hop I do see a similar sense of angst and insecurity and sensitivity in the music of artists like Brock Hampton and post Malone - and also on top of it what the hell is little Aziz EXO tour life if not an emo anthem waiting to get out I mean have you heard that Fame on fire cover now look sadness and security angst emotion in hip-hop in general is nothing new altogether and the roots of what we're seeing today can be traced back to some emotional anomalies in the genre in the 80's and 90's or to even larger artists who would hit it big in the 2000s like Drake and Kanye West also shout-out to Kid Cudi an atmosphere because they were on that emotional shit - and all those bad bands who put emo and rap music together on MySpace but the thing about Drake and Kanye is that the way that they portrayed themselves and their music the way they kind of exposed their vulnerabilities and went a lot deeper emotionally than a lot of other of their contemporaries did that's what made them unique that's what made them stand out these days Kanye and Drake they're kind of the tea bags that got dropped into the water soaked into the culture and and changed the tone the sensitivity and the emotional see that they have put in their songs has almost become the standard thanks to this new wave of hyper emotional rappers / singers of course along this evolutionary plane I don't want to forget to mention other artists who were kind of precursors to this even newer wave people like yung lean and the sadboy crew of course young thug and I've already made a video talking about how guys like little yadi are representative of hip hop's punk phase at the moment and other artists in the underground - I would say Danny Brown Death Grips basically anybody over the past several years who has participated in this aggressive hardcore and sometimes industrial blend of hip hop music this voluntary breakdown of the genres traditional standards whether it be an instrumental standard whether it be a lyrical or a flow standard there have been numerous artists over the years who seem to have drawn a lot of attention to themselves by bringing the lyrical bar lower and lower and lower and lower whether that be a Soulja Boy a little be a waka flocka flame achieve Keith a little pump and I think a part of this total breakdown of all the standards is also recognizing that there are emotional standards set in place - not just technical ones the artists who I mentioned early on in the video I think are consciously or subconsciously realizing that and throwing out this need to adhere to these usually macho and stoic and super masculine themes that typically turn up in hip hop lyrics I'm not seeing an all-out abandonment of this stuff though I think it will be a while before that even happens but it's clear that you do have a new young crop of artists and listeners who are exploring other emotional avenues like a very young teenage angst and truth be told I do find it kind of refreshing even if some of the music from the artists I mentioned early on I have found to be kind of lackluster and I do wonder how long will it take for this trend if it does rise to the top to just become another self-centered cash cow like pop emo was about 10 or 15 years ago because a lot of this while it is refreshing and new can easily be boiled down to a very predictable formula which one male rapper after another will no problem copying and pasting over even if the whole style is supposed to be based on supposedly authentic emotions I'm kind of seeing Inklings of that already although whatever great and refreshing albums do come out of this new trend I wholeheartedly welcome and am looking forward to and I think that's what I wanted to say I just kind of wanted to give a nod to this growing sound and style that's obviously been going on for a little bit but now it seems like its roots are in the ground a bit deeper and it's worth kind of putting a pin in it's worth marking because it doesn't seem like it's it's going anywhere anytime soon it will be interesting to see what the results of this emotional awakening are I guess and I'm gonna leave it at that leave your thoughts your counterpoints and even suggestions for other artists who you think fit into this wave into this trend down in the comments below thank you guys very much for watching transition have you given these artists and this new wave of emo raps listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana email forever 
5wzAij917v4,ah hi everyone Anthony for you here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new hermit and the Rekluse album Orpheus vs. the sirens this is the new debut album from the hip hop duo the hermit and the Rekluse which you might think is a brand new duo that nobody's ever heard of yet but it in fact features two guys who have quite a bit of weight in the hip hop underground producer Annie moss who is maybe most notable for his frequent and close collaborations with mr. rock Marciano and also Brownsville's own kha whose music I've covered on the channel a few times already I highly recommend his album the Knights gambit if you're unfamiliar with Chi you should know that the dude has a totally idiosyncratic rap style his verses have flow but hit a very slow relaxed pace almost similar to that of spoken word his delivery is pretty low-key to say the least so because he's not hitting listeners with these speedy runs of bars he takes the time to write these really dark poetic verses that you can really stew in and think over a lot like a Pusha T cos is very much quality over quantity of the lyrics that you're hearing in any given song but while consistently brings coded lingo smart wordplay vivid imagery truth be told it's not very hard-hitting it's not very physical because khat is not an author of bangers rather he uses hip-hop to create a theater of the mind like experience where the grim criminal themes in his storytelling are presented in kind of a dramatic and noir fashion and producer animus is very well-suited to fit this tone fit cause style given his ability to support the supremely subdued rock marciano working with a guy like COD just seems like a natural fit it's clear both parties have quite a bit in common artistically and maybe even personally too just given the pseudonym of both musicians on this record the Hermit and the Rekluse basically interchangeable terms and there is something supremely solitary isolating and maybe even anti-social about the music that they make together on this album there is a lyric on the album where Koz says there's purity and obscurity which says a lot about his musics ethos but with that also comes a helping of mythos on this album with the clear nod to Greek mythology via Orpheus as tidbits of his story from the argonautica are presented throughout this album via samples of an adaptation I'm not sure which one that kind of segues the album from one track to another in an attempt to draw parallels between the musical mission of Orpheus himself and animus and kah as a duo in this collaboration using music as a tool to charm and inspire and drown out the destructive sirens that figuratively in this case are causing sailors to crash their boats into the rocks given that this is a Cobham of course this whole Greek mythology thing is much more than skin-deep as it runs through many of the lyrics on this record as well as the participants in the Argonauts story that they're out a question for the golden fleece which Kyle so names a song after and that golden fleece is a symbol a symbol for something that he gets into in the lyrics lonely streets not known for peace never rest forever quest Golden Fleece Golden Fleece the Argonauts I want compassion from the highest food for the lowest cures for the afflicted all rules for the homeless direction for the misled heat for the coldest love for the lonely peace for the soldiers the instrumentals on this album almost without exception are beautiful they're eerie they set a wonderful tone for cause lyrics I love the gorgeous and airy string samples throughout the track sirens the dramatic and cinematic funk-rock passages on the track fate the chilling and experimental New Age ambience of the song Argo the droney synthesizers and soaring psychedelic guitar leads on the cut Orpheus nearly everything on this album sounds like it was sampled out of like an exploitation film soundtrack in the 70s but somehow warped manipulated adjusted and embellished to sound really depressing now in the grander scheme of things maybe this album isn't that much different than a lot of the material cajas put out in the past though I will say I do think this album surpasses honor killed the samurai and his recent kind of underwhelming doctor yen low project and for a few different reasons I mean this album is super short super tight at 10 tracks in 30 minutes the Greek mythology themes that run throughout are pretty smart and captivating and make this record a very unique experience also Kai I find to be lyrically sharper than ever as there are countless quotables flowing throughout this entire album too many to name honestly I would have to just read through the lyrics for the rest of this review though I will try to read off of a couple that stood out to me left to fill dressed to kill nothing I wore peaceful most these fucks is ducks don't let them all geese you geese you I love it I love this set of bars right here but it's kind of a twister because of the internal rhymes living livid I ain't pivot when it was pivotal since NATO held a stable and shit it was most critical how I'm unique is if I speak it I have visual but careful because everything I say is admissible and the third verse of the punishment of Sisyphus really to me is is one of the strongest on the entire record and should put cot in a position for anybody who cares about lyrics to be considered one of the best writers in hip-hop genre of this decade learned many lessons from women the biggest was forgiveness impossibly generosity taught me giving is a privilege fought for respect had to be the villain of the village cuz the only ones chillin was the ones willing to pillage armed for strong-arm and too impatient to plan a heist and how you handle fights determine if you man or mice but soon taught the same true sport if you a fan of life start to gather what you rather six-feet or get hand a vise I choose the OP to excuse a lot just don't deceive me not at all spoiled if the hard-boiled never got over easy where it's clear it's never acceptable to turn to Jake's I impress to you become a vegetable or learn this stakes so there are a few lyrical tidbits from the record that I think are really great but if you want to get that pure sense of drama and cautionary storytelling that is so potent on this album you have to listen to the entire thing you have to listen to a full track now even though this album might not be the most groundbreaking thing in rap most groundbreaking thing for kha it's still a pretty unique release citizen copes some vocals if I'm gonna throw another critique out there on the track Hades we're also kind of awkward in my opinion the instrumentals while they do set a good dramatic tone and they have a great aesthetic to them I occasionally do wish they had a bit more progression where weren't quite so redundant mostly on the track Oedipus whose horn loop is just really tight and really incessant and pretty loud too in comparison with cos voice almost drowns him out the beats on this thing that worked the best are those that give kah enough room to kind of work with the space around his voice had some interesting overdubs or do some other weird Reaver be vocal experiments that add to the storytelling in the imagery of what he's saying and again even though cos rap style it's pretty one-dimensional it's not very versatile you kind of see what you get and you know what to expect I still love the fuck out of this record I mean the flow of the tracks on this thing is fantastic I like the narrative I like that Greek mythology the lyricism is top tier his delivery is pretty cold-blooded and I do enjoy that the album is pretty tight too as I've stated before it doesn't overstay its welcome I mean not only is this record some of the best material car has dropped in a while but I feel like this album might be an album that I recommend first to people who are new to this guy because it's such a such a fantastic record and why it's fantastic is so obvious on the surface level it hits you with that really cool concept the lyrics are clearly fantastic cause style while it may not be visceral it certainly standout and the production marries so well with what he's doing - I'm feeling a strong a - a light night on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what you I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe

coming up fast and let's just get into it the worst tracks of the week the tracks I thought were the worst tracks of the week number one couch esta is back with a brand new single I'm in the club open parenthesis looking for some love close parentheses featuring joycie singer who I've not heard of before now just hearing of as a result of this CAU single joycie is undoubtedly the best thing about the track kal absolute trash as usual beat sucks it's a desperate song about how he can't get someone to date him or he can't get a girlfriend or some bullshit his rapping sucks he sings on the song - it's terrible it's corny and it's trash and you should feel bad for liking it and listening to it which of course I expect you to do via the link in the description box where we put all the links to all the songs that we talked about in this segment moving on from there Liam Payne has come through with a new single Liam Payne of course of One Direction fame new single features French Montana title of the track is first time it is a really corny horrific pop and rap blend don't ever want to hear it again moving on from there Kyle featuring Wiz Khalifa he delivers one of the most atmospheric hollow buttery and lotion II pop rap singles I have heard in a while absolutely no flavor and personality to this one it is by the numbers and disgusting moving on from there converge has seen fit to release this horrendous care cover of the song disintegration of one of the Bands best tracks and the group does a horrific metalcore version of the song and yeah I mean I guess I guess it speaks to the greatness of converge that this cover is maybe one of the greatest missteps of their entire discography because truth be told in the convergence discography there are many bad songs if any at all and and this is rough cover I'll say that much their attempts at trying to work the songs melody into their typical medical into their usual metal core sound but also trying to bring some more clean vocals in there it's it's just a very odd an awkward hodgepodge though I guess I admire the attempt I admire the ambitious attempt moving on from there save yourself new track from the chainsmokers and nightmare I have no idea what the hell the chainsmokers are doing on this track most of the sounds and electronic dance music cliches Express on this track came and went with the whole dubstep wave and it's like there really is is dubstep so old at this point that we can being a stall joke about it and the chainsmokers can I can kind of bring it back in a way because if that's the case I think that really says a lot about the sad state of culture let's let's get into the tracks I thought we're math did not blow me away but not terribly they're certainly worth mentioning worth pointing out to you guys because you might you might dig them more than me I wouldn't want you to miss some of these cuts moving on from their street sex has a new track out the post-punk industrial noise duo back new album on the way as you guys know they're their last full-length record absolutely loved it one of my favorite albums of that year super abrasive and hard-hitting their follow-up releases like this eep some of the loose non album material they've been dropping since that record has not been quite as harsh and has maybe embraced a more elements of post-punk more clean vocals I was kind of expecting that to be the case for whatever album they would drop going forward because it seemed like the band was maturing and evolving a little bit and getting a bit more dynamic and um while this new track did employ elements of underground rock music that I expected it to I can't say it was all that impressed with how the clean vocals on the cut were executed it just felt a little underwhelming in my opinion but still do check it out and I am open to the song growing on me more as I listen to the entire album and and maybe the whole sound and everything all Grande but the title of the track is in for a world of hurt do give it a shot do give it a shot moving on from there logic has a brand new single app titled the return actually not a bad track super-tight flows from logic flashy lyricism hard-hitting beat you know he does come through with a fun cut every once in a while you know I'll say that unfortunately though logic he's just kind of inconsistent and he does tend to drown in his influences when he is at his worst and employs a lot of the ideas he grabs from them in a really weak and awful way however I don't find that to be the on this new track over here it's just a fun fast lyrical banger moving on from there a new kind of super indie super trio over here featuring Phoebe Bridgers Lucy Dacus and Julian Baker basically the Crosby Stills & Nash of the indie scene right now coming together for a collaborative against super trio new material out we have linked you to one of the songs down there and it's it's not a bad singer-songwriter track with what seems like a good amount of collaborative effort from each member in the trio bite the hand is the name of the song it's a pretty sweet track moving on from there a new track from Joey purp bag talk I think his attitude is energy the instrumental are great but it's just a little OneNote he hits the entire track with this yelling one-dimensional very kind of slow ish and mid-paced flow that I think he really could have switched from at least a few times to make the song more interesting across the whole thing but still I think it brings an OK vibe moving on from there J Mascis sounding as J Mascis as ever on a new solo track new album on the way see you at the movies it's a pretty sweet and somber and melancholy cut in a again typical Mascis fashion that Mascis kind of grungy fuzzy Mascis moody melancholy balladry moving on from there crippled black phoenix new track out thought some of the vocal parts on this track of which there are a few came off a little kooky on this song however maybe with repeated listens it will really grow on me but still that is my biggest critique of the track outside of that the instrumental is actually incredible this is a long expansive heavy and fantastically composed experimental rock track with a lot of power a lot of oomph maybe you'll dig the vocals more than me I definitely implore to you do not out on this track if you're looking for something electrifying in the experimental rock genre moving on from there ash Cuccia has a new track out that I will return zero it is a splashy glitchy plinky kind of colorful piece of IDM that I wish was a bit more interesting structurally but still an aesthetic level it was very pretty and very gratifying to listen to and the good guys over at Armand Hammer have a new track out Billy woods and a lucid the title of the song over here is rehearse with Ornette and yeah it's a pretty grimy underground hip-hop banger with lots of esoteric and cryptic lyrics as you would expect from those guys who have covered on the channel at least a few times before a new record on the way look for it on Bandcamp look for a via backwoods studios next let's get into the best tracks of the week starting off with we have a new collaborative track from Zilla Comi and sus moolah hope I'm pronouncing that name correctly they have a new 3 track collaborative EP out it's okay it's pretty hard hitting it's kind of like trap raps answer to nu metal and this track Trainspotting that I have pointed you guys to is easily one of the grimy ax steadily Astarte on the EP if you like this track you'll most likely love the rest of the EP as its it's all pretty high octane and an explosive moving on from there Haru the Japanese singer-songwriter rapper guitarist who I shouted out earlier this year with a very positive review even she has new music out the title of this new cut I believe is kick in the world and it is just as speedy and passionate and well-structured and intense as many of the tracks off her new album so if you dig on that shit you'll most likely love this new track over here as well moving on from their ybn chord a Scottie Pippen new braggadocious lyrical smart and hard-hitting trap banger really dig in that in a pretty well shot music video to boot that you should not miss out on very fun move not from there these skiffle players a band that has been around for a little bit and is connected to the usually wonderful cast McCombs have a new enchanting and a pretty charming new track out titled local boy which has a very nice I don't know back back wood instrumental feel to it with a lot of character kind of tongue-in-cheek and silly but they they kind of do this quaint folk style a lot of justice which is why I'm putting this track on it's very enjoyable it's very sweet move not from there reboot is the title of this new track over here featuring chance the rapper Joey purp Connie and smoke Oh oh no it is a pretty nice and cutting edge well produced piece of pop wrap with some creative lyrical and vocal input from all parties involved moving on from there joy is the forthcoming record from the UK post-punk and art punk band idols who I have mentioned on the channel numerous times before new track over here titled great seems to be a pointed critique of all of the anti-immigration sentiment bubbling up in the UK currently it's a pretty well put together track catchy and you know good good solid message I guess as well moving on from there hissing is the name of the band here with a new record on the way via prosthetic records I hope I'm not fucking that up but I believe it's prosthetic records that this is coming out from let me just double check on that as I want you guys to know no it's not prosthetic I'm an idiot it's profound lore so scratch that profound lore records Anthony stupid but it's profound lore and this is a pretty black and experimental and somewhat abrasive piece of a death metal over here with some interesting twists and turns a good heavy brutal cavernous production a lot of layers to this thing so you know if you like your death-metal the sort of stray away from the typical meat-and-potatoes sound without getting too technical and wanky and shit I believe you'll end up digging what the band is offering over here moving on from there Empress of has a new track out a brand new single which is pretty sweet the title of the track is when I'm with him and it is a nice piece of pretty synth-heavy very modern contemporary pop but it has a nice quirky left-field edge to it that I think is a pretty cool moving on from there Dodd Strait is the name of this black metal project which I am just now this European black metal project which I am just now becoming aware of aura is the name of this new track and this is a wonderfully animalistic powerful visceral piece of black metal with some amazing passages and and structural I guess details because it's a pretty lengthy track and the man really takes the listener on a ride with this epic this epic cut over here and it's not too atmospheric or washed out or anything like that I would say a great deal of the grandiosity of this song has more to do with the playing and the compositional elements of the track more than it simply can be laid at the feet of oh well they threw a lot of reverb on it you know what I mean while that can sound nice the band plays really well you know the playing on this record is very nice and by record I mean this this song that I'm pointing you to again or is the name of the track don't miss out on this one definitely one of the the better metal tracks that I've heard this month next the good dudes over at Disclosure dropped four different tracks across the past seven days the titles of which are where you came from the extended mix love can be so hard where angels fear to tread and moonlight most of them seem like pretty respectable Dancy driving rhythmic and visceral flips of a variety of different things whether it be like some disco stuff or some 80's synthpop stuff or whether it be like some old old like Dew ops style vocals shit it's all very well put together and in sharp dance music very tasteful - and well produced wanted to shout these tracks out as I think the duo has done very well with all of them and I'm hoping that this is really kind of a forecast for what is to come on this new disclosure record as I did think their last full-length album felt like an attempt at kind of selling their sound short for some commercial short-term commercial success moving on from their digging on this new atmosphere track to want to give a shout out to atmospheres this has been the first cut of his I've enjoyed in a while the title of the song is Virgo and it's a pretty personal and introspective track where he seems to be reflecting on ageing dying the music career that sort of brought him to this point of being a vet in the hip-hop underground and yeah it's just a passionate well-written song with a tasteful instrumental which did put me off at first because I typically am a little wary of the whole acoustic guitar melodrama intro sort of thing but his passion and his lyrical wit did end up winning me over as the song drew on and frankly maybe I'm looking forward to this new atmosphere record more than I have been in atmosphere album in a long time and I'm going to leave it at that guys that has been the weekly track roundup shout out once more to the good people over at sea geek for sponsoring this episode and a lot of other episodes of the weekly track roundup you can find their stuff down there in the description box and our Amazon and turntable lab links down there as well hope you got some good recommendations out of this video I'll see you guys in the next review anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever

Rok6VEyNoFU,hmm hi everyone must they shaved Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Mitsuki album be the cowboy ya know yeaaaah please stop get away little okely-dokely bocalee this is the new breakout album from brooklyn singer and songwriter Mitsuki her fifth full-length LP her latest for dead oceans records this album has been getting rave reviews across the critical spectrum it's been a highly anticipated album to a record that's really given the indie scene something to be excited about as mitsuki's last record puberty 2 was pretty well received and it seemed like be the cowboy was going to be an even more ambitious undertaking now you may also notice that this is my first Mitsuki review that is mostly because while I think her previous material is pretty good it didn't necessarily stop me in my tracks or anything as quite a bit of it felt like pretty boilerplate art pop and in Iraq and alternative rock though Mitsuki would occasionally embellish the meat-and-potatoes aesthetic with some weird lo-fi recordings really noisy thick layers of guitar and some pretty meta lyrics on top of that mitts key is also a very emotionally compelling singer with a deep passionate womanly voice with a lot of volume coming out of that chest in the lower section of the throat something you don't get often enough in a lot of popular music today and something that will most likely make her appeal to fans of like Sharon Van Etten or angel Olson so even though I thought mitts Keys past efforts like puberty to might have been a bit derivative I can't deny that some of her best songs so far in her career were on that record like the heavy emotional and slow burning ballad your best American girl a track that featured a great powerful structure very good lyrics heart-wrenching vocals sorrowful heavy shoegaze iike tars also enjoyed the very fast abrasive and erratic my body is made of crushed little stars going into this new record though I assumed that the improvement Smith scheme a it on puberty too would carry over onto this because the teaser tracks were some of the prettiest I heard this year songs like geyser and to slow dancers sadly be the cowboy doesn't really seem to build on the strengths of MIT skis previous records at all in fact the album seems even farther away from hitting upon a definitive sound or even a unified focus as she stylistically hops from synth pop to disco to all country like she's performing in a musical buffet where she has a bland and surface level take on each genre she serves to the audience with tongs and a sneeze guard the dramatic atmospheres and abrasive and unique aesthetic twist that she would pull off on her last record seemed to have been swapped out entirely on this new album for instrumentation that sounds maybe a little bit more mature but on the whole it's pretty safe and risk-free and another thing be the cowboy could have used are some more fleshed out song structures and satisfying song lengths as this album is 30 minutes long about the same length as her previous efforts but be the cowboy features more tracks so you have the same runtime being spread out amongst more songs which is odd because an album of this style and with this many tracks could have easily been 40 minutes and great but instead MIT's key neuters multiple tracks on this thing with abrupt and super brief endings or weaving some of these tracks into odd musical detours that bring them to awkward finishes I mean it's no surprise given the material that she had on her last couple of records that the most emotionally compelling song and this thing is the longest again the song to slow dancers and generally it's not even really that long of a track it's kind of just a normal song length it's the tracks on this thing that are one and two minutes long that are kind of underwhelming and lack impact and Mitsuki is no stranger to short songs for previous records feature them but at least on past efforts she would come through with some kind of direct bold memorable idea that would make this brief moment in time have an impression not the case on be the cowboy as some of the shortest songs on here number as a few of the most unoriginal half-baked and tedious tracks I've heard in 2018 the song blue light with its weird alt-country intro which eventually collides into this ambient scat fest Mitsuki literally kind of scatting in a very somber fashion over this watery atmospheric hollow instrumental the song come into the water which is a very moody and monie motif that makes some of Lana Del Rey's worst songs sound mature and finished and the song lonesome loved to even with the song sexually raw and intimate lyrics the track doesn't really overcome it's boring alt-country milquetoast instrumental the only short song on this album that really won me over and left an impact had to be the song old friend though which features some very gentle pianos and acoustic guitars but I think the real magic of the song comes through in mitsuki's voice the incredibly sentimental lyrics and the odd way that the instrumental grooves the pianos the guitars the drums the mitts keys vocals - they feel almost offset from one another in a very alluring and confusing yet hypnotic way these slightly more formal songs in the tracklist here are more appealing but not by much the song why didn't you stop me which sounds kind of like a stale piece of synth infused indie rock from the 2000s that could have dropped in 2003 and would have been completely old hat by 2005 even with its illustrious horn finish the song nobody sounds like an awkward attempt at a Morrissey croon over a lackluster indie disco instrumental mitsuki's vocals and lyrics once again are pretty impressive but the instrumental leaves a lot to be desired and kind of reminds me of Belle and Sebastian's recent attempts at going dance when mitts key does manage to overcome the weak pastiche of dated Indian alt-rock over the past 10 to 20 years it's typically because of her voice and her lyricism the song remember my name has a pretty bold intro with this sun-scorched guitar that sounds like something off of an old White Stripes record or maybe it's not a guitar I can't really tell at this point it's so distorted it's it's almost unidentifiable either way what's truly appealing on the track is mitts keys lyrical meditation here on Fame performance and self-perception singing about giving her heart when performing and needing to get someone who loves her nose her understands hers that she can get that love and sort of let it out there at the next show the next performance lyrically I think she paints an important and vivid picture of the feelings that a performer might feel and the void left that people paying attention to you because they like your music or they think you're a cool actor or they find you sexy it's it's just kind of hollow and fleeting it doesn't really fill you up doesn't really bring anything of substance to your life damn its key I'm equally moved by the lyrics that she pens on the song of pearl where it seems like the pressure and agony of a failed relationship at least that's how the song reads has created this image or rather this pearl in her mind that she kind of rolls around glows she stares at it she's hypnotized by it she can't seem to look away she also speaks about falling in love with this relationship or the state of it and refers to that as a war the song me and my husband is a very jaunty piece of piano rock that sounds like it could have been on the first couple of Ben Folds five records lyrically it's very much about the rough and the smooth of her married experience and kind of sticking with that through the lows it's an admirable and beautiful song and again mitsuki's voice really kind of makes it the song washing-machine heart is a bustling and fast piece of very sinister synth pop and again another major highlight for me is to slow dancers the last in the longest song on the album and why it has one of the simplest instrumentals here with some very cool watery keyboards and occasional rushes of strings and of course mitts keys voice you could argue it's one of the plainest instrumentals here but the beautiful pacing of the song the slow burn of the song and mitts keys vocals the way it kind of builds up emotionally is just so gorgeous and beautiful and in leaves and impression you can really sit with the song and stew in its emotion whereas so many songs prior to this one don't allow you to do so by the time you've kind of gotten head or tails of what the track is exactly about it's just gone and again granted some albums pull that off pretty well but I don't think this one does a lot of the time I find this record to be kind of pleasant but also sort of plain at its best its enthralling its heart-wrenching it is emotionally captivating and at its worst it feels aggravated ly rushed and like a breeze that is so faint you can't even feel it granted I haven't been a huge fan of mitsuki's work up until this point but I would easily take her past two albums over be the cowboy especially puberty too sure in some respects you could argue that be the cowboy is her most mature album yet but for some reason this album is severely lacking in ways that her previous records weren't and it's kind of sad to see the best qualities of bury me at makeout Creek and puberty to fail to carry over onto this richer and more dynamic sound I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the

Rok6VEyNoFU,hmm hi everyone must they shaved Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Mitsuki album be the cowboy ya know yeaaaah please stop get away little okely-dokely bocalee this is the new breakout album from brooklyn singer and songwriter Mitsuki her fifth full-length LP her latest for dead oceans records this album has been getting rave reviews across the critical spectrum it's been a highly anticipated album to a record that's really given the indie scene something to be excited about as mitsuki's last record puberty 2 was pretty well received and it seemed like be the cowboy was going to be an even more ambitious undertaking now you may also notice that this is my first Mitsuki review that is mostly because while I think her previous material is pretty good it didn't necessarily stop me in my tracks or anything as quite a bit of it felt like pretty boilerplate art pop and in Iraq and alternative rock though Mitsuki would occasionally embellish the meat-and-potatoes aesthetic with some weird lo-fi recordings really noisy thick layers of guitar and some pretty meta lyrics on top of that mitts key is also a very emotionally compelling singer with a deep passionate womanly voice with a lot of volume coming out of that chest in the lower section of the throat something you don't get often enough in a lot of popular music today and something that will most likely make her appeal to fans of like Sharon Van Etten or angel Olson so even though I thought mitts Keys past efforts like puberty to might have been a bit derivative I can't deny that some of her best songs so far in her career were on that record like the heavy emotional and slow burning ballad your best American girl a track that featured a great powerful structure very good lyrics heart-wrenching vocals sorrowful heavy shoegaze iike tars also enjoyed the very fast abrasive and erratic my body is made of crushed little stars going into this new record though I assumed that the improvement Smith scheme a it on puberty too would carry over onto this because the teaser tracks were some of the prettiest I heard this year songs like geyser and to slow dancers sadly be the cowboy doesn't really seem to build on the strengths of MIT skis previous records at all in fact the album seems even farther away from hitting upon a definitive sound or even a unified focus as she stylistically hops from synth pop to disco to all country like she's performing in a musical buffet where she has a bland and surface level take on each genre she serves to the audience with tongs and a sneeze guard the dramatic atmospheres and abrasive and unique aesthetic twist that she would pull off on her last record seemed to have been swapped out entirely on this new album for instrumentation that sounds maybe a little bit more mature but on the whole it's pretty safe and risk-free and another thing be the cowboy could have used are some more fleshed out song structures and satisfying song lengths as this album is 30 minutes long about the same length as her previous efforts but be the cowboy features more tracks so you have the same runtime being spread out amongst more songs which is odd because an album of this style and with this many tracks could have easily been 40 minutes and great but instead MIT's key neuters multiple tracks on this thing with abrupt and super brief endings or weaving some of these tracks into odd musical detours that bring them to awkward finishes I mean it's no surprise given the material that

7Z65GoMcY04,okay hi everyone it's three itno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new young thug album or compilation I guess slime language what are you doing I'm speaking that slime language okay in conjunction with stoner life records this is the latest commercial album from trapped Trailblazer young thug the chances of thugger going completely quiet without a brand new commercial record in 2018 were pretty slim but slime language still felt like a relative surprise with its kind of sudden release it stirred a lot of excitement and for good reason young thug has been on a bit of an adventurous streak lately with projects like his partially acoustic and guitar driven beautiful thugger girls also his banger filled EP with carnage young martha also his collaborative mixtape with future but slime language goes back instead to the predictable and vocally dynamic track balladry of previous projects like slime season 1 2 & 3 which is still a relatively strong hand for thugger to play because even after several years of inspiring countless copycats and expanding the vocal landscape of auto crooning young thug still sounds one-of-a-kind he still sticks out he still sounds like a freak of nature and on this new project he seems oddly comfortable with inviting lesser rappers on to his songs who are obviously following in his footsteps and carry way less weight vocally and just kind of sound like boring biters talking about guys like duke who sounds like he could be an auxiliary member of the migos also gonna i've commented on his vocal likeness to young thug before and him and duke are even featured on young thug's YSL label imprint so I guess that's partially a reason why he's motivated to feature both of them so prominently on this project but typically both of their features across this record are really unnecessary and they usually way whatever track that they're on down jacques however I thought the goofiest appearance on the entire project and another completely unspectacular voice on this record has to be little baby whose continued popularity just boggles my mind as he is maybe one of the most nondescript rappers out there right now I can't even recall anything that he did on that quality control tape and I reviewed the goddamn thing there are a few newer voices on slime language that do steal the show like Carly who is actually a young thug's girlfriend she kills the hook on the track you mean slime enough these big juicy stamina she has a really expressive voice a super sticky refrain of course her voice is slathered in auto-tune and little kids very expressive and boyish and maybe overly emotional voice on the hook to the song going up goes over really well too I'm also super surprised to hear thugger sisters on this record as well under the names hi Dora and dolly who both kind of steal the show on one of the final tracks of the project there are some pretty good and familiar things going on with some of the songs on this project young thug's yell pee and bird-like vocals bang out some really sharp and sticky hooks on a handful of cuts like on dirty shoes and chanel and January 1st or a January the best the beats generally on this project are kind of smooth and glamorous and a little atmospheric very pretty but I find a lot of the beats on this thing to be kind of nondescript I mean they're definitely instrumentals that young thug sounds good over and and instrumentals that I think typically would be found on a young thug project but that doesn't help the fact that they still sound pretty basic and formulaic and overall slime language it's it's pretty one-dimensional and loaded with filler like with some of his least interesting projects a lot of thugger localizations just feel really off-the-cuff kind of effortless - there are also very few lyrical quotables to speak of across this record unfortunately thugger just does not take as many instrumental and vocal risks on this record as he has in the past especially when compared to a record like jeffery and even when he does do something a little unorthodox with his voice it's not necessarily to the benefit of the song like on the song oh yeah where his voice is slathered in these really obnoxious auto-tuned effects I mean there's quite a bit of auto-tune on this record but I don't know what it is about this one particular song where the auto-tune is particularly grating then there's also the song Audemars where he kicks off the track and also repeats this voice a few different times across the song where he's he's kind of just like squawking like a bird I know I likened his voice to a bird earlier on the record but he's literally doing like this and it's it's something on the 15 tracks of this record there is very little here that is legitimately exciting memorable worth revisiting yet another quantity over quality project from thugger I guess I just thank God that it's under an hour in length but still the number of projects Jeffery has of this style are stacking up I still do appreciate his one-of-a-kind voice and delivery but yet again I don't think it is enough to carry an entire album there needs to be some kind of songwriting substance there and yet there just continues to to not be but young thug's seems to be doing fine doing things as he's doing them so but however it would be nice to hear thugger drop another project where he's not just falling back on predictable production and low effort vocal riffing for 2 or 3 minutes at a time not to mention filling out a run of these songs with totally boring generic and uninteresting guests who don't really bring much to the table vocally or lyrically unfortunately despite the fact that thugger is one of the most unique and innovative voices in this auto crooner trap ballad filled this is a painfully average record in this particular style which in a weird way I think says a lot about the state of this trend I'm feeling a strong 4 to like 5 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana young thug forever 
bhRXWcgHckI,oh hi everyone breathe any of you tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another edition of the white you know review where I come on here and I review a bunch of albums that I didn't review I go through a gauntlet of them for you that is the concept of the why you know review you should know at this point because I've done them so many times so yeah gauntlet style short brief takes on a series of Records I did not do full-length reviews of let's do it a bob am I've been kind of plotting on this compilation for a while now as I've seen quite a few rave reviews of it online and it is a pretty eclectic mix of artists on this up-and-coming label who are very much in a very low phi experimental bedroom pop style and there's a really interesting and creative tracks on here I'll get it that if you really love those genres of music give this thing a shot do not miss it however there are a lot of songs on here there is a lot of material there are a lot of different artists on here as well so with that comes lots of variation in personality and song quality too especially as quite a few tracks on here are pretty rough or just incredibly nondescript and generic for these lo-fi and bedroom pop genres so do keep that in mind but again if you're crazy about the styles of music give this thing a shot I have to give to Priscilla on this one there's some great some legitimately great country songs on this thing her voice is fantastic production is really tasteful there are some moments where I think the sound and the style of the album go off the rails a little bit where she is doing kind of a reggae thing and it's just okay there are also some tracks on here legit country tracks where some like trap drums pop up in the background which miraculously it's actually better than Justin Timberlake's recent half-ass attempts at trying to blend pop with trap and hip hop so while it's not as consistent and as deeply country as I would like to be there are some fantastic moments on this record and Priscilla is certainly a country artist who I think is worth looking out for in the future [Music] yeah I've I've never heard a panic at the disco album I liked I've never really been a fan of the band I don't think it's gonna start now I just think I missed that train you know I missed it I I can't get on the boat now you know I'm I'm just too far gone take me out behind the shed and just put me out of my misery you know that's that's all I can say despite my enjoyment of stoner metal and doom metal generally and the consistently positive reviews that that job seemed to garner with each record and they do seem to be a very consistent band I just could not find a whole lot that I find interesting about their stuff I do appreciate that they try to throw some more interesting chord progressions into their music that they try to take their songs on these long and massive and epic like 10 plus minute journeys and some of the soaring vocals worked into these tracks are kind of passionate almost like something you would hear in a power metal song I do hear some defining characteristics that separate them from other bands in their genre I wouldn't necessarily call them meat and potatoes but I again I guess I just have a hard time really getting into their stuff and and seeing what is so fantastic about it I it's something I just can't quite put my finger on and unfortunately there are some groups there are some albums there are some records that are like that for me I'm not really crazy about it I don't really dislike it either but I can't really again put a finger on what exactly about it is preventing me from really kind of coming through with a definitively positive or negative opinion of the music that's all I can say [Music] next Santi gold has a new mixtape out which is a pretty nice fun quirky raw little dancehall album the production and the vocals are pretty predictable and one-dimensional across the entire album but the record is still very much a fun listen I guess just don't go into this thing looking for the epic or the finely groomed potentially mainstream experience of her past couple of albums it's just a low-key fun [Music] part of me was pretty excited to hear Milo and a lucid of Armand Hammer Fame team up for this pretty shortened to the point collaborative effort it's like 28 minutes or so and it's obviously a very abstract hip hop outing I think there are some cool flows here there are some funny turns of phrase there's some smart lyricism to some great and creative instrumentals and sampling there's even a track I'm sampled on but for the most part I just didn't really get a whole lot of chemistry between these two guys like hearing them both each do their thing on a track didn't really do much for me as it just kind of seemed like both of them were in their own little separate esoteric worlds just trying to be as difficult to read as possible I mean I'm not going to knock it it's a decent release it's maybe one of the better abstract underground gems that you'll hear in the hip hop world this year but for the most part the vibe of this album having these two very unique rappers appear on one track after another it just felt more casual than it did collaborative [Music] new Neko Case album I was kind of highly anticipating this record after I enjoyed some of the lead singles to it but for the most part I found the album experience to be a little drawn out and underwhelming this record is nowhere near as sharp and as I guess twangy as a lot of the very punchy and fantastic alt-country records that she has dropped up until this point this album is much more atmospheric and contemplative and introspective case has had a pretty long career up into this point she's given herself a lot to reflect on on this album longtime fans will most likely get a lot out of that but there were a lot of moments on this record that I found to be a little bit of a slog and that's all [Music] Carla's new record over here was one that I was highly anticipating because her last full-length record boy I gave a very positive review to and yeah this record certainly fits the bill of its title in that it is very quiet it is very droney it is very spacious and ambient but the drones just don't really have much body in my opinion plus this record also lacks Carla's fantastic voice which I mean some of it is on here but not to the degree of which it is on her previous records and her voice is really one of the more unique characteristics of her music yeah I just found the sound escapes on this record to be very bland I found the progressions of these songs to be very underwhelming I didn't think the pretty interesting guess listed as being featured in the tracklist here really brought all that much to the record either it just really felt like a somewhat experimental and abstract snoozer [Music] tony molina new album over here a slightly cleaner and a more mature sequel to his very smart fun and 11 minute lo-fi concept album dissed and dismissed may be the shortest breakup album ever recorded I really love the loaf aesthetic of that LP I love the the kind of rough rock sound of that album this new record over here is much more cleanly recorded though the songs are still relatively short um I don't know I I just feel like in this attempt to make his sound in style a bit more mature a bit more palatable a bit cleaner Tony has lost a lot of the original appeal of his songwriting and aesthetic I mean that's my opinion on top of it a lot of the bass elements of his music the songwriting the themes that go into his songs haven't really changed all that much at all which kind of leaves these weird aesthetic shifts feeling like just mere window dressing in a way I feel like I'm listening to a squeaky-clean watered-down and more regulated version of the album that I enjoyed just a few years ago elza's new album over here is easily going to be one of the most dark and experimental Latin albums you listen to this year if you give it a shot she made a bit of a comeback with this more experimental sound recently and I've kind of liked the direction I respect it I think it's interesting though I do think her vocals at this point in her career are a little lacking and just leave a lot to be desired at this age that she's at they do feel a bit rusty however I think for a lot of longtime fans that's most likely the appeal maybe if her music was something that I grew up with and was kind of a part of my life as I was growing maybe this record would have more impact on me but it just doesn't however I can certainly see and respect the risks that she's taking on this record on her previous record and I want to give a nod to that and I want to point this album out to anybody who is into Latin music and might be interested in trying an album like this you know give it a shot have an open mind you might like the vocals more than me there are certainly enough album reviews that I've done over the years where the vocals do nothing for me but they do a lot for a lot of other people so dance Gavin dance easily one of the most infamous reviews on my channel is a dance Gavin dance review and for good reason because it was pretty negative however I got a give a nod to this record I got to give some respect to this record I got to put some respect on this records name because I do think dance Gavin dance do their best to actually write some straightforward and cogent songs with tasteful instrumentals on this LP the songs on this record are a pretty cool blend of screamo and you know just like some straightforward emo pop or pop rock the playing isn't as needlessly flashy or noodley or obnoxious or annoying as it's been on recent releases and that's a great thing though I don't really care for a lot of the vocal styles featured on this record especially the very high and nasally cleans delivered on a lot of songs I can see that dance Gavin dance have made some great changes and great alterations they're sound and they are evolving and yeah I think this is certainly an improvement even if this sound in this style again isn't even really for me new bong Ripper album over here certainly heavier and I think more sinister and menacing than their last album which is a good thing which I thought was a little underwhelming on the sound side of things but still the band's recording they're writing the guitar tone the lengthy and gargantuan two tracks of this album that accumulate for all of the runtime it all sounds pretty mean potatoes I mean it's it's nasty it's caked in distortion it's very heavy and aggressive stoner doom but I just find a lot of the riffs to be a little generic again the drumming to be okay it's just all right it's I it's okay it's okay new Ryan Beattie album over here been getting a lot of requests to cover this one as Ryan has collaborated with Brock Hampton on a couple occasions and yeah I think this new record of his is okay if you're into the whole you know new neo-soul white boy soul you know bedroom pop kind of vibe I think Bryan brings a lot of good songs to the table vocally and instrumentally I think the record is so so it's not really blowing me away or anything like that but there are some sweet tunes on here oh I'll give the record that so if you're a huge Frank ocean guy or an alternative R&B guy or like Rex Orange County guy or something like that I think this record will appeal to you give it a shot it's nice on the ears its pleasant it's just not very standout in my opinion sectioned UK metalcore outfit over here connected to another metalcore band with a super bombastic sound Bob Bassett to the point where the the albums that they make are just mind melting the band front error section is is maybe only slightly less aggressive and slightly more intelligible in terms of the the mix the vocals the guitar riffs the drumming but still that this record is really a fucking punishment like it is it is so relentlessly aggressive that it just beats the shit out of your eardrums with a sledgehammer all the songs are really dizzying to the point where they all really buzz by without much in the way of any defining characteristics it's nearly annoys album in just how abrasive it is in some respects but but still has a kind of one-dimensional production style and tone across the entire thing whereas I think a noise record would be a bit more creative with the sounds that it presents yeah for metalcore for a mathcore album it's okay it's decent I just feel like the band didn't really do enough to just add enough just interesting sounds or compositional elements to these tracks to sweeten the deal bring a bit more memorability add some kind of defining characteristics to them because truth be told a lot of these tracks just blend together for me no matter how many times I revisited this album and tried to gain more of a familiarity with it I've been sitting on this Natalie press album for a while just trying to make it click and trying to make it appeal to me and while I do think this record is an improvement over her last album in that it's not quite the very airy and middle-of-the-road chamber pop experience that their debut was there's a bit more of a backing beat to this thing it's a bit funkier that groovy or a bit more sensual but as a vocalist and a songwriter I still find Natalie's songs to be just okay I think she brings a lot of very tasteful instrumental additions to this record and for the most part the songs sound very pleasant and are pretty sweet on the ears but they just don't stick out to me they don't stick out unfortunately as much as I again wanted them to and I've been revisiting this album for weeks now waiting for that moment where it's like whoa that's really what is special about the album but unfortunately it's just it just hasn't happened [Music] new Amin a mix tape and it's okay it's decent it's more of a vibe than anything the the whole feel of the tape is pretty much like the front cover you're sort of chilling in the car you're maybe hi and just kind of just not wanting a whole lot to go on so the instrumentals and the tracks on this thing are pretty chill they're pretty short he's kind of riffing a lot vocally seems like maybe even lyrically too on occasion you know he's just kind of throwing stuff out there and seeing what sticks not a whole lot of structure or building out not a lot of sharp pieces of word play or rhymes on here either it's just a very chill very surface level very wavy tape I don't know exactly how one writes a super safe predictable and completely

turntable lab link you buy some speakers a turntable some records we get kick back from it supports the show supports the channel supports the segment and let's get into the traction so I thought were the worst ones this week let's do it quite a few worst tracks this week honestly first off it's the new 1975 track to time to time to time which is a huge contrast from their last cut which had a pretty nice organic instrumental at least a little bit more than usual from them some good vocals and some thoughtful I guess socially charged lyrics this new cut over here though is a total mess instrumental is obnoxious overly produced super sanitary vocals are slathered in in so much auto-tune they sound horrendous and it just sounds like a crappy Vampire Weekend song yeah can't can't stand it moving on from there the new SOB RBE track vibes which is anything but a vibe it's a little obnoxious that the group essentially approaches songs with pretty much the same flow every time I'm kind of that they break things up a bit more going forward because this is just preposterous how their recent material is just so painfully formulaic that you know exactly what you're going to hear when you're going to hear it on their newer material like let's try to break it up a little bit especially since there are multiple members of the group you know certainly there's there's room for alteration but yeah definitely definitely one of their more uninspired and formulaic tracks today I still do like kind of their raw and very youthful attitude and their wild energy but again kind of approaching most tracks with the same delivery is a little tiresome moving on from their chance the rapper is the featured artist on the new Racine M track what's the hook and yeah there's not that strong of a hook or an instrumental the rapping is pretty subpar on this track too it just sounds like a very off-the-cuff annoying mess didn't really care for it honestly moving on from there Paul McCartney comes out with one of his worst singles in years essentially trying to pen a very bad over-the-top generic Millennial ballad on this one complete with though you know the soaring whoa type vocals that's awful and the faux you whine is vomit inducing so let's let's leave it at that Calvin Harrison Sam Smith essentially come together with one of the most generic throwback pop house songs have heard in a while that essentially serves as a reminder of why this sound like died out in the 90s and the super early 2000s and why it doesn't need to come back I'm just kind of flabbergasted as to how an artist like Calvin Harris who clearly has a very high level of talent can be this inconsistent quality-wise and let's move on to the tracks that was kind of man not not blown away by them but certainly worth mentioning the lemon twigs are back with a song titled the fire I feel like the the melodrama and the narrative of the song kind of gets away from them a little bit and the toons suffers as a result of it but still a kind of fun track if you enjoy your old-school nostalgic kind of throwback rock music to have a somewhat theatrical tone I guess the field is back with a new minimal techno track which is pretty hypnotic and pretty cool who goes there as the title of the track new record on the way be on the lookout for that next we have a brand new song from Russ titled the flute song and yeah it sounds pretty much as average as every other Russ song new record on the way I guess super average flows plane instrumental dragging his ass off about his supposed I guess that being generic dime-a-dozen rapper with out many specific musical characteristics that I could draw directly to him but I don't know his music just sounds really plain to me and that just continues to be the case moving on from there rena saw a Yamaha brand new single sounds a lot like the electro-pop and dance-pop of the 2000s like a lot of her material does but I felt like instrumentally and structurally this new track over here was a little safer Reena felt kind of plain and like she was I don't know just kind of embodying very modern playing mainstream pop rather than reinventing it or approaching it with any kind of flair or very sharp snappy songwriting moving on from there me without you new track out new EP out new album on the way the song over here is titled Julia or holy to the Lord on the bells of horses not as lyrically intensive vocally impassioned as I enjoy my meat without you songs to be instrumentally just kind of felt like a nice easygoing blend of indie rock an alternative rock it was okay I guess I was just hoping for a stronger vocal performance but the vocals are kind of doubled up and soaked in all these effects they feel very warped and very subdued and aren't very intriguing to me honestly hopefully this is not indicative of the sound on the entire album because for a teaser track there's a little under a little underwhelming moving on from there Lowe has a new track out titled disarray much like these songs they have released from this upcoming album there is kind of an experimental and ambient edge to this new cut over here very eerie very Spacey very quiet I will say though this new cut over here the persistent abrasive rhythmic prickly sounds coming out of this track which if you can listen to it you'll you'll know exactly what I'm talking about I thought they would just kind of be an intro thing or a tone setter and the band would eventually grow past it but no instead they kind of last throughout the entire track and they really kind of bog the song down and are only interesting for so long I guess I feel like it's a bit overdone and really kind of kills the quality of the song overall and finally fucked up the Canadian punk rock band new song out normal people it's a bit of a nice change of pace for the group as the song features a lot of these kind of dramatic and somewhat dime-a-dozen but again nice change of pace poke post-punk passages that aren't at all like the usual roaring overwrought punk rock that you typically got a fucked up record though they do transition into some moments like that and it's a good dynamic it's a good switch can't say I'm crazy about the song or the way either of those different passages sound but structurally and dynamically I think it's a good change of pace for the band and let's get into the tracks I thought we're best the ones that really kind of hit me blew me away first Rosalia with pienso and Tamira which is a single that came out a little while ago I missed it this is the second single I believe that has dropped from this forthcoming release of hers and she continues to fuse elements of modern pop with flamenco and it sounds amazing it sounds awesome I think this tune is actually stronger than the last tune that she dropped mellow meant a just great singing super amazing percussion and instrumental on this one it's very mystical it's very sexy it's very impassioned melodically it's amazing and Rosalia vocally always impresses so loving what she's doing just continuing to love it moving on from there I'll land Oh chill with a new track out with quail a Chris songs titled peso killer underground abstract hip hop track with some great vocal performances from both these guys a lot of character on this song and some smart bars too so do not miss out on this track next moving on from there Kurt Vile has a new fantastic piece of folk rock out titled loading zones definitely one of my favorite vile songs in a while so again don't miss out on this one because I feel like Kurt could kind of be bouncing back on this record a little bit because his last one truth be told was was kind of weak moving on from there Joyce Manor think I'm still in love with you is a pretty good fusion of pop rock all rock and emo just great quality guitars great hooks great melody good lead vocals just again quality songwriting quality songwriting that's what I think a lot of these underground emo tinged rock bands need right now and certainly Joyce Maynard does bring it to the table moving on from there gorillas toss green apple this new set of songs that has been teasing toward a new record like with every gorilla toss record so far just sounds totally different totally reinvented this time around it's not so much the spunky and super colorful and funky sounds of post-punk and freaky 80s pop rock as much as this new set of songs feels like a freaky psychedelic experimental electronic weirdo experiment and really it's it's kind of indescribable in a way with some very strange almost spoken word type vocals on top of it it wasn't too crazy about the last track but this new one green apple I dug so much more I guess I'm just continuing to enjoy and appreciate the versatility of the band while I may not enjoy every direction that they take things and it's it's always interesting and cool to hear them challenge themselves and push into a new direction moving out from there fiddler who I haven't really enjoyed a song from in a while a new track out titled are you high stylistically it may kind of feel like generic nineties alt-rock or maybe even a little watered down post grunge from the early 2000s but the track has a hilarious attitude has a bit of a kind of a fuck you I'm gonna do what I want with my body and my bad decisions type of message to it which I can't really a you know complain too much about and I just kind of like the the raw personality of the track and the finger double finger in the air attitude quite a bit and the hook is super strong so respect to respect to fiddler on this new cut over here DJ Muggs and doom have come out with a another single and new track from the forthcoming bugs project this one over here titled assassination day much darker in earlier and more morbid than the last collaborative track that they dropped actually comes with a visual too of like the president getting assassinated but the president is depicted as being Kanye West it's it's a very odd visual but it's a super dark and crazy song and and easily one of the most refreshing performances that Doom has given in a long time it seems like mugs is really kind of putting doom outside of his comfort zone and sort of getting him to perform outside of the typical gear that I think he has caught himself in as a result of just you know being a veteran at this point who people expect a certain thing from and now it seems like he's just trying to break it up a little bit and and I like that collaborating with mugs is allowing him to do that next I'm diggin on this new track over here from Cloud Nothings echo of the world is the title of the new track new album on the way if you remember I was kind of underwhelmed by the I guess softer approach that Cloud Nothings were taking with their last record this new album over here seems to kind of bring back that sound of experimental and underground alternative rock from 90s with some very strange guitar passages and production choices that I thought were really really cool and kind of cutting edge excuse me holy fuck I'm disgusting I'm moving on from there Cat Power has a new track out woman featuring Lana Del Rey which actually goes over much better than I anticipated that it would maybe the hook on this track comes off a little awkward with the woman like it's it's very persistent and repetitive I guess but still I thought their vocals married very well and the instrumental is really quality and has good pacing to it the track that is yeah just overall good song and it's cool to hear Cat Power returning with a cool risk over here with the guest and just a good tune overall so and Boston osh the experimental black metal group from America is back with a super animalistic performance and sharp song on the track my shroud does take a little bit to get going with a somewhat dreary guitar instrumental at the her passage rather at the front end of the cup once it gets going it goes it goes it goes and it goes and I will leave it at that everyone that has been the weekly track roundup of

nFM1sCBx9do,hi everyone wreathen ELAC Stano here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the two new igloo ghosts eps steal Mogu and clear timmy like I said these are two brand new EPS of music from UK producer and total wizkid igloo ghosts following up his electrifying debut full-length album neo wax bloom in 2017 a record that was an inventive and colorful blend of wonky bubblegum bass glitch music IDM and more while you shouldn't directly label igloo ghost music as drum and bass or jungle or breakbeat or anything like that his music is still very much in the vein of the incredibly fast and jittery electronic music that the UK has been exporting for decades but now it's being upgraded and renovated for a new generation of listeners with insanely complex rhythms neon synthesizers and a whole boatload of conceptual lore which these EPS add to there are quite a few words I would use to describe a glucose music psychedelic ADHD futuristic dizzying mesmerizing and clear Tammy and steel Mogu are all of that and more while also I guess being kind of character portraits for the to igloo ghost figures that are featured on the front of these covers or at least I presume that their igloo ghosts this right here is an igloo ghost apparently these are eyes floating around the igloo ghost and they morph into witches this is what a witch looks like then the witches Morphin igloo ghosts but then also in the igloo ghost universe are these weird worms figures which you can also see depicted on the front of the Chinese New Year EP apparently this is what happens when you see some sort of mutation between a witch and an igloo ghost evolution this will all be on the test so I hope you're writing this down okay you're gonna get it it's not that hard it's not that difficult igloo ghosts the producer that is can even be seen interacting with these figures mostly the clear teme in the music video for the title track of this EP with both of them having like a weird wrapped exchange in a totally made-up language it all sounds very odd and it very much is and it's partially why a glucose continues to be such an interesting figure now with these two separate EPS you kind of get two separate sounds and tones aesthetically speaking I think clear teme is a bit brighter shinier sweeter melodically quite a bit of the material on this thing features vocal work all of the songs flow together pretty seamlessly to steal Mogu by comparison is a few minutes shorter I think the bass is more aggressive and heavy on this one the vibe of this EP is a bit darker and these songs feel a bit more defined and separate from one another too now keep in mind there's more musical common ground between these two EPs than there isn't in fact a lot of what's here is pretty much in the same stylistic wheelhouse as a lot of the material off a glucose last album some of the tracks here might have even been sitting around for a while who knows so while in a lot of respects the material on these EP sounds like typical igloo ghost he does add some really smart transitions some cool details into these beats and some refreshing instrumental additions to so he certainly does work to keep things interesting and prevent his sound from staling out not that his sound is really easy to get sick of anyway or wrap your head around because igloo ghost once again is bringing dizzying beats these relentless shifts and transitions otherworldly synth patches to the overall package just sounds like it's from another dimension the song new vectors is a wonderful track off of clear Timmy these beautiful texture rich beats playing nicely against the glassy synthesizers all over this track there's also a lot of very nice touches of string work on this song too that's actually pretty gorgeous and brings the song a nice organic flavor there's also a lot of very odd high-pitched singing throughout this track - this sounds like it's been manipulated a little bit in a way it has a bit of an operatic tone to it and this is not the only moment on these 2 EPS where vocals in this style pop up so while this track may be really in your face and hard-hitting there are a lot of very beautiful musical passages on it - between the strings and the vocals that as a listener make me feel like I'm I'm floating on air the EPS title track I thought was a little under well at first because the slow rapping in a totally made-up language felt kind of underwhelming mostly because it's so monotone however I did come to appreciate the songs patient progression the dramatic percussion the response wraps in a higher pitched voice and some of the insane overwhelming beats and musical layers that pop up in the middle and the end of the cut nama is not a bad moment on the EP though I did find it to be one of the more aesthetically and musically typical moments on the record something that really would have fits snugly into really any part of the tracklist of neo wax bloom and it would have sounded right at home and the whole thing finishes off with the incredibly eerie and beautiful shrine hacker the track is almost eight minutes long it prominently features these very breathy high-pitched vocals from somebody by the name of babby what igloo was trying to do here somewhat reminds me of very underwhelming vocal spots like infinite mint off of his last album except unclear Timmy over here it is pulled off better because the singing really does sound like it's coming from one of these weird characters in the igloo ghost universe also of course on this track are very punchy beats and squiggly synth tones these strings from previous moments return to lots of fidgety rhythms as well the structure overall of this track is very dynamic and the ending of the song is very lavish to steal Mogu is almost as enjoyable as clear timmy it's a bit more straightforward it's not as seamless a listening experience it's not as flowery or as densely layered or at least it doesn't sound like it is it's more in-your-face it's got more bangers though I will say some elements of clear Timmy do return on this EP like these soaring beautiful operatic vocals that popped up here and there igloo also makes room for them on the track black light ultra really the best song on the EP most cutting edge most tightly produced the track also features these very speedy chipmunk vocals that sort of fade in and out of focus and the mix I wonder if they're representative of this character on the cover in some way and even though igloo ghost music is deeply electronic by design I feel like steel Mogu is a bit more synthetic and digital in comparison in addition to sounding slightly more nocturnal I'm highly impressed with the song main mode as well one of these a knee and most head-spinning bangers of 2018 it sounds like dubstep trying to do calculus while zooming through a rip in the space-time continuum igloo ghost also delivers tracks on this EP that feel pretty typical for him again could have landed on neo wax bloom and it would have sounded very uniform with everything else the title track on hear the song Knight racer as well that being said though even predictable igloo ghost is pretty fun as listening tonight racer feels like I'm racing at hyperspeed along an asteroid belt with its propulsive beats and it's weird stretching percussive sounds works like it's versatile progression to the way the song feels is so incredibly round and rubbery it's like I'm kind of building up and up and up like a roller coaster and then quickly falling down overall I thought these EPS were very entertaining loved one thought the other one was very good too while igloo ghost didn't show an incredible amount of progression on both of these records overall I kind of look at it as like maybe a transitional moment or if we were to look at igloo ghosts as like a piece of software or something neo acts bloom could be igloo ghosts 1.0 I very much feel like these two EPs it's like igloo ghost 1.5 and the next record I'm hoping will kind of be that that next version that continues to deepen the sound and deepen the lore that surrounds this project - it's great to hear igloo ghosts pulling off tracks with a bit more harmonious depth a bit more melody a bit more percussive detail and if you've enjoyed what he's done up until this point or if you're just generally a fan of inventive and very hyper electronic music give this thing a shot don't miss out on it I'm feeling a decent eight on clear teme and I'm feeling a decent seven on steel Mogu transition have you given these EPS a listen did you love them did you hate them what would you rate them you're the best you're the best watch a tire view next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if the Bell is well over here next to my head is in another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana igloo ghost forever 
WgSPTczwVbQ,whoo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo hi everyone who thini Boutin oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new trippy red album life's a trip this is the debut full-length commercial album from rapper and sir trippy red who I last talked about in 2017 off of his a love letter to you to mixtape stylistically he shared a lot in common with all of these part rapper part singers mostly coming out of the soundcloud scene he drew a lot of comparisons to artists like little Aussie vert but I admired him for his general lack of auto-tune on his vocals and presenting his voice in a very naked and a raw form on top of that singing in a kind of aggressive and strained way certainly set him apart from some of his peers too he typically sings in this very high and nasally tone which especially on this new album over here is a little reminiscent to that of like an emo band in the 2000s which isn't as bad as you might think it is though it does occasionally get kind of hideous and unbearable which is pretty much my issue with trippy red up until this point in a nutshell it's not that he doesn't have great ideas or that there's not potential here but he's just a little inconsistent a love letter to u2 was kind of a mess but there was still enough interesting ideas there to leave me feeling like if only this dude's raw talent could be groomed a little bit and some of the ideas he's presenting sort of fleshed out and in some respects I think life is a trip is an admirable attempt at teasing the potential out of trippy red but it's still not without its major flaws for one the entire album opens up with the track together while this track is not as long and as excruciating as the together slash bigger than Satan music video single that trippy red dropped a little while ago it's still an awful way to start your record I kind of admire the lonely twinkling guitars in the mix and some of the vocal melodies trippy brings to the table but the execution leaves a lot to be desired as his singing on this track is absolutely hideous with a lot of very strained raspy just horrendous yelling yeah again I do like trippi's uniquely raw voice but sometimes it just feels like he's totally oblivious as to how to make that work in his favor and if only he could because on the closing track here he pulls together a similar vocal and instrumental vibe to the opener but it's nowhere near as obnoxious as off-key as just generally awful thankfully the first track does get some of the worst singing on the entire album out of the way early though there is another helping of it on the hook of the song bang I prefer the much smoother take a walk which follows immediately after the opening track which has a very watery electric piano some laid-back beats a deep atmosphere overall the track is just some very euphoric and moody trap with a pretty sticky vocal melody and a series of lyrics that Reed is paranoid frustrated suicidal introspective sometimes even funny is that chicken noodle boneless line is a is pretty sharp and slightly a meme my major issue with the song is that there's not a whole lot of structure to it it's criminally short even if again I do enjoy the tune I do enjoy the weird emo esque vocal inflections that Trippi brings to the table which continue to set him apart from a lot of his peers and even though going into this EP my lyrical expectations for trippy weren't exactly high that didn't make swallowing the song wish any easier another track that aesthetically I like a lot vocal melody is pretty cool the beat is very glamorous and glitzy and laid-back the drums have almost a boom bap ish tone to them but these lyrics baby what you wishing for maybe you should wish it more maybe the world is yours maybe when it rains it pours I don't know how to wish anymore I don't know how to wish anymore I guess lyrics like this might come with the emo territory that's so obviously influences trippy but God is it sappy miraculously though trippy can actually pull off very smart entertaining and lyrical track if he wants to which he does on the song missing my idols taking into account these sad gorgeous vocal sample laced through the beat the simplicity of the rhythm and trippy's flow on this the song reminds me of like a little bee cut of course one of his more sad and introspective tracks that could have been uploaded to YouTube five years ago I also found the track revenge to feel similarly based trippy also goes toe to toe with young thug on the track forever ever where he pulls off the whole autocrine thing over a gritty thumping be pretty well buggers performance on the track is great too but it's just one of those moments on this album where I think some better structuring or a stronger change on the hook would have done wonders for this tracks memorability could have given it some more impact which is an issue that plagues quite a few songs on this album leading moments like bird shit to feel more tedious than I think they needed to but the song how you feel is actually a fantastic moment on the album with red singing over these very slinky layers of anthemic guitars it's legit beautiful and it sounds like he's just floating on this bed of guitars this wonderful heavenly cloud of guitars lyrically he even has this Frank but poetic moment where he says I'm trying to pour my heart out how the fuck I'm supposed to sound I guess I'm trying to know how you feel the song reads like he's singing about someone he's in love with and he's trying to figure out how that person feels but some of the lyrics some of the similes on this track can be kind of questionable like when he likens the situation to cookies and a Girl Scout but again I think his attempt here just going full guitar ballad goes over very well and sounds better than a lot of the trap cuts on this record the 2017 single Dark Knight demo featuring Travis Scott also lands on this album it was a fantastic banger when it originally came out and it pretty much still is in the context of the record I love the heavy and rough synth bass all over this track the Sinister pipe organ licks the skittering track beat the dense layers of vocals on this thing this is very much a vibe and an instrumental that you want Travis Scott on the vibe of the track is really psychedelic the hook hits hard and the blend of rapping and singing from both red and Travis are electrifying past this moment though is the last leg of the album which is pretty mild unfortunately tracks the feature some pretty Aric lyrical and instrumental ideas that aren't fleshed out that deeply cuts that are essentially just motifs or vibes or rough concepts masquerading as songs tracks like shake it up and gore and one that I may not even be pronouncing correctly Ooka hookah I will continue to give it to trippy that he has more personality and a larger voice than a lot of his competition but he's still seriously lacking on the consistency front on the lyrical front on the structural front occasionally on this album trippy does hit a home run and the best parts of this record do sound like he has matured a bit artistically but overall he's just as inconsistent on song quality as he was last year which is sad once again because trippy fails for another time to realize his full potential I'm feeling a light too decent 5 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i er view next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry over here next to my head is a another review that you can check out hit that up or the only subscribe to

Wo4tybjxZa8,hi everyone here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new HM Ltd EP hey music last time delete EP this is a new EP dropping from one of the more promising groups coming out of the u.k at the moment HM Ltd or as as they were formerly referred to as Happy Meal Limited I think for a little while now the band has been sporadically dropping these singles that I've been incredibly smitten with songs like Satan Louella and I into the door this rowdy combo of post-punk and pop and rock taking this new and epic clarity to a vintage sound of music giving the sounds of Gotham or high gloss finishing more contemporary aesthetic but without taking away these genres original dramatic and dark edge I have been pretty excited to hear HM Ltd take this sound forward on a larger more sizable project for now that seems like this EP will have to do this thing comes equipped with 4 new original songs the fifth track is a soft sell remix and the whole thing kicks off with these single pictures of you a song that promotionally the band has really been trying to push and get behind and I could see why they're really trying to update their sound on this one taking the pop and goth stylings of their recent releases and applying it to more atmospheric Bumi production and even a track B shockingly the combination of these sounds don't really clash in a horrific way if anything what makes the song underwhelming is that the combination is less than fireworks like it's it's it's not exactly explosive it's one of the more mellow cuts on the EP and production wise it doesn't sound that much different aesthetically from a lot of other pop and rap that's kind of topping the charts at the moment again obviously their intention but I think they didn't do quite enough to put their own spin on this sound outside of a variety of really cool synth patches a sweetly swelling chorus and the vocals from frontman henry spychalski are not too bad either he does a great job delivering this very tour an erotic song it's not an awful song and the chorus is pretty sticky and there are a million ways this cut could have gone totally wrong I just don't think it came out as creatively as it could have there are punchy and modernized new wave cuts on here like proxy love a piece of synth pop with a goth Punk twist sounds pretty much like black eyeliner and clubbing in basements in the 1980s spychalski starts by bringing these really yell p and eccentric lead vocals that made earlier cuts like to the door such a thrill lots of ballsy lyrics and the verses on this track a beautiful synth backed chorus with a grand vocal harmony hanging in the background sounds like something Orchestral Manoeuvres in the dark would have done back in the day but so much more over the top there's a gnarly guitar solo in the last leg of the song - generally I just love the the mix of analog and electronic elements on this track the chorus is this really hilarious overstated vocal line with so much pomp in it we for love that's what web dreamin um then there's the equally amped up track mannequin which has the makings of this perfect obscure story song from decades and decades and decades ago like a novelty song had this band actually started in the 1980s would have brought them to cult status because the track is literally a love song to a mannequin to where Henry is singing about plastic eyes and plastic lips and metal joints and fingertips the instrumental has these beautiful regal chord progressions galloping drums very groovy bass effeminate and very theatrical lead vocals I love the energy of it it's incredibly catchy there's so many great things that HM Ltd have going for them so early in the game the music is great the production is vibrant and fantastic the vocals are wild and full of character the song apple of my eye is a wet and wild piece of goth rock with the swanky guitar licks that twang hard really lowdown bass lines as well this is more the raw rock sound that I enjoyed from cuts like to the door I love that they are changing things up a little bit but I hope they don't depart from it completely as it does give the band a pretty direct connection to those older eras of music that so clearly influenced them the synth pop the new wave again the rakh whereas on songs like pictures of you not a bad track again but those influences seem to kind of evaporate with that production style which again doesn't necessarily need to happen as I think if they were to add more instrumental character and mess with that formula a bit more they could put their own fingerprint on it overall loved this EP thought it was a great EP loved nearly every track on it even the remix this thing pretty much solidified the feeling that HM Ltd is one of the most promising bands out there right now and I'd look forward to when they drop a full-length album not only do I think the band has an incredible amount of potential but if they were to really nail songs like pictures of you then I don't know they could bring this whole trap goth thing to a whole new level not that there aren't soundcloud rappers out there right now who are trying to do that in their own way but hm ltd could certainly put their own spin on that I'm feeling a light two DS and eight on this thing transition have you given this EP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i er view next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video you can check out hit that up or they link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantan oh happy meal happy meal happy meal forever 
knKmh_wfOOQ,hello my baby hello my honey hello my ragtime gal hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for a review of the new Nicki Minaj album Queen this is the 4th full-length album from Young Money rapper miss Nicki Minaj and the title of this thing is no Bluff as for a good part of this decade Nicki has been the number one woman in rap she has certainly earned bragging rights on that however Nicki's long-running career has paved the way for a new crop of female artists who are quickly closing the popularity gap in a genre of music that up until this point seemed almost like it could only platform one or two incredibly popular female artists at a time so with that changing landscape you would think that with this new album from Nicki there would be some kind of pressure to kind of turn up the heat compete at a higher level or do something that's gonna turn a new chapter in her career but instead Nicki pretty much delivers yet another commercial overly focused grouped rap album that feels like it's just trying to do a little bit of something for everybody and in the process really getting to the heart of nothing as there are just as many highs as there are lows on this record not to mention that there's about as much filler as a hot dog I mean there are some decent bangers in the tracklist on this thing hard-hitting instrumentals great flows cold-blooded lyricism and a bad attitude on tracks like these she also shows that lyrically speaking she has more teeth than some of her male counterparts in the mainstream to the song chun-li is one of the lead singles from this album one of my favorites from it the song has lots of irresistible over-the-top flows an e recently some hardpan horn hits in both channels some Gong sounds as well somatically it's a little awkward as there are a few kind of prominent Scarface references and then there's obviously the allusions to Asian culture throughout the track and clearly the song is titled after the street fighter character the track is mostly just hard empowering braggadocious posturing it's not bad for what it is I suppose the song good form brings all of that and more with Nikki rapping even faster and sounding even more cartoonish and animated which has continued to be one of my favorite characteristics of her rap style that she can simultaneously pull off sounding badass but also kind of zany and out there there are some pretty funny quotables throughout the track too like bitch got more coins than the gameroom or see a bitch get more press than a keypad before you suck me off kidding me pad see I pull the strings like a teabag oh that's a good one the song hard white is a more melodic track banger with a lot of auto-tune riffing on the hook though the verses are pretty straightforward and clear it's not reinventing the wheel but it is one of the better tracks on here and Nicki essentially proves that she can kind of do this style just as good as anyone else trying it out this track also features the line never had to strip to get the pole position which is one of the few moments on the album that people assume is kind of like a subliminal shot at cardi B which is kind of an odd point to make because while Nicki Minaj has never been a stripper she certainly never been above using sex to sell her music obviously another favor for me on the album is the song Barbie dreams which is essentially a flip of the notorious b.i.g 's just dreams which if you didn't know is a song essentially about him fantasizing having sex with all of these R&B singers and soul singers and Nicki follows the sexual fantasy blueprint of the song but instead she's rapping about other contemporary rappers saying she's curving 6:9 or she's getting together with young thug but then he's in her closet stealing dresses talking about how dj khaled is fat and she's not gonna tolerate him not eating she's talking about not wanting to bust it open with Eminem in the trailer park talking about Drake crying she even says that designer seems like he's a in special ed the track is smart it's funny it's pure hip-hop its relentless ball-breaking and I love it there are some lesser bangers on the record that are kind of in-your-face they're very kooky but in terms of the writing and the hook and the lyricism are pretty forgettable songs like Miami and LLC and then there are other cuts on here which I like for a lot of different reasons but they kind of fall short due to some pretty mediocre features of course I'm talking about majesty with mm and rich sex with little Wayne mm of course has to rap as fast as possible to the point where he just sounds ridiculous and constipated his series of verses just go on way too long which is again kind of disappointing because otherwise I think the track is fantastic meanwhile little Wayne's verse just kind of leaves me worried about his well-being he's mumbling in a way that just has me concerned like very little of what he's saying on this track feels cogent then there's also Chun zwei featuring sway Lee which I also think had an incredible amount of potential but hearing Nicky and sway Lee go back and forth for six minutes straight over a super Spacey track beat not entirely ideal especially since sway seems to be straining in a really ugly way in a few of those vocal parts there are more mellow and melodic cuts on here which honestly I just kind of find to be filler not because I don't think the album needed mellow cuts for a record of this length that certainly did but for the most part it just seems like Nicki and her features are vocally riffing on these kind of pretty and Atmospheric instrumentals without much in the way of a song planned out the song nip/tuck the song sir with future the song I thought I knew you at the weekend the song run and hide is well for the most part it just kind of seems like Nicki and her collaborators are trying to kill three minutes they're better tracks on here that take a more melodic approach like ganja burns and the song bed both of which have a dancehall vibe to them though that dancehall sound and both song sounds very gentrified commercialized watered-down the song come see about me is certainly one of the better melodic cuts on here - it's a legit piano ballad with a very pretty lead vocal melody but Nicki singing not that she's a bad singer but when she goes in this direction her songs her style just feels so nondescript and I don't know just the inconsistency of entertainment value of songwriting quality even production quality sometimes as a few of these tracks just seem more washed out than others this album just ends up being an incredibly mixed bag like usual I continue to enjoy Nikki's energy personality her lyricism when she is dropping some sharp and funny bars I also like her technical ability I like her Rocchi sexy lyrics I like her themes of empowerment however she continues to couch all of this stuff in really generic production weak songs and then sometimes clips on some horrid features not only that but she continues to work outside of her strengths with without much regard and it's all in a desperate attempt to try to make this album appeal to as many people as possible I get the sentiment I get the strategy behind that but the end result is just an album where it feels like nikki is just throwing random punches through the air just hoping for a stray hit I'm feeling a light too decent five on this thing transition have you

7v0mYN2k16g,hi everyone chop the knee chopped an O here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new valet ep good job you found me this is a new celebratory EP from the Chicago rapper who just signed to Kanye West's GOOD Music label which again is why the title good g.od capital letters good music good job you get it of course he has worked with Kanye recently he's been dropping some pretty hot singles on the internet the most notable of them being womp womp Valley is not the most original rapper who you're gonna find on today's current trap scape his delivery is pretty subdued very amateurish with a slight hint of melody worked in there sometimes his voice isn't as low-key or monotone as other rappers who have an equally subdued delivery like a 21 savage but valley is definitely one of those rappers whose intent is more to pull you in than to jump out at you even when going relatively aggressive on a track from the CP the song skinny where he can be found loudly bragging about the money in his skinny jeans even when going relatively aggressive on this cut of the EP valleys voice kind of hits like a warm breeze out of a hairdryer his off tempo awkwardness also makes the cut kind of a hard listen that awkwardness does occasionally work in his favor like on song shel which sounds enjoyably weird endearingly clumsy over this Basie and skeletal trap beat with all these bouncing and kind of muddy analog synthesizers rolling over each other like dominoes there are a couple of songs on this EP that I think are likable outside of that I'm having a really difficult time seeing what all the buzz is about in regards to valet because for weeks now I've been seeing tweets an article after article saying this rapper stole his flow from valet this other rapper stolen his flow from valet this other other rapper stole his flow from valet and I'm thinking okay everybody's stealing from this guy he must be the next big thing he must have some great ideas bubbling around his head I mean womp womp it is a pretty fun song and the flow of it is kind of unique but honestly the material on this EP the quality of it leads me to believe that whatever happened on that single must have been a fluke because the only track on the CP that borders on being amazing is the cut with Pusha T and I would attribute a lot of that to push a T because there are so many songs on this thing that are devoid of anything that is truly attention-grabbing or memorable a good flow a good energy level some memorable lyrics even a sticky hook the instrumentals are just okay and very basic a lot of the time most of the see if he leaves me thinking what is the point the song I got whatever for example makes the me ghost look like they put an extraordinary amount of effort into their music and they notoriously spend like 25 minutes on a song the song juice and gin is another boring as helll cut that is so slow Val a sounds like he's pretty much just talking over the beat which again is a very cheap and basic trap instrumental the fat bass and the eerie synthesizers on the track V lone are kind of a positive though I kind of like the claustrophobic mixing of valleys vocals on that track and some of the weird metallic plinking arpeggios it's a somber little chord progression it sounds vaguely lo-fi overall which again kind of adds to the weird appeal of it valleys performance on the track does very little to keep things interesting though as his flow is just okay and he continues to have very little to rap about outside of his jeans and what's on his feet which I'm not necessarily against on principle but you got to give me something else like you you have to put it in such a way where it's funny or entertaining or clever or smart or outlandish but know the lyrics are generic the instrumentals are generic the songs are barely there the hooks are barely there this is so painfully average and unremarkable that it's almost offensive and I am NOT hearing like what makes this due to flow wizard because I heard very little in the way of any kind of flow that would be worth stealing by anybody across this entire thing I'm feeling a strong to to a light 3 on the CP transition have you given this thing listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well and yeah that's all I'll see you guys in the next one Anthony Fantana good job you found me forever

out Toto covering Weezer's hash pipe responding in kind to Weezer covering their song Africa which again was their first legit hit in a while so shout out to them on that I guess maybe this will be todos first hit in a long time too so alright let's get into the worst tracks least favorite tracks of the week what were they the worst is to worstest first this new song from the band nothing didn't really care for it the carpenter's son just super bland washed out vaguely shoegaze e in the iraq without much in the way of personality or flavor next we have this new song from mores and tune-yards mango moors is I guess the rap alias of actor Lee Keith Stanfield who you might remember from Atlanta and a lot of other roles as well and while what's going on here is pretty alternative it's maybe ambitious that he'd be making such a bold transition from acting to I guess experimental kind of grimy underground rap music I don't know I haven't heard much else from the project maybe what I dislike about the song that it's so garish and I don't of weird but on a surface level maybe that can be partially or majorly attributed to the tune-yards inclusion here all I know is I found the track kind of annoying I appreciated kind of the fringe sounds that was going for but I just thought it was kind of weak and I guess I can't attribute all of it to tune-yards because I thought some of the rapping some of the vocal delivery coming from Stanfield was a little goofy but I don't know I guess some people are dinging it I guess moving on from there didn't dig the new Matthew Deere singles at all one was super ambient and drawn out to the point where it was not that intriguing the other featured these horrid falsetto vocals that were just painfully awkward new record on the way though I've enjoyed a lot of what Matthew Deere has done up until this point but I don't know I guess maybe we're in for a rough ride with this new record that's that's all I can say and then after that not really digging the new j.cole freestyle I mean look I think the track starts off well good flow some smart bars a cool instrumental choice but then once J Cole starts like talking this utter nonsense about kod being the album of the year and just like spinning all this completely preposterous stuff about like how amazing the the music he's dropping is it it just kind of goes off the rails maybe this album of the year project he has coming up to kind of feed fans in between this and his next album release will be good but I don't know that I don't think this freestyle is all that exciting all right let's get into the tracks I thought were mad weren't amazing weren't awful either worth pointing out worth getting getting your attention on first we have quavo with three new singles he just dropped out of the blue each one of them more generic to the next than the next rather they all sound okay they just kind of sound like a song he would have done with migos but he's just doing it by himself maybe they feel a little bit more preconceived than if he was just in the studio with I guess offset and take off and just kind of you know riff in for 20 minutes and then just kind of slapping that together until it's a song but I don't know that I don't really find anything spectacular about these three tracks you know again they're listenable but if you've heard what the migos have been doing recently what you're gonna hear on these three tracks it's it's not really that different it just kind of feels like quavo by himself pig destroyer new album on the way one of the greatest bands in grind the torture fields is the title of this new track it's pretty heavy its kind of hard-hitting but honestly for pig destroyer it's pretty meat and potatoes and the extremity of their best records is just not really here I mean I do get some of the blast beats there are some kind of thrash e cool riffs here and there the base is sludgy and grinding and and nice but I don't know I just kind of had a hard time finding anything in this track that just really truly stood out to me still looking forward to the new album but again felt pretty meat and potatoes and a little in the yellow not quite as in the red as you expect a pig destroy your song to be moving on from there mustard formerly DJ mustard has this new track out featuring Scott and yg I think it's pretty cool that he brought a beat together that fit both yg and Travis's styles yeah I wouldn't say that rapping from either party is really a spectacular on this cut but it is a good vibe and it does have a good energy Mitsuki has a new record on the way that I've been looking forward to this new single of hers to slow dancers is a heavy chili ballad which isn't as bold as maybe I would have liked to have been but it didn't have a really strong passionate ending to it and the lyrics are especially worth paying attention to so I will give her that but again instrumentally in vocally I just thought it was a little average and maybe nondescript in some respects but still not a bad song not a bad tune maybe just the delivery and the development of it sonically was I don't know just left met one just left more to be desired LSD labyrinth SIA Diplo new song from them as they've been just dropping single after single after single after single and I guess this is one of the more straightforward pop ballads that they have strung together so far the vocals very passionate the beat is bumpin the chord progression some of the vocal lines are a little run-of-the-mill and predictable as you know that descending chord progression that pops in on the hook and is very kind of dreary tugs at your heartstrings has been used to death and I wouldn't necessarily say they put the most interesting spin on it but still it's pretty sweet song it's a pretty sweet song definitely not as gaudy as some of the other singles that they've dropped collectively so far and next Kanye has a new track out titled the ex ecstasy ecstasy new random loose track post da track that he's dropped that has gathered so many headlines because he puts so many lines into this song where he's talking about how he wants to sleep with the rest of like the the kardashian-jenner clan and then he kind of goes off about how X taking ecstasy made him think this or do this or made him inspired to write this and some of the vocals are kind of goofy he really lays hard on those scoop D whoops at one point in the song which when he does that you kind of have to take what Kanye is doing with a grain of salt because I feel like that's his little signal to his fans who kind of remember that random drop that he had or it was just nothing but scoop scoop doop doop I feel like that's a little bit of a signal that he's kind of trolling and fucking with you and just trying to get a rise out of you but simultaneously maybe this song is a signal that great music doesn't always come from drug use because this is what Kanye does on ecstasy then maybe maybe sobriety is the answer because instrumentally it's pretty rough not as impressive as Kanye's beats have been as of late as simple as they have been though I feel like a lot of his recent production has felt simple but genius to me not to use the G word too much around Kanye I know that gets him excited it's simple but smart and this beat however just felt like a mess vocals felt like a mess the lines mostly just felt really cringey and like Kanye was trying way too hard to get my attention one of the few bars that kind of stuck out to me as being funny or interesting was a that one bar about getting 100 on the drug test but again outside of that it's interesting it's kind of goofy it's off-the-wall but I don't it was just really kind of lacking something to actually make me want to return to it again I guess and Joey purp is back nice it's been a while since you've heard from mr. perp was new song over here March 12th is a track where it seems like he's kind of waxing poetic about this relationship that he can't quite seem to I don't know commit to or act right in and he's kind of blowing it and the instrumentals cool his flow is nice I don't mind the topic though I think after a while it grew a little stale and the song kind of really lacked a some kind of B switch or hook or something kind of break it up and just really make what he was pulling together here land it just felt like a linear stream that slowly got more and more lukewarm as it kind of went on unfortunately though it starts it starts hot moving on from there gucci mane and a little little pomp kept back unfortunately it's it's just alright you know not the fireworks we've heard from these guys before and I don't know at this point I feel like little pumps just been kind of phoning in a little bit not that he's shown himself to be a lyrical genius or anything before but I feel like he's slowly kind of showing that he's not gonna be developing his shtick much any times so most likely he's just gonna I don't know probably fade as as soon as his sound is replaced with something else because III don't see him evolving you know I'm not seeing him evolve at all though it is kind of cool to hear him in Gucci trading bars pretty tightly on this track you know it's it's a cool structure I'll say that much on the production is not bad either so and now let's get into the tracks I thought were the best best tracks this week quite a few of those quite a few best tracks we found a lot of tracks I thought were really good so again all these songs linked down there in the description box first trench 21 pilots actually thought this song was really good thought some of the rapping was maybe like a like slightly corny but the instrumental was killer like this super Spacey psychedelic trap beat but it felt totally them you know there were elements of pop and rock work it worked into that beat too that just really worked on top of that I thought the hook was great and I at least liked the flow of the rapping quite a bit and while 21 pilots in the past have hit me as being slightly cringy this song to me didn't really read that way I don't know that's it's I just feel like I'm at a loss I know there were a lot of people struggling out there because I threw it out there on Twitter saying man this twenty one pilots song sounds good in everyone was like what the fuck is wrong with you and hey listen I'm just as confused as you are up until this point I haven't really enjoyed much if any twenty one pilots but I do literally enjoy this song and I do legitimately think that the group this new batch of singles does sound a bit edgy or in a bit darker and a bit more mature than they've been up until this point so I don't know I respect that I respect that moving on from their choice of on very kind of pretty alternative R&B tune over here with some some very creative production that's a little raw and rough around the edges and an alternative aesthetically loaf I in some spots to Troy's previous tracks I always felt we're just maybe a little too sweet for my tooth but this is a nice balance of beauty and I don't know just just a more interesting rough and and moody sounds and textures coming out of this song too and the tune itself is great his voice sounds awesome as it has on previous records but I'll say that this new track animal it just sounds more organic and a little more human then then as previous stuff I'm digging it I'm liking it moving on from there ooh TK Australian rapper TK matzoh from pronouncing a her name right I'm pretty sure I am I caught her saying in an interview a flexin is her new song over here banger alert banger alert beat is fun lyrics are great one Duckworth appears on the track too and does pretty well on it as well yeah it's just a really fun song with a really quirky personality and some funny lyrics and hoping hear more from her in the future I know she came out with a record a while ago killer Mike was featured on a track it had some good standout songs on it but it was kind of hoping for something from her in the future that was a bit bolder a bit stronger a bit more in-your-face and flexing is definitely it moving on from there this new track over here is the latest from freaking soap and skin the austrian singer who i've reviewed on the channel a few times before this new song of hers titled heel is a beautiful little art papé number with shimmering keyboards it's very eerie it's very spacious and soap and skin if you haven't heard her music before she has an incredibly haunting strange voice and that is no less the case here just loving the new song loved much of what she's done up until this point and in my opinion she continues to be one of the most under rated under recognized artists out there so hopefully more people kind of pick up onto this new record of hers because she's got some good stuff going on moving on from there next one next one think about you Ryan Hemsworth and Joe G coming together on this new track over here um yeah well while vocally Joe G doesn't jump out at me because he is kind of going back into that subdued singing style that typically I find a little OneNote but I do think some of his vocal harmonies on this track are actually beautiful the lyrics are kind of haunting and I will say that I do think Ryan Hemsworth his production on this cut certainly makes the track more interesting and complements Joe G's singing better than some of the more skeletal and basic beats that were on his big break out EP so overall this tracks a winner for me it's a beautiful like little weird alternative soul and R&B cut with a bit of pop in there too with again wavy strange kind of psychedelic and surreal production and again for the context of the beat in the song Jody's voice really works so diggin this song quite a bit moving on from there Mick Jenkins is back with a new single Bruce Banner definitely one of his hardest and more lyrical cuts in a while definitely not that patience testing moody shit with very little in the way of flavor that his last album was kind of chock full with kind of hoping he goes back in this direction and experiments more with his sound and his beats on a new release at some point in the future but again this this song over here it's it's it's a banger it's a hard-hitter and it's a thoughtful cut to so digging on that next Marissa Nadler supremely haunting new ballad over here from the singer-songwriter atmospheric experimental indie folk artist dark songstress extraordinaire the title of the new track over here is blue vapor I liked the slightly bolder direction that she took on her last album instrumentally and vocally and I feel like she's coming even more out of the shadows on this new track over here as the vocals are just really upfront in-your-face personal they're they're tangible it's like she's standing 2 inches from your face and singing right in your face and it's like wow it's you you're here this is this is you you've spotlight yourself so beautifully and your vocal performance is absolutely fuckin haunting hair on the back of my neck standing up if I had any because I shave it off but you know when I'm shaving the rest of my hand I don't take a razor on that shit give me a break all right next can mode noise rock and metal core and post-hardcore band they are back new album on the way this new track over here titled not soul mates is as rough wild and savage as I typically expect the band to be enjoy the band to be great risks great drumming great energy no issues with this track just kind of loving the shit out of it it's hard and heavy moving on from their horrendous this metal band that I have just come across just sort of you know look up new tracks across the internet they're kind of a mix of experimental metal and progressive metal but there are some supremely like savage elements to their sound that feel really raw and some nice human touch to what they're doing mostly coming from the kind of slinky base which has an excellent tone and really sticks out in the mix on top of that the vocals have a very unique delivery style to them it's nots weird and annoying or any fucking thing like that but it's it's your it's not your typical standard you know generic metalcore or death metal or black metal vocal where you can't even pick the fucking guy out of a lineup like this is a monstrous angry and very very human but like like total psychopath lead vocal is how I'll put it and instrumentally again kind of going back to that progressive tag that I mentioned with this previously there are a lot of great different guitar passages worked throughout this thing a lot of instrumental changes to that kind of keep things intriguing and keep me on the edge of my seat with it so it's a very smart very aggressive and exciting track over here and again if I didn't say that title of the song which I don't think I did the Idolator is the title of this one moving out from their high on fire has a new track out a new record on the way electric Messiah and it's the title track seems like high on fire and not that these are new influences for the band or anything but seems like they're going a little bit more into a thrash direction on this new track over here and of course the sludge the heavy sludge sound is there - seems like a little bit of Motorhead influence in there as well which again nothing totally new for for high on fire you know just kind of seem like the track hit a really good exciting fun click I'll say clip because I don't know why I mix those two words up with that idiom but I hit a really fun fast clip and it had a great energy to it not quite as slow and I guess as as lumbering as some tracks from their recent records so really digging it really doing that's it's a fun fast cut and good gas which is the new single from fki first rapper producer DJ who basically strung together this track and beat for 2 Chainz in ASAP ferg and it's a fantastic fucking song like 2 Chainz and Ferg their deliveries on this track I don't know who sort of lead who into what direction but like 2 Chainz is growling all over this song like this is one of his hardest and most insane features period not only in terms of just the sound of his voice but his lyrics are fucking hilarious like this is you know based on a true story era two chains in terms of just like the sense of humor and the ASAP ferg totally follows suit with an equally interesting flow and like he's growling all over the track too it's like he didn't again depending on who brought their verse first but uh verse first but it seemed like one did not want to be outdone in terms of the other by the other in terms of just like sounding overly aggressive and hilarious so moving out from their DRAM has a new EP out if you did not know I mentioned it on the show although I need to write myself a reminder to do a little review of this EP DRAM EP and you just came out with a new track from it or rather just kind of separated a track out of it and dropped an amazing music video for it it's titled best hugs don't miss it it's it's one of his best songs or one of his best ballads and definitely one of his most playful and tongue-in-cheek as well loved rim love the guy and behemoth has a new single out which I did not mention in the last weekly track roundup which is titled God equals dog and it's a nice heavy blasphemous black metal banger with some interesting guitar riffs and amazing like child chorus toward the end of the song that's actually pretty devilish maybe instrumentally it's not as over-the-top as some of the cuts that were on the Satanist a little while back but it is actually really fantastic pretty powerful and looking forward to kind of hearing this track grow on me a little bit as we near closer to this new behemoth album release and that has been the weekly track roundup but actually not quite as I also wanted to shout this new effects twin song and mr. Richard D James also has an EP out which had just dropped but the song and music video that he just recently released is titled t69 collapse and it is a fucking amazing track holy fucking shit one of the best songs richard has come out with in a long time the amount of detail in this beat is mind-bending it's like he really takes the whole IDM thing to the next fucking level and some of the B switches in this track too like around the midpoint where these warp dark synthesizers pop in out of nowhere and throughout the whole thing that the percussion is insane so listen I can't say enough nice things about this track it's fucking awesome this track is fucking awesome easily one of the best singles of the year so don't miss this track it's absolutely insane and review of this EP very soon so alright cool I'm gonna leave it at that you guys are the best again all the songs that I talked about linked down there below and you can find that again along with the Amazon and turntable lab associate links and shout out once again to the good people over at geek who sponsored this video love you love you love you Anthony Fantana music music music weekly track roundup forever 
e3AZwLk0Was,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's a little late but it is still time to do another installment of our great album series where I go over records from this past month that I was kind of partial to and I linked down some stuff in the B box where you can listen watch reviews and that sort of thing and just make sure that these records that I think are special did not slip through the cracks for you so let's go of course first off I have to shout out the new Denzel curry album taboo it's an excellent rap record hardcore hip hop trap influences on this thing conscious hip hop as well kind of works in three separate sections that kinda have their own defining characteristics and sounds but really what makes the album so great ultimately is Denzel Curry's flows his delivery his aggressive persona his sharp wordplay and on top of it his his great beat choices on this thing - so just Killer production killer flows good hooks as well he's really kind of increased his talents for writing sweet melodic choruses and the dude is is really kind of coming into his own becoming a great talent as far as this new wave of hip hop is concerned so look out look up look up this album it's a great record next I want a shout-out Haruna Murray this new record over here is easily one of my favorite j-pop and j-rock records of the year it mixes elements of like I just said pop music electronic music noise pop alternative rock post hardcore - and hip hop because she literally is rapping at a very fast clip on a lot of these tracks in a really impressive way it's a very eclectic record but very catchy - it's not super masturbatory or so experimental that it's trying too hard or anything like that for the amount of the influences that go into it it sounds very smooth harmonious and well put together and that's it's a really creative unique mix of pop and rock and a lot of other things - good songwriting as well great crisp vivid production I've definitely got to give the album that and yeah just generally enjoying this album quite a bit so don't miss it next I have to shout out new avant-garde metal band Imperial triumphant for the most experimental blackened death record that I've heard this year with some very colorful vocal additions on this thing to some pianos are worked into this thing some elements of jazz some giant hellish choruses of horns as well this is a very dynamic creative metal record which was mastered recorded engineered by one mr. Colin Marston so shout out to him as well he produces a lot of metal records that I think are pretty fantastic and yeah it's just really creative off the wall again blackened death metal album interesting mix of extreme metal influences on this thing again with some outside sounds coming from other genres mixed in a very avant-garde fashion intense playing intricate compositions on this thing dizzying riffs and drums and yeah just generally impressed with how brittle tight hellish noisy and epic this album is next the new serpent with feet album easily one of the most creative blends of art pop with R&B and more that I've heard this year if you like your stories of love to be a very lusty very lovesick very obsessive almost disturbing don't miss out on this thing also the vocals are very standout and unique there are some moments where I think the production is a little skeletal a little lacking or some of the vocal mixing could have been better but I do think serpent with feet is shaping up to be one of the best artists in this genre as long as some of the more technical things having to do with the quality of the sound and just how things on on these records are kind of eq'd and mixed end up getting smoothed out on future releases and finally I have to shout out the new zeal and ardour album stranger fruit which is an amazing blend of black metal and slave spirituals which I still can't believe that those two genres of music are coming out of my mouth and they work so fantastically well together on this album this is a hellishly fun and unique experience again even though these genres of music coming together on this thing are very unlikely the marriage is actually quite natural and exciting and I don't know just just try not to think of it as two different musical worlds existing and just appreciate it for just how good and crisp the production is how great the riffs are how passionate and unsettling the vocals on this thing are and the interesting themes of blasphemy and also injustice on this album - and those are going to be my recommendations for this video hopefully you guys enjoy these records get quite a bit out of them and I guess one more shout out that'll do is the new James Ferraro EP which is a really cool collection of sharp MIDI compositions looking forward to seeing where he brings that in the future and I'm gonna gonna Coast coast off of that so all the information down there is linked in the description box you guys are the best and I will catch you in the next video transition have you given these albums a listen did you love them did you hate them what would you rate them you're the best you're the best which an Ayurvedic feel like please subscribe and please don't cry or we're here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana music forever

UgwPxFUUg94,ah hi everyone oh no dear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Mac Miller album swimming this is the latest full-length album from rapper singer-songwriter producer Malcolm James McCormick aka Mac Miller Mac Miller has had a pretty long and interesting evolution going from young Freddie pop rapper to left-field stoner rapping over flying lotus beats these days though the guy seems to be kind of trapped in a moody emotional rut where Mac's understated bars meet underwhelming instrumentals with some very mony singing and vocal lines that sound like Mac is simultaneously trying to hold a tune and a mouthful of water of course I'm talking about max last full-length LP the Divine Feminine a record that I found so traumatically boring that it feels like it came out six years ago to me even though it just dropped in 2016 I don't know as far as this new album goes I went into it just crossing my fingers hoping for some kind of change but no swimming is yet another attempt by Miller to speed ahead in the syrupy alternative R&B lane but the end results are about as fun as rush-hour traffic the beats on this thing are consistently lifeless Spacey and bland which kind of hurts to say because looking at the production credits of this record there are actually a lot of producers here that I like generally the beats on this thing are pretty Pleasant occasionally they are show-stopping ly pretty like in the case of 2009 but they're mostly wallpaper from the wavy trap beyond self-care to the revving farty synthesizers on the closing track so it goes occasionally a rhythm might pick up on this thing with a good beat and a great bass line most notably on the track what's the use but I have never heard an artist who so effortlessly turns a funk rhythm section into something that sounds like you should be napping to it of course Mac Miller singing on this record is still mony Weezy flat and awful he still doesn't seem to have much in the way of any vocal presence as his pitch tone and volume are still really weak and there aren't really any weird or eccentric qualities to his voice either to me get appealing in an unconventional way moments where max singing is in the spotlight like on the start of perfecto or on the end of self-care in my opinion border on parity and our borderline excruciating meanwhile every warble e squeaky vocal line throughout 2009 despite the tracks gorgeous intro just feels like I'm locked in a torture chamber I'm wanting to scramble for anything that will drown out the sound the car horn a chainsaw a crying baby because on this track makkal only sounds like two or three shades less comatose than little zan does occasionally a melody that Mac rocks might be kind of cute like on the intro track the very heavenly come back to earth but always time time again throughout this record his execution leaves so much to be desired there are some moody low-key jazz rap cuts on this thing that go over pretty well like her feelings or the kind of silly small world's cuts where max bars they may be understated but his sense of humor and his wordplay really shine through but these tracks are maybe the only two that I enjoyed from front to back while his rapping on the rest of the record isn't usually that bad he consistently gets in the way of his own good ideas by delivering this awful singing where again he's coming up short vocally and melodically sometimes even getting in the way of some of the better instrumental ideas on this record like the detuned ambience of the song wings mac pretty much plays the role of wet blanket on this album taking away more than he adds to the record with this like soul-crushing sense of listlessness and that's what it is this sense of ennui I mean the record doesn't even sound particularly sad to me it just feels emotionally vacant you either get moments like that on this record were spots where strangely enough Mac is sounding kind of goofy like over the celebratory funk of ladders or to mention the closing track once again so it goes yeah overall I didn't really care for this album at all I feel like Mac just continues to work outside of his strengths and shows absolutely no effort to improve upon the very obvious weaknesses that his last album showed oddly enough what Mac has been doing lately reminds me of the maturation trajectory that that sounds really pretentious but you know his his getting more mature over time kind of reminds me of a Tyler the creator's progression recently but it's like Mac on the similar path is somehow getting worse I can appreciate that he's trying to get more melodic I can appreciate that he's trying to get more personal in his music on paper what Mac is trying to do should work should be fantastic but what he actually comes through with on this album is just too blase for words I'm feeling a light two DS and three on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't

HCF5ZNTsce4,hi everyone TOS violation here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the brand-new yg album stayed danger West Coast rapper yg returns with a brand new album just two years after the release of his pretty fantastic still breezy a sophomore record that saw the Compton native really coming into his own with better flows sharper hooks more focused song topics it's like he suddenly became twice the rapper that he was on his somewhat underwhelming debut a few years earlier my crazy life not to mention still brazii featured production all over it that was a bit of a West Coast throwback in a way reviving the 90s heyday of West Coast hip hop and G funk I love the sound of that album I love what yg brought to it personally I saw no reason for him to change lanes but yg is clearly coming into this new album Hungary he clearly wants more of the spotlight he seems to have a clearer idea as to how he wants to go about that and he is switching gears to do it so yes stay dangerous is a change of pace for yg it sounds new to him but in terms of the current hip-hop meta it sounds old meaning that for the most part yg has pretty much delivered a generic trap album on this one in hopes that it will most likely gain a wider appeal for his music and maybe it will the first week sales for this thing could be through the roof for all I know all I can really do is comment on what I hear and this album pretty much sounds like yg and the process of trying to make a more commercial album has thrown out a lot of what made him appealing as an artist originally you only need to hear the first two minutes of his awkward attempt at an autocrine ballad with quavo on the song slay to see that the stories and narratives on this album generally are non-existent or they don't seem quite as high-stakes or interesting the track production on this record when it does come up is pretty bare skeletal basic occasionally to the point where the beats sound kind of goofy like on the song big bank or handgun with ASAP Rocky or the track too cocky it was it was a pretty easy paycheck for whoever came through with these beats I'll say that I mean occasionally the minimalism of these beats does work and it makes for a kind of interesting listening experience but for the most part it just takes the wind out of YG's sails there's also a multitude of repetitive mind-numbing effortless hooks all over this thing Canada Canada Canada I've got it I've got it I've got it nowhere near as sweet compelling or as memorable as something like twist my fingers also the weak flows from yg all over this thing barely even eliciting a head Bob for me I'm tracks like ten times where he just kind of has this awkward elongated moaning delivery that doesn't really do much there's also a lot of trendy features all over this thing whose performances and lyrics are average at best the only people on this thing that really sounded like they were going for it were Jay 305 easily the best feature on the entire record Nicki Minaj who was pretty animated and quirky on her appearance with big bang and miraculously I kind of liked the young boy never broke again feature on 666 he really kind of fit the tone of the song and it's easily the grimy astana entire album with yg saying anything that's bad for him it's right here in his face reflecting on his downward spiral of bad decisions and self-destructive behavior there are some moments on this record that are pretty personal and pretty thoughtful where yg reflects on the negative effects Fame and his entrance into the hip-hop industry is had on his his person on his physical well-being on his mentality the track deeper than rap is a great example of that kind of the same thing with the track money Fame which musically is one of the few tracks that vibes exactly like a song from still brazii but now just the the narrative the tone the setting has changed since yg has become this hot in-demand rapper there's also the free the homies interlude and Bobtown finest where yg seems to be contemplating changing his trajectory because he's seen where his decisions have also landed his friends and also seeing the way that his life changes and his fame has changed the people around him turning some friends against him maybe making him also think about his role as a father too this album is actually pretty good when yg uses his knack for storytelling to approach the life shift that hip-hop has brought him and even though it's a pretty familiar trope at this point it is compelling to see him struggle to make this decision between unnecessarily continuing forward with this life that he used to live and then also the the path the choice the option that the music world has provided him sadly moments like this only make up a sliver of the album a lot of the material on here just feels like really general rat bangers with more posturing than a narrative songs where yg seems to be at a total loss for anything interesting to say - cocky handgun again also the song bulletproof unfortunately this album presents an all-too-familiar scenario for artists who have gained popularity in the music industry they either get a taste of fame or they hit it big and they want to maintain that popularity or make it larger so they hop on a prevailing trend they water down their sound to the point where the new album is bland as hell and the artist sounds like a lesser version of their former selves there are a handful of good tracks on this album toward the end a great deal of the material up until that point is at least listenable but given the quality of his last album I'm kind of shocked that yg would drop an album that is this generic because even on my crazy life as flawed as that album was I at least got the sense that he was trying to make something of substance this time around not so much I'm feeling a decent two strong five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if the Bell is well over

vggLspSf7tw,nobody bitterroots hi everyone Jesus in world's Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another edition of our worst best series where I go through the studio album catalog of a major recording artist and I rank their albums from worst to best in this video I'm going to be going over the 8th album catalog of the band Talking Heads they are a band that formed in New York in the mid-70s broke up in 1991 I believe they made a pretty significant impact on the worlds of punk rock dance and pop music for the entirety of their studio album catalog the group held on to four core members guitarist lyricist and singer David Byrne bassist Tina Weymouth drummer Chris Frantz and guitarist Jerry Harrison or these are at least the roles that you would see each member playing if they were performing live each member of the band was kind of a multi-instrumentalist in their own right contributing an array of sounds and musical ideas across the band's discography Talking Heads was also one of the rare instances of a band with roots in the New York punk scene going on to achieve mainstream success through the rise of New Wave though they were always kind of an oddball in whatever musical trend they may have been inadvertently surfing using way too many genres together to be snugly fit into one musical category whether it be the fusion of punk funk and disco on their earlier releases or the sounds of Afro beasts salsa and Latin pop that would turn up on their later albums Talking Heads were also notorious for their high-energy larger-than-life and creatively staged live shows the band's live albums actually stand - some of their most significant releases and stop making sense is considered to be one of the greatest live albums and concert films of all time so if you'd like to hear any of the material on these albums that I'm about to talk about in a new light I highly suggest checking out those live records stop making sense and the name of this band is Talking Heads if the band is completely new to you I might even suggest to try those records first all that being said though here's the list yeah I pretty much think Talking Heads worst album is their final album their 1988 record naked and no not just because this is a hideously tacky album cover my dislike for this record is for a couple of reasons I mean at this point I can kind of hear the band's personality fracturing their identity fading as David Burns new obsession with salsa in Latin pop is kind of overtaking the sound of the band's new songs bringing on foreign music influences isn't necessarily a bad thing of course Talking Heads already pulled it off beautifully on their album remain in light with these sounds of Afrobeat but on naked it doesn't feel like there is as much pressure to incorporate it into their sound creatively or put their own spin on it and maybe to a degree they do but it feels almost like an inadvertent twist meaning that it sounds like David Byrne and company were trying their best to recreate the Latin and tropical sounds on on this album authentically speaking and then of course bring some societal critiques and the lyrics on tracks like nothing but flowers but I don't think the result of the album really lived up to the vision as the music doesn't sound like an authentic take on these styles of music instead it comes off more like distended bellies and Hawaiian shirts and cargo shorts on an expensive cruise ship there are also moments on this thing like the facts of life which is a super ill-conceived foray into these sounds of industrial music there's also the really dramatic and tedious Democratic circus or the song Big Daddy which easily features some of David Burns worst lyrics of the eighties yeah while it's not the worst album in the world I wouldn't recommend anybody try it first it's it's listenable and I guess it's kind of intriguing to see what the band's last moments were like as far as the studio goes okay so talking heads second to worst album is their second to last album in my opinion their 1986 record true stories which is really an odd album for Talking Heads because throughout their career they were always on the cutting edge ahead of the curve breaking the mold sounded like no other group out there but oddly enough true story sounds like Talking Heads playing catch-up with New Wave and just embracing every pop and rock cliche of the 1980s with all these gated drums and chunky guitar riffs and straightforward grooves on a great deal of these tracks even david burns vocals seem a little less eccentric that is when he's not overdoing it on the incredibly obnoxious wildlife where he's kind of growling his brains out miraculously this song was a kind of popular single charting higher than a lot of the band's legendary singles up to that point even once-in-a-lifetime so I guess there's something to be said for going with the flow as this album might have been talking heads trying to maintain their new popularity after these smash successes of stop making sense and speaking in tongues and little creatures Plus this album is also connected to the David Byrne film of the same name in which Talking Heads band members give little cameo appearances so maybe given that the songs were going to be connected to the film David was trying to make them as straightforward catchy and as punchy as possible I mean I'm just guessing here there's also the track Radiohead which famously inspired the band Radiohead to name themselves Radiohead which is a kind of quaint high-gloss piece of pop doubt ska which could have easily landed on the camper van Beethoven album that dropped just a year before the album is okay but overall it just kind of sounds like Talking Heads are beginning to lose their identity and their sense of self on this one next there 1985 album Talking Heads little creatures interestingly enough their biggest selling album in my opinion is one of their least interesting after an entire career so far of pushing boundaries and challenging norms and sometimes even setting them because in their side project Tom Tom Club Chris and Tina did come together with some new wave banger some synth pop essentials on little creatures Talking Heads essentially settled down for a pretty plain as straightforward pop rock album which incorporates elements of country on a few tracks here and there even the little creatures is by no means a terrible album it's still in a way marks the beginning of the end for Talking Heads after the one-two combo of speaking in tongues and stop making sense it was almost like the band was at a loss as to where to go stylistically next as a result David and company kind of stripped things back to the barest of essentials on this one instrumentally speaking not too much on this record in the way of dense layers of instrumentation hard grooves experimental weird production in a way the band kind of goes back to the simplicity of their Talking Heads seventy-seven record years and years ago which is not necessarily a bad thing as Byrne in the band or kind of standing on the merits of the songwriting they deliver on this album which there are many good examples of like and she was and with it on the road to nowhere again you kind of have that cute country number in the mix on this one creatures of love in which david byrne addresses the topic of romance and forming a lifelong bond with somebody in the way that only someone as awkward as David Byrne could there's some total duds on this thing like walk it down which features these awful farty since working their way through this lumbering instrumental that is just absolutely hideous but overall it's it's not that bad it's kind of a mixed bag there are some great songs on here don't necessarily avoid it just because it's not considered to be one of the Bands best next we have the Talking Heads album more songs about buildings and food their 1978 record just a year after the band released their debut and the time between these two records Talking Heads gained the attention of one Brian Eno they would go on to record three pretty cutting-edge albums with him obviously this is the first of them however I think more songs is the least interesting and the least cutting-edge of the three as the album just sounds like a slightly more polished version of the 10 spunky dance rock sound Talking Heads were delivering just a year earlier sure it's slightly more elevated and built out a little bit with some organs some piano splashes of effects that make things sound a little bit more alien like on the track warning sign or the robotic I see synths that kind of pluck their way throughout the track found a job I like these miniscule additions to the band's sound quite a bit but I can't help but see this album as just more of a transitional moment for Talking Heads as pretty much every album they would drop immediately after would be far better produced better written much more adventurous and some of my least favorite Talking Heads songs land on this album at least my least favourite versions of them as nearly every song on this album that also turns up on their live album the name of this band is Talking Heads I pretty much prefer the live version the differences between the studio and live versions of tracks like girls want to be with the girls is just like night and day the energy the grooves just the delivery of the performance David Byrne is clearly in his fullest form the track off this record artists only david burns vocals are completely buried beneath the sour synthesizers and milky bass let me stress here that Talking Heads in their heyday were an incredibly awkward band and this was kind of a selling point it was a definite personality trait many of David Burns lyrics would delve into his own difficulties with expressing his humanity not to mention his personal fixations on things like buildings and houses this painful social awkwardness would manifest itself in the way David Byrne sang as well and in the way the band's music moved the sense of unease is deafening on albums like 77 and more songs keep in mind this album wouldn't even have a hit if not for take me to the river which miraculously brought the album to gold status and it's kind of strange because that track stands out like a sore thumb in a good way on the record as it feels like one of the most natural and relaxed cuts on the entire album and so does the closer Big Country I mean generally the album doesn't sound as boxed into its own anxiety as it nears the finish I think more songs is still a pretty good album even if the execution is kind of off I still can't really think of many albums in the late 70s that sounded like this and I can see why there are so many people out there who would rate it highly but I just personally don't see the record as their best getting into the second half of this we have Talking Heads debut record seventy-seven I was just talking about the awkwardness that pervades the album more songs and it's also here - in spades on 77 even though over time I did come to warm up to this album so much more because the production on this one is pretty balanced and straightforward it's also hard not to hear the incredible amount of potential in the fusion of dance music rock music and funk music that the band was working with at this point straddling the mainstream in the underground in a way that few bands were around that time and doing it with this unsettling performance style that would also set them apart from every other band this album strangely enough is equal parts clunky and slick the sound of the drums the guitars the bass the vocals on this thing might have been slightly claustrophobic but Talking Heads made up for that with great grooves great tunes and lots of personality just oodles of it which mostly came in the form of David Burns very weird vocal mannerisms where it mostly sounded like he was trying to feverishly contort himself into some normal portrayal of human emotion the song happy day sounds like it's trying to express some genuine moment of joy but instead with its erratic rhythms and David Burns y LP singing it feels like anything but the song no compassion is about the difficulty of accepting and understanding other people's feelings and points of view and we also have David Byrne almost role-playing on this album too on the single psycho killer one of the most iconic rock songs of all time where David Byrne can be heard lyrically indulging in these irrational thoughts and volatile behaviors the lyrics on this thing sound like the ramblings of the criminally insane maybe the most genuinely thrilling and upbeat song on the entire record is the closing track pulled up to me quite possibly one of my favorite Talking Heads songs hands down pretty much a track about being lifted up out of the emotional dumps by another person despite a couple of criticisms I have of the way this album sounds and vibes generally I think 77 is an excellent album a great start to the band's career solid from start to finish lots of great songs on here lots of great performances even if they translated better on live albums it's almost impenetrably uneasy as well as endlessly compelling it's as creepy as it is catchy and I absolutely love it next the 1979 album from Talking Heads fear of music the second full-length LP that the band would record with Brian Eno and this album for the band saw a massive transition into basically a bigger sound better production slicker grooves grander presentation more overt references to musical styles hailing from West Africa most notably on the song eyes Umbra which you can hear all over the congas of this track the background vocals some of the insane guitar licks on this cut to Robert Fripp actually features on the song as well sadly these are not musical influences you will hear in spades throughout the rest of the album more consistently they are explored on the band's next record remain in light that being said though fear of music is still a really excellent album and pretty much embodies its title as it sounds like David Byrne and company on this album are using music as a throughway to explore and express ideas about fear and the neurotic tendencies of the band in general the dance grooves and the sickening on ease of Talking Heads typical sound on this don't seem at odds as much as they've been in the past it feels like they're informing one another now and of course I mean that in a very good way there are cuts on this album like cities which are incredibly tense but are still undeniably easy to dance to as the bass and drumming on this track are fantastic meanwhile David Burns manic ramblings about urban living are maddening the instrumentalists hustling it's bustling they're weird crunchy rhythm guitars all over this thing to some metallic clangs as well in the mix like there are some points of this album that feel almost vaguely industrial the song mind seems like a creepy and obsessive dive into the psyche of someone who can't let go of someone else's stubbornness wondering if they can get drugs or science or religion to change this other person or maybe David Byrne is making some kind of at large societal critique to which is most likely the Kay says this is not his first time doing such a thing on record I also love the squeaky guitars and the strained ghastly background vocals on this cut to the rubbery bass there are also slow burner cuts on here that are a bit more ethereal and light on the ears like the song air which miraculously ends up being pretty terrifying when you read into the lyrics that cut there's also the very pillowy heaven these cuts are easily two of the Bands best ballads the latter of the two show David Burns thoughts wandering in a refreshingly existential direction where he's kind of waxing poetic about an afterlife heaven is where nothing ever happens almost expressing a distaste for an afterlife where the tension of of living on earth the given the take of everyday living would be missing the grooves on this album generally range from incredibly hard and physical like on life during wartime whose this ain't no potty this ain't no disco refrain still stands as one of Talking Heads best hooks and then there's the crushing and hypnotic memories can wait which is easily one of the most nightmarish songs of the 70s with it's twisted synths and heavy guitars and booming drums all gaining this frightening quality because of David Burns disembodied screams and howls in the background it's like he's trapped in a never-ending freefall down a spire the song animals is eyebrow-raising and paranoid with these layered lead vocals that sound gigantic almost like a voice has gotten into my head and is controlling my thoughts with all of these manic and paranoid ramblings about animals laughing at you or I guess judging again it's weird and freakish and completely irrational but these are feelings and emotions and mentalities that talking heads tend to embrace and highlight there are a couple of spots on this album that feel kind of typical or plain for talking heads at this point mostly the song paper or the song electric guitar which to me musically and topically is pretty much a dud still a fantastic album though and a great next chapter in the Talking Heads catalog so don't miss this one next on the list second best in my opinion is the Talking Heads 1983 album speaking in tongues a record that brought some pretty significant benchmarks for the band this record is essentially the first that they would record and release after splitting off from Brian Eno after remain in light this record also brought the band's first top 10 hit with the track burning down the house the record pretty much went two times platinum over the years and the album would essentially set the stage for the tour on which the band would record stop making sense and this record is really truly Talking Heads first big commercial breakthrough yes imagine a time in the music industry where it literally took a band this long to have a top-ten hit and they came out with album after album after album after album and the record label didn't kick them or anything now it's not hard to see why that song and this album would be as popular as it is the whole thing slaps this thing is like 80s dance rock bangers the grooves on this thing are tight they're layered they're overwhelming they're huge killer bass lines and drums great pacing the rhythm section on this thing is colored beautifully with sticky guitar lines and synth leads or experimental noisy bits like on tracks such as girlfriend is better the sounds the Talking Heads are playing with on this album are nothing entirely new but I think the band hit this supreme moment of clarity with the writing performance and production on this record where pretty much everything about the band's style and music sounds so effortless and natural there are also lots of large and bold vocal sections on this record - David Byrne brings some excellent vocal performances the whole album is is a great balance of incredibly weird but supremely catchy talking heads usual nervous energy is really working to their benefit here especially on cuts like slippery people the band also takes a huge risk on the song swamp which is kind of like their take on some southern lowdown rock and roll ZZ Top style also this must be the place is seen as one of the Bands best songs period as the rudimentary instrumentation of the track is pretty cute david burns vocals are very passionate and generally the sentiments of the song or heartwarming the album is pretty much incredible and is one of the Bands most consistent and solid and just brain mind blowing up records period uh next finally my favorite Talking Heads album in my opinion the best Talking Heads Elm their 1980 record remain in light the third album the band would record with none other than Brian Eno features excellent tracks such as born under punches and of course once in a lifetime this is easily one of the most cutting-edge albums in rock music and dance music and pop music the way the band recorded it in the digital fashion that they did pulling some of the musical bits of this record and sort of working them into loops was totally like oh my god who the else was doing that also the way that David burning company incorporated afrobeat into their repertoire on this record - was pretty game-changing pretty much like on speaking in tongues the songwriting quality the production quality the performance quality it's all very very high but remain in light in my opinion has the added benefit of sounding like a futuristic fusion still sounding pretty futuristic today in my opinion of again rock music disco music funk music electronic music afro beat David Byrne not sounding quite as smooth as he does on some points of speaking in tongues though but in a good way he's much more erratic by comparison on this album and I think again that's kind of a benefit to the records dark strange alien and again futuristic vibe aesthetic it's for these reasons and more that when I did a classic review a little while back I've kind of jumped on top of the opportunity to talk about this record I highly recommend that you try to watch that review as well to kind of get my full full full thoughts on this record because I do think it's absolutely amazing I do think it's absolutely excellent and very well deserving of the top placement in this worst to best list and that's pretty much

t4RjOz8dKro,hi everyone Houston e10 tanno here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new travis scott album Astroworld this is the third full-length album from rapper singer producer and songwriter Travis Scott truth be told I didn't really think that much of Travis Scott when he first burst onto the scene as a Kanye West protege the 2013 al farro mixtape showed a very impressionable Scott drowning in his Kid Cudi and Kanye West influences barely a properly assembled and mixed project as a lot of the songs on this thing just sounded like a mess his 2014 days before Rodeo tape sounded like it had a bigger presentation a bigger budget but still very much a mess overall it seemed like an experimental but a misguided take on the current state of trap although Travis did seem to be getting more distinct vocally and aesthetically with all of these spacey beats his heavy use of auto-tune a kind of dark psychedelic style was bubbling up so with these couple of releases I did not foresee the incredible contribution to pop rap and trap that Travis would be bringing the very next year on his 2015 album rodeo it's like everything Travis was shooting for on previous efforts just made sense here with the Warped vocals the heavy use of auto-tune all the crazy zany animated ad-libs the multiple phases that many of his songs worked through the additional features on this thing the trippy instrumentals Travis was building himself up not to be just an artist but also a curator much in the same way that a Kanye West or in ASAP Rocky or a dj khaled sort of plays a directorial role on a song bringing a lot of different talent together like in the pop rap equivalent of a play where he's trying to get every person involved in a cut to create something bigger than the sum of its parts after all on this very album Astroworld there is a track titled sicko mode where Travis does drop a line saying who put the shit together I'm the glue there were some very epic singles off of rodeo that still burned for me today like Nano to Mono 3500 antidote these tracks and many of the deep cuts on that album just made for very sound rich mind-altering catchy trap music with super-sweet almost elegant hooks sometimes for the genre it was just a really refreshing approach with some very top-notch production which is why Travis's next album birds in the trap just left me so confused it's it's such a demotion in quality if Travis Scott's rodeo was the total package then birds in the trap was merely the hollow vibe left over from it little in the way of material or songwriting on this album that you could call infectious the Travis thugger collaboration pick up the phone is maybe the best track on the entire record outside of that it just kind of felt like Travis was merely delivering the trippy aesthetic of his last album but without the same level of impressive guest performances production the multiple phases the memorable hooks the surreal instrumentals the album felt kind of effortless and it was really shocking just how tedious some of the songs on this thing were it's now been 2 years since the release of that album although travis has in the meantime put out that honcho Jack Jack honcho collaborative record there is that but even though travis has been keeping busy it doesn't seem like he's been as eager to jump right into his next album and I was kind of worried going into this thing not just because of the nasty taste that Birds left in my mouth but also because the lead single from this thing butterfly effect felt very much like another helping of the redundant formless flavorless song writing and structuring that was so prevalent on that album thankfully Astroworld is kind of a return to form for Travis in comparison with birds I find that Astroworld brings better hooks better production better features and he also gets back in the habit of bringing awesome beat switches and musical detours into the fold the song stargazing is a pretty great intro to the album and also shows Travis reclaiming the throne as the king of vibe maybe this track is not as grand an entrance as T I literally narrating your musical come up but in comparison with rodeo astral world seems to be a lot less autobiographical and more of an exercise and aesthetics and mood so on this track we find some round bass some snappy trap percussion some sparkly watery guitar notes of course all of this is playing against a few layers of Travis Scott vocals some very animated ad lids it's lit some scratchy auto-tune wailing and of course Travis's deep lead vocal delivering some lyrics about like a drug-induced insanity with a very melodic flow overall the track is pure euphoria and undergoes some very beautiful instrumental shifts before kind of closing out into complete silence for a beat switch where Travis starts rapping about pretty much his current state with some pretty wild quotables I love the line of this leg in the track when he talks about how it's not a mosh pit if there are no injuries it's cool when Travis drops a line here and there that's actually kind of funny or sticky or memorable but above all else it sounds great following this track is the cut carousel which is just as drenched in psychedelic delays effects and some pretty odd samples there's this persistent sound of a crowd in the background faintly going I love the use and placement of Frank Ocean on the track to his understated choruses very sweet and moody when he gets into his upper register it's pretty passionate and fiery there's something about the sound and the vibe of the track that reminds me a little bit of The Flaming Lips but almost like trap music answer to that with the purposefully pristine and and very sparkly synthesizers the rumbly distorted bass the sound of the track is simultaneously unsettling but also really blissful and there's something about the song that despite its sounding so psychedelic and out there it feels incredibly cogent Travis Scott just seems to write psychedelic hip-hop music from a very meticulous detail oriented and almost sober place my one issue with this track might be some of Frank's incredibly esoteric lyrics which come off kind of disjointed maybe they're more symbolic than I'm understanding them to be but either way the track is a highly for me I love the transition from the end of this track into the false intro of psycho mode featuring a little bit of a like a partial of a Drake verse there's this murky chunky bass that follows up immediately after with a beat switch with SiC flow from Travis and a lot of lyrical debauchery after yet another B switch Drake returns with a full verse and performance Drake brings this really gentle smooth delivery that works perfectly with the airy instrumental ease found himself on top of I don't really take issue with his lyrics outside there seems to be a moment where he raps about taking half of a xanax as described to fall asleep on an airplane until his plane lands and while there's absolutely nothing wrong with taking prescription drugs as directed by a medical professional that's not really why there's such as an craze in the hip hop community right now it's not really why rappers rap about the drug you might as well be dropping a fucking verse about taking aspirin all that being said though do not take prescription drugs recreationally they will destroy your life and fuck you up thank you speaking of Drake though some of the quick musical transitions in song on these tracks compounded with how some of these tracks splice into one another as they're starting and ending actually reminds me of Drake's more life playlists in some respects there are moments where this album does have the feel of a carefully assembled playlist but obviously Travis produces this thing to have more of a futuristic tone and to be more than just musical wallpaper the song r.i.p screw is a tribute to the late and legendary DJ Screw whose contributions to rap music through chopped and screwed and just the houston scene in general have been hugely influential for Travis Scott on this cut Travis brings some super wavy synthesizers some warped vocalizations from sway Leah Rae sremmurd Fame some weird low five vocal samples as well it's a decent track it's very low-key its kind of Spacey it's got a nice vibe to it but in my opinion it's not musically or structurally as impressive as the following cuss stop trying to be God which i think is the closest Travis comes on this album to legitimately pulling off a ballad and no that's not just because James Blake pops up in the last leg of the song delivering these gorgeous lead vocals some enveloping church organs and an orgasmic harmonica solo with that that I assume is coming from Stevie Wonder because I know he has taken part in this album it has it's on this record too but also Travis is singing and very somber rapping in the first moments of the song are pretty beautiful in an odd way the hook on this thing is very understated and sweet features some very sweet Kid Cudi hums and lyrically Travis finds some introspective expressions with a lot of lyrical nods to strippers rollies and commandments the song no bystanders is another highlight for me but still kind of a head-scratcher the track opens with this bold manic proclamation the soaring lead vocal Travis Scott saying that he's on a plane for ten hours he's telling the the the people on the plane there's no flight plan if Travis Scott was so nervous on planes maybe he should have gotten the other half of that his antics from Drake earlier on the album and then he would have been calmed down thank you this song hits a really weird juxtaposition where the synths drop out and then all of a sudden you have like these gang vocals just chanting which could be a three 6 mafia reference maybe a little John reference or something then transitioning out of this we have the verse which lyrically is coming from another place entirely it's such a cohesive sounding song musically each section of the track segues into the next beautifully and smoothly but thematically it's so disjointed in all over the place it sounds like the the creation of someone whose mind is going a million miles a minute the song skeletons is a kind of okay detour in the tracklist the instrumental on this cut is handled by none other than tame impala so you can kind of expect a very nice crispy Basie psychedelic pop throwback with a lot of synths on this one but the rapping the flow and the delivery from Travis is a bit underwhelming as it sounds like he's mostly living in Kanye's shadow on this cut he is trying so hard on this track to pull from that direction but his lyricism while it is vulgar there's not really anything in the way of interesting wordplay or a sense of humor or personality coming from that or really his inflection his tone there's also some kind of fuzzy loaf I buried weakened vocal riffing on the track - maybe he could have taken a brighter or more significant spot on the record but I think his inclusion at this point on the album is merely a teaser a warm-up for his incredible contribution to the next track wake up with a very light beat some acoustic guitar licks and a lot of really ghostly and and trippy and strange little musical effects and tidbits kind of popping up in the background it's like the song is haunted this track in my opinion is far superior to that of any time Travis and The Weeknd have been on the same track up until this point I also love the trippy rush of synthesizers of the mid point on this track with Abell proclaiming that this person who is singing - controls his life whether he lives or dies and if he ODS he dies alone with no heartbeat pussy so good pussy so sweet even though the lyrics on this track and many other moments are super rudimentary and straightforward and really just kind of gets to the point that there is something beautifully blunt about it I guess it's high impact it's high sensuality I'd say the lust of this song is intoxicating then there is the excellent 5% tint with an awesome goody mob reference right at the start who's that with some heavy rumbling bass and these really like lo-fi distant very regal piano chords boom button Tenten also some ghoulish laughing samples popping up in the background like they're off some Halloween tape or something it's fantastically dark and weird and enhance very nicely with these gorgeous little swells of strings and scents and also features an outro that is so heavenly it makes the 902 a no single from a few years ago sound plane the song nc-17 also finds subtle ways to tease elegance out of the trap genre with the tracks beat revolving around these plinky metallic wintry melodies Travis delivering this chorus very melodic flow with more harmonized background vocals cavernous ad-libs there's this beautiful rush of almost classical pianos and instrumentation that sort of flies into the track just before introduced to a nice 21 savage feature actually one of his best features in a while with the stand out your bitch gave the kid cudi but I'm not signed to yay i nutted on her cheek her new name is babyface but not the only time on the track that I laughed out loud I also thought it was funny when Travis said eatin the poo nan made his braids wet I love the following cut Astro Thunder Travis goes into kind of a psychedelic folk direction thanks to some extra production and instrumentation from John Mayer and Thundercat not something I would have expected him to pull off as well as he did but yet he does it there's a kind of important lyrical mantra on this track that I thought I would point out with Travis talking about how it seems like he feels or like life feels a little distant and it does seem like on this album there is kind of a wall between Travis and reality because this is one of the many spots on the album that just feel like an extended lucid dream the song you have 70 is a kind of Pleasant cut on the album but not all that significant up-and-comer gonna has a pretty prominent placement on the track he really takes over a great deal of the song though I don't really care that much for him vocally he just kind of sounds like a poor man's young thug Travis's vocal contributions not nearly as memorable or as standout by comparison there's kind of a fizzled finish a very weak ending to the song and navs feature in the last leg of the track is just mixed solo it's buried it sucks I don't even know why it made it onto the track if you are not going to put it in a place where people can actually hear it why would you bother now after this point unfortunately I feel like the quality of the album starts to go downhill a little bit not anything that I think is absolutely trash but a lot of cuts that just kind of pale in comparison to the first few sections of the record the song who what has a banger beat but a kind of awkward flow from Travis which is a little unlike him typically he brings a very catchy head-bobbing flow but not here unfortunately migos popping onto the track do very little to save the situation to the synth arpeggios and the one-two-three-four-five chorus on the cut are pretty much the only standout things about it after listening to it multiple times and within the context of the album I still don't care that much for butterfly effect to me structurally lyrically melodically instrumentally it just doesn't really seem that significant once you've heard the first half of the song you've pretty much heard everything that you need to hear and much of the time unfortunately without a standout instrumental when Travis is completely alone on a track it does tend to expose just how weak lyrically and vocally he can be as shown on the closing track which is a very low-key cut with a chill laid-back beat not nearly as trippy and soaked in effects as a lot of the other songs here mostly because Travis seems to set this personal introspective tone on the cut like you're going to get this verse where he's kind of spilling out his guts and really letting you know what he's thinking but lyrically Travis lacks the ability to string together anything on this song that is truly significant or meaningful I mean he kind of alludes to his relationship with Kylie Jenner ending or having to pay alimony payments maybe frankly it's really disappointing ending to the album even with some of the lavish string additions on it Houston fornication isn't as redundant in structure as some of the other tracks in the last leg of this album but it is very much redundant in spirit like conceptually aesthetically what is this track really adding to the tracklist at this point it just seems like another Spacey trap cut which Travis does well it's his specialty but I kind of feel like he runs the risk of staling out his sound by throwing more tracks like this into the mix with no catchy hook no interesting guests and no interesting transitions to enhance Travis's performance which one could argue that maybe that exposes a lack of talent on Travis's part that he can't hold the track completely on his own and just have it be fire but personally I think there's more than one way to skin a cat make a good record or be a good artist and unfortunately Travis's talent for directing guiding and curating great ideas isn't as sharp as it could be throughout this entire album as again I think the quality and the excitement of the record trails off in the last third to a great degree all that being said though I do think this record is far superior to that of birds and it does seem like Travis is putting in the effort once again to not only make great tracks bring great content forward but also push the trap sound into the future and continuing to keep open this through way between hip-hop and psychedelic music and the mainstream can't say this thing blew me away but I still think it's a very good record with a lot of great tracks on it I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next

turntable lab 1 and you buy yourself a record or some speakers or a turntable we get kickback from it so there you go alright let's get into the worst tracks of the week we're Strax of the week whoop okay first sane with Timbaland too much new single sounds kind of like just boring Justin Timberlake song but since that seems to be one of Zane's main inspirations and Timbaland is involved who has worked with Justin on multiple occasions that should be no surprise so again just kind of sounds like a boring Justin Timberlake single but I guess better than a lot of the awful country pop rap fusions on his last album so there's that moving on from there to the new Robbins single which is just way too long and uneventful and very very bright very glitzy very shiny I guess but yeah the lyrics are pretty vapid the vocal melody doesn't really do much for me and overall it's just kind of a snoozer let's move into the tracks that I thought we're just kind of okay just kind of all right but not really blowing me away necessarily first the new wind hand single if you love your stoner metal your slow sludgy heavy psychedelic very patient stoner metal it's had elements of grunge mixed in I recommend that you give a shot to this new wind hand track over here great garden is the title of it so give it a shot moving on from there the duo known as uniform apparently are now working with drummer Greg Fox of liturgy Fame who's actually been in a lot of groups over the years super talented percussionist and before uniforms sound to me was pretty noisy pretty industrial now it seems like they're going for a bit more of a raw Punk thing on this new track over here which is titled alone in the dark it's super scuzzy it's super loaf I may be to a point where it kind of takes away from the greatness of the track but it's still a very visceral very like horrifyingly nasty sound and experience which I'm kind of in awe of just how nasty this song and recording is even if some of the riffs and some of the vocals do kind of a standard hardcore underground like very dirty filthy Punk aesthetic to them moving on from their Sleaford mods has a new single out new EP on the way I believe stick it stick it a five and go is the name of this new track over here not quite as hooky as some of their more recent material where it seems like they've been trying to do their best to sweeten up their sound to get it to appeal a little bit more widely this kind of goes back to the roar just straight shouted rambling poetry aesthetics of the duo's earlier stuff which you know if you like that roar or sound you're probably going to dig on this it's it seems like there's something here going on with a gripe about just misery and hatred and provocation in the social media age specifically over Twitter on this track so I guess do keep that into mind as you enter into this song moving out from there shado Connor recording under another name Magda davit has a new track out and I'm kind of torn on this track like there are a lot of great things about it I love the lyrics I love how personal and just how downtrodden and honest the lyrics of the track are also on top of that the I guess her voice kind of cracks in this terribly honest way like the the vocals are very blemished I think that also takes away from the tune a little bit the lack of a strong song structure kind of takes away from the track quite a bit too but I feel like her delivery is passionate on here the lyrics are very compelling the emotion of her performance is certainly there it's certainly strong and potent I just think a stronger I don't know the song structure here like would have been a bit more necessary to kind of make this have some more impact but pretty excited she's recording new stuff and and maybe some better stuff coming down the pipe so moving on from there Freddie Gibbs has a new single out titled burn rubber not bad it's kind of grimy hard-hitting bassy trap beat Freddie drops some nice TripIt flows on the cut you know pretty grimy pretty hard next we have a new track from UK singer and songwriter Ella Mae she kind of blew up off that remix of the track booed up a few weeks ago because I had some pretty big features on it this new song over here is titled the trip and I found to be much more impressive than that track maybe the features in my opinion kind of took away from her a little bit on the song but her singing on this track is pretty great the instrumental very rich very classy there are some elements of the track that I just kind of feel like sound just like you were the mill almost adult contemporary very commercial R&B sound it's very nice and pleasant to the years I guess I just wished that there was a bit more of a risk factor involved that the vocal performance was a bit stronger but she's certainly shaping up to be more impressive than I originally thought she was off of her last single so I don't know just kind of looking forward to seeing how she continues to grow and progress with these uh new singles new series of tracks moving on from there cheer drug church new record on the way and this single that they have recently released is titled avoid Arama and yeah you know there's there's something about this track that's difficult to place one could take the flatly delivered vocals and the heavy kind of scuzzy guitars and the mid pace of the song and say hey this kind of just sounds like a grunge track or something like that but in fact the song actually sounds like even though it's coming out in 2018 like a bit of I don't know proto grunge like it sounds like somebody consciously trying to slow down the sounds of hardcore punk and add a bit more balladry to it I know it's kind of difficult to sort of understand what the way that I'm explaining it again some people might sort of listen to anything and this kind of sounds like a grungy rock song or something but I think it's a bit more I don't know I guess raw and rough around the edges on that and the tune itself isn't too bad I mean I think this the band's sound overall does come off a bit dime-a-dozen maybe he feels that way more to me because I grew up during an era where this sound was very prevalent but I don't know it's it's not bad it's a cool single and oh yeah Death Cab for Cutie autumn love new track over here which I was kind of impressed with some of the vocal melodies that Ben Gibbard approached this track with the song is not nearly as like just throw it out the window as the band's last single as their last song sure the production is still kind of bland and the oh oh look is a little overboard but uh but still a Death Cab this new single sounds better than the last maybe the new album will be decent who knows and also want to shout out in a Calvi for this new song over here titled hunter which is obviously the title tractor her new album um Anna's always had a pretty eerie sound this song is really no different though I do wish there was a stronger sense of structure to it I think the atmospheric chilling hair-raising instrumental is quite nice I think her twisted eerie squeaky lead vocals are very evocative but uh but again it just kind of feels like a stretched-out motif or a vibe as opposed to a a cogent song or anything like that but still a potent freaky vibe that let's move into the tracks that I thought were the best this week as songs I was impressed with the most starting off with ooh sumac sweet sumac the noisy experimental post metal band has a new album on the way following up there a recent collaborative record that I followed earlier not followed but reviewed earlier this year that I thought was pretty awesome this new song of theirs is a 15 minute monster and it's titled a das's blade now this song and it seems like this new album is different than any other core band release that they are put out up until this point because with their last album it's almost as if a switch has been flipped and now like with their last record but again not a collaborative release here they're delivering longer songs noisier songs more experimental songs this new track over here is loaded with like ugly distorted just like dissonant freaky herky-jerky guitar work that is really abrasive some pretty heavy riffs at some points on this thing too I think maybe some parts of the track are a bit too drawn-out in terms of the noisy guitar passages and everything but I do like the bold noisy direction the band is kind of taking things in on this new track so I don't know new record seems like it could be shaping up to be one of the Bands most experimental as far as but again core band releases so looking forward to that moving on from there spiritual eyes has a new track out they've been teasing new music for a while now and I'm pretty excited about that the song is titled here it comes the road let's go and like a lot of spiritualize songs there are elements of soul and old-school rock and roll and obviously a huge Velvet Underground influence in what they're doing the mix on this one and this could have a lot to do with me hearing it over YouTube sounds kind of thin and a little rickety I'm kind of hoping that the the studio or rather the the full version that I hear later on the album gets released as a bit bass ear doesn't sound quite as is I guess thin and jangly but the ballot itself is very solid I like the guitar work a lot there are kind of like these incessant ticking like rhythm guitar sounds or effects or samples or something persistently kind of clicking away throughout the track that are kind of strange and add to a bit of a surreal psychedelic experimental quality to the track that's kind of cool moving on from there moving moving moving on from there the BAM Appetit and waar which is a music project that I have only become aware of recently thanks to this new single new album on the way blame a fire this song is a fantastic mix of South African music pop dance electronic music the vocals on this thing are fire the beat is insane and the blend of influences is incredibly vibrant and creative really looking forward to sort of seeing whatever this project is going to be delivering on subsequent tracks again not not a music project I'm all that familiar with but this this new single is certainly making me want to become very familiar in the near future moving on from there nina cherry has a new track out produced by none other than for tet and 3d of massive attack fame and it's not a bad new single her vocals are great the instrumental is very dark some weird work base on this thing it's it's kind of a mix of subterranean electronic music and soul just as one would probably assume you know cherry would deliver after all these years because you did have a comeback album a while ago but I was kind of lack a lacking in enthusiasm on that album honestly but this new single over here is actually pretty good so looking forward to maybe somewhere interesting producer credits coming down the pipe on this thing too because it is pretty awesome to see Four Tet working with someone with as much you know I guess popular music you know history as is her moving on from there woohoo Moses summoning man rank and file new track new EP on the way very soon this new track over here really just kind of like flipped me a little bit on some knee his last record I did comment on and say that you know there's a cool mix of influences here that you don't usually hear together including elements of you know just soul and art pop and it sounded like there was like a lot of Thom Yorke or Radiohead or Bjork vibes coming through on some of the vocals and compositions as well but this new song over here seems like it's coming from a completely different place not only from his wild and eccentric lead vocals which really just like made him sound so much more distinct than I've ever felt he has sounded before on top of that the the conscious reference to these old-school military marching chants was really interesting as well like a really smart and corporation to the composition on this track to just vocally instrumentally conceptually just a really sharp creative track and very bold to yeah I don't know if I could say enough nice things about this song the new EP that this is gonna be slated on is it's looking like it's gonna be pretty short so I don't know kind of stinks that it's gonna be a super short as far as an EP experience but as long as somebody continues to drop material that is as bold as this he's always going to be an artist to be excited for so no matter how much material he's dropping in in in one go so all right moving on from their new Interpol single number 10 enjoyed it so much more than the last one not that the last single was all that bad felt like a more raw and aggressive change of pace but the vocals just felt kind of yelping and weird but this new track over here Paul banks is singing in a somewhat more familiar delivery and the tune is pretty solid as well kind of looks like Interpol has dropped I don't know the the the facade of predictability a little bit with their recent releases and have kind of lit a fire under their asses again they sound hungry again and that's what I think has made this new album cycle pretty exciting so Interpol number ten loving it so far and ooh Tim Hecker this life this is a nice change of pace for Tim nice change of pace as you guys may remember I wasn't you crazy about Tim's last album but this new track over here feels glacial you know there's some amazing droney qualities and incredibly creative bits of sound play on this track that I think is fantastic and it's an eight-minute cut too so Tim is really kind of in it for the long haul on this track and it really goes the distance again interesting harmonies and Tambor's and sound play throughout this track great drone and even though again it is a droney track the sounds that tim chooses are very bold they're very colorful you know I love Tim's approach to drone as of late you know because it's it seems like he's sticking - those euphoric mind-numbing kind of mind-altering qualities but using such prickly vibrant intriguing sounds that it's it's almost as engaging or it's it's really as engaging as a more formal composition so are really digging what Tim is doing once again on this new track moving on from their future has a couple of new songs out a titled blame not not blame uh one is titled a scam a lot and the other is titled translator and shockingly I enjoy both of these tracks scam a lot because I think futures flow on that track is so excellent the words are more intelligible than they typically are and I love the 8-bit quality of the instrumental and again to go back to uh did I say yeah that was scam a lot that I was just talking about now the other track translator is is a track that it's it's one of the few songs from future has a super formal chorus where you have like a little chorus line coming in and it's not just him kind of warbling about with some auto-tune over barely shifted instrumental some kind of repeated line or refrain until it just goes into his next mumbled verse to me it's sort of interesting to hear future over again a formal chorus but it works really well and it seems like he's trying to be a little bit more narrative and lyrical than usual so I don't know it's a good instrumental it's a great tune it's a great vibe and I think future just has more musicality than usual on this track so shout out to him hopefully kind of keeps this trend up and I don't know realizes that there's nothing wrong with changing your sound and maturing a little bit I guess alright moving on from there ooh this is the first church's song I have enjoyed in a while although the track is like a j-pop crossover with Wednesday Campanella which is an act that I was kind of unfamiliar with up until this point so yeah you know it's it's just kind of a blend of churches you we'll send pop qualities with some j-pop and j-rock and it works out really well you know who knew this marriage would be so functional so yeah out of my head good single hopefully we see more collaborations from churches like this in the future or something or we see more I don't know international crossovers like this in

5zf-_mQYwu8,oh good hi everyone all ffunny good tan oh here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new James Ferraro EP four pieces for Mirai this is the newest EP for a multi-instrumentalist composer and producer mr. James Ferraro who I haven't covered on the channel in a while not since my 2015 review of his album Skid Row a conceptual and industrially tinged fusion of pop alternative R&B and sound collage a unique in experimental ode to LA in the 1990s I did not really care for the album myself but if my description of that record does pique your interest do give it a shot you might dig it more than me and do keep in mind that album is merely one sliver of James very expansive discography which he has been compounding furiously since the release of that album with releases like humans Story 3 and burning Prius as well as troll a lot of releases that see James diving back into the world of sequenced MIDI instrumentation and feeling out some new-age modern classical progressive electronic and ambient music in the process four pieces is still very much in that same stylistic vein but a lot darker and glitchy er this EP seems to feature a lot of the same futuristic themes that human story 3 did but feels like a dystopian answer to the mostly utopian imagery of a perfect technocracy that a good portion of that album presented doesn't seem to be any kind of narrative connection between those two records though although four pieces does seem to have its own narrative according to the band camp page that James posted this project on stating that this EP is merely just a prelude to a longer more epic work about the decline of civilization in the information age there are four major electronic music pieces on this record which are bookended by two decent intros and outros that kind of set and finish the tone of the album very well the intro track fossils features a bunch of sounds from a variety of places a phone that sounds like it's kind of ringing goes unanswered crows cawing eventually the sound is kind of submerged in water there also some lonesome keyboard arpeggios what sounds like the internet booting up I wish the compositional element of the track were a bit meteor but the cut does convey a strong sense of desolation and emptiness this is the conceptual landscape on which these compositions live the core compositions that follow this intro are all really dense multiple phases no exceptions the song Green Hill cross features these icy cascading synth tones then things start building up with some very nice arpeggios the track blossoms into a composition of a variety of different synth Tambor's it's layered beautifully there's a sweet glitchy midriff on the track too that's introduced by the shot of distortion it's like for a moment the composition just degrades before your very ears it breaks down and then shifts into a second movement where the main themes of the song thus far are revisited with some booming kick drums some glistening pianos - after years of working with these MIDI sounds James has gotten a knack for working with them in such a way where not only does he embrace how cool and sterile they feel a lot of the time but he has gained the ability to make them sound very expressive evocative and sometimes even larger-than-life the song butterfly has an intro that's colored with these huge gargantuan chords they almost feel like a religious experience the chord progression has almost like a medieval tone to it the next phase has these plucky synth harps some more subtle and ghostly synth tones kind of fading away and swelling in the background it's almost as if James is composing this piece for a large-scale Orchestra the track eventually hits a stride with these sort of abrasive synth intervals that are almost like industrial eventually this builds up with these speedy bass melodies kind of flying by in every direction it seems a little random for a moment but the track does have a very cohesive finish the song Mirai is one of the more tortured and despondent pieces on the EP the thing is very cold very exploratory especially at the start eventually these runs of synthetic drums pop in they hit hard they're pretty dramatic these monstrous gargling vocals kind of pop into the mix it's like James is a Racing a black metal aesthetic for a mere second the amount of influences in electronic music in traditional composition and like extreme metal all popping up in this one section of song is just so overwhelming it's crazy how many influences he's pulling from in this in this one spot and typically influences that that don't really ever have anything to do with each other it makes me excited for what James might have coming down the pipe in this ongoing series because what will these genres return and in a bolder and bigger way and I'm loving the numerous transitions on this track as well as a lot of the other songs on here too you know James has been writing a lot of electronic compositions lately and I have grown impressed with just how great he is getting at making these eight-minute monsters sound really logical and cohesive from start to finish keeping things really engaging from an aesthetic standpoint also a compositional standpoint the song remnant is okay I find it to be one of the more uneventful compositions on the EP lots of very chai me frigate synthesizers being played throughout the whole thing the track feels like an Ice Age covering the earth turning into a lifeless tundra it's consistently smooth I just think maybe James could have added a little bit more to accomplish a'no Lee or could have gotten this same point across with potentially shorter runtime this is also another moment on the album or some of the chord progressions heavy distinctly medieval tone golf gutters is kind of a strange ending to the EP in that it's one of the more vocally intensive tracks on the entire record there's a good chunk of the song that sounds like James is kind of singing or screaming his way through some kind of digital matrix he sounds like a ghost or a demon who's trying to break through a computer screen or through some kind of coaxial cable maybe he's playing the role of some kind of satanic malware of course this vocal is placed over some very pristine beautiful ringing synth tones and what sounds like some plucky guitars which might be synthetic as well another moment on the EP where I hear just a lot of interesting compounding influences brought together with some very compelling compositions overall I think this is a pretty cool EP I could see it being one of my favorite EPS of year I do wish there was a bit more to it or rather it just leaves me wanting more it leaves me excited and kind of sitting on the edge of my seat for what the rest of this series is going to hold Ferraro's approach to midi and sound play on this thing is pretty refreshing and I can't wait to see how he continues to push forward this dystopian concept he has drum together on this record I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this thing transition have you given this EP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you're ready to hear the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana James Ferraro forever 
iSEfSwPsMNE,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an interesting little list video that we're about to embark on I've been at this whole reviewing thing for a long time and over the course of the almost 10 years that I've been running this YouTube channel I have reviewed hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of albums maybe even thousands at this point but even though I managed to keep pretty busy on this channel unfortunately I cannot and I do not cover everything there's only so much time in the day I only have two ears and only so much brain capacity so as a result some records don't get covered some records fall to the wayside others I just kind of wrestle with until I just forget to do any kind of coverage of them whatsoever which is why I have come through with with this list 15 projects that I I wish I reviewed at some point now keep in mind this list is not to say that these albums have become my favorites that they've grown on me for some of these albums that is the case but for the most part I think each of these records represents an interesting part in the musical underground or mainstream that I simply wish I put in my two cents and that's all so let's go [Music] yes first James Ferraro's farside virtual while this is not a perfect record I still think it's a pretty significant moment for electronic music for Internet music in a way for vaporwave aesthetics sure I suppose one could call this album gimmicky but it still remains that this record is a fantastic attempt at trying to take the the vibe the aesthetics the sound of what was music for a certain time in in commercial culture this technological time in the late 90s in the early 2000s when Gateway computers and CD ROMs were like the wave of the future taking that clunky dated MIDI electronic sound and then trying to transfer that over into some legitimately interesting instrumental compositions is an idea I completely fuck with and one that I think I appreciate a little bit now more than I did upon the album's initial release sure you could say that James has come out with deeper and more significant projects since then ones that don't necessarily center around a single or a surface level idea NYC hell is certainly an example of that but as the dust is settling on Ferraro's growing discography farside still stands as one of the more interesting detours in his canon so i guess give this album a shot if you'd like to hear electronic music that sounds like the soundtrack to an alternate reality where technology is improving our lives instead of destroying it [Music] the next record that I wish I covered the year it came out is the 2010 death spell Omega album pair Cletus death spell Omega if you're unaware is a metal band from France that for a long time has been fusing elements of death metal black metal avant-garde metal and progressive metal into this dense winding layered intricate and tangled web the band has been added since the very late 90s and para Cletus is pretty much a crown jewel in the band's discography one of the highest points of their entire Canon and even though in 2010 I did have an appreciation for at least some of those genres and extreme metal in general sometimes the more progressive and avant-garde stuff does fail to land with me there are competing bands whose records I covered that gave me a bit more of an appreciation for the style I went on to appreciate the following EPS that dispel dropped like diabolic adidas and also a drought listening to the band's following releases and having to go back and try their old stuff just gave me I guess just more familiarity and allowed me to untangle the very difficult web that Paraclete is presents unfortunately there were just a lot of factors working against my timely enjoyment of the album being distracted by other albums needing the time to properly process what the band was doing which I most likely would have been able to do faster had I been more familiar with the Bands previous material but you know that's kind of the thing with the needle drop I didn't go into this with all the music knowledge in the world a lot of the time I'm kind of learning as I'm going along and unfortunately as a result of that there are some reviews that I kind of miss out on and I wish I did but that's the point of this video isn't it [Music] you know I have to give a shout out to walk a flock of flames flock of le I really do I wish I covered in depth this album at the time it's crazy to think about this album now in 2018 because of how unique it was at the time the reception of the record which of course this album had bangers on it of course this album had fans but a lot of rap fans hated this record they thought the production was annoying they thought waka flocka flame his lyrics were dumb that he couldn't rap that his whole delivery was just a gimmick just a shtick just trash that there was no hope and there was no future for this dude and maybe in some respects the critics of this album and waka in general were correct because hey you know while he does still drop some decent music for the most part it seems like Waka's time in the limelight is pretty much up unfortunately but the spark that Wacha and lex luger created together on this album the cultural the musical spark they ignited on this record would go on to influence a whole new generation of trap music now of course this album is not the first trap album I wouldn't even argue that it's the biggest trap album but this album elevated in a huge way a once purely southern in a pretty underground sound and I unfortunately was like a lot of people reacting negatively to this album reacting to essentially the lowered bar of lyricism portrayed on this record just how redundant a lot of the production was and as an album experience it is kind of one-dimensional but if you completely erase this album from the history books I don't really know if you get the same shape of hip-hop today because how many of the current crop of soundcloud rappers are greatly influenced by Chief Keef who before that was inspired by waka flocka now of course waka was not the only artist that Chief Keef was listening to and without Gucci Mane putting him on I don't even really know where Waka's career would be so we can't really look at flaca vely as some kind of inception point of trap me as we can't look at it purely in a vacuum I still think this album though is a foundational block and a lot of the current trends we see in hip-hop music and as a result at the time I just wish I covered it and and maybe in covering it had the foresight to see the ripples of influence that would have next album on my list is little ugly Mane's mr. thug isolation which is an album that maybe a year after not covering it after it had been released I kind of immediately regretted not doing so because in retrospect I see the album is a pretty significant moment for enternet hip hop where around the time this album was released it was kind of this new trend to be a rapper that kind of solely thrived off of the internet had mostly just an internet-based audience not necessarily climbing your way up the ladder purely through whatever local scene you happen to be born into and even though I did go on to enjoy quite a bit of little ugly Mane's later material again I do wish I covered this album not only because of what it represented for a music culture as a whole but also because of the the dark twisted pathways that ugly me and sort of takes trap and southern hip hop through on this album at the time I felt like the record was a little gimmicky and and maybe I still feel that way to a degree because of the down pitched vocals and how kind of goofy and cartoony some of the tracks sound as a result of it still though there's no taking away from the dark lyricism and production all over this release and also the incredible amount of influence that this album went on to have on Soundcloud rappers on artists who are trying to revive this super old-school dark kind of satanic three 6 mafia style Memphis rap sound but updating it for the Millennial or Bandcamp rap generation so certainly one of the more interesting hip-hop releases of the decade just just which I covered it [Music] this next release that I wish I covered at the time is the grouper aiaa lien observer double-album Liz Harris is a singer songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who has been recording music under the grouper name for a long time she has covered a multitude of bases across her discography so far and truth be told her records are little hit or miss for me I'm not crazy about a lot of the material that she drops as a result of that I think I went into this new album over here with my guard up higher than it most likely should have been the length of this project the amount of material she handed over to fans on this thing might have made me a little skeptical at the time - not to mention that the recording on this album is pretty low fie a little abrasive to the point where it does kind of a prickle at my eardrums a bit in a slightly painful way I sound like I'm almost trying to scare you off of the album but I promise you I'm not because I actually think this record after taking the time to fully process it and appreciate what Liz was doing on this album I think this record is great easily one of the best ambien and drone albums of this decade unfortunately it took me a while to come to that conclusion but the amazing and distorted and tattered soundscapes that liz pulls together on this record along with her disembodied alien ghosts leave ocol work together in an incredibly hypnotic surreal and unsettling fashion give it a shot yourself given an open mind recommended and again regretful that I did not cover it at the time that it was a originally released [Music] next I would like to talk about the mark kozilek and jimmy lavalle album perils from the sea as a lot of you following the channel may know we do quite a bit of coverage of the cause around here maybe not every album here releases because he is quite prolific these days and I do try to cover all the major stuff I like many other publications celebrated marks 2014 release Benji an amazing album that was essentially a third wind in the singer-songwriters long spanning career from his own solo stuff to Sun Kil moon material - of course Red House Painters and even though Benji is a fantastic record certainly deserved the widespread acclaim that it received truth be told the material on that album isn't really that much different than a lot of the stuff mark was recording up until that point I mean of course is a stuff was still very funky still very narrative and conversational certainly he hit upon a perfect balance of storytelling and balladry on Benji that maybe previous albums didn't quite figure out yet and perils from the sea unfortunately is one of those albums that I think has been lost in the general lack of appreciation for marks material pre Benji this thing came out just a year before Benji I didn't cover it because I don't even think I knew it existed and it's pretty much one of the best full chronica albums ever the glistening gorgeous and glossy electronics that Jimmy brings to the table make for an excellent setting when it comes to mark storytelling I don't really have anything else to say about the album other than I just wish I listened to it or I was aware of it at the time had I had the ability to hear it and give it the appreciation it deserves that easily would have been one of my favorite records of the year so uh yeah but at least I can listen to it and appreciate it and and and promote it now so there you go [Music] next I want to shout out the Leonard Cohen album you want it darker I was aware of this record at the time of its release I did talk about it in Hawaii no review I did listen to it I wasn't too crazy about it I've come to appreciate the album a little bit more in retrospect as I've really only been a fan of Leonard Cohen's classic material up until this point his gravelly voice his thoughtful poetry the background singers the obviously dark instrumentals on this thing have all slowly added up for me over time it's also tragic that we've lost Leonard Cohen since the release of this album though I suppose he did end on a high note with this record between the album growing on me and just the loss of Leonard Cohen in general I just wish I covered this record in full and gave it the the full review that it obviously deserved next I want to shout out the father John misty album for your fun yeah just wasn't too crazy about this album upon release I thought it was an OK singer-songwriter record with some pretty grand reverb E instrumentation here and there though not nearly as epic as what Josh would later deliver on I love you honey bear I did recognize his very sharp sense of humor his wit on this album though I don't think it was quite as bold as what he would display on subsequent albums while fear fun is still not one of my favorite father John misty albums I just wish I covered it [Music] next the Bell which album mirror Reaper that dropped in 2017 yeah I wish I covered this record and I'm not even sure if I went through the entire thing with the review be super positive or super negative but bail which is one of these slower more patient due me or more atmospheric metal bands that really kind of takes their time with their work and they have kind of a unique approach to the genre on this new record over here as they seem to be fusing it with the slow Korzh onra which is not really anything that i've heard a whole lot of doom metal bands do unfortunately though at the time I think I was just a little too slammed to even slow my own brain down and appreciate the the subtleties of what this album had to offer as I felt like I couldn't even get enough of a sense of it to truly even boy all my thoughts down into why you no review segment effectively I definitely see the album as one of the more unique records in the metal underground this decade I just wish that I took the time to slow things down and appreciate the album for that in a full-length review [Music] this record is an incredibly colorful and insane totally off-the-wall black metal album Peston war is a french black metal project and this is easily one of the Bands best albums today it is an insane multifaceted offensive nasty gross and creatively composed record with not only harsh and fantastic passages of raw black metal but also some interesting bits of French music and folk music worked into the the album's repertoire too it's maybe one of the most versatile and theatrical black metal albums that I've ever heard at the time I didn't end up covering the record and I did do a video talking about how I took somewhat of an issue with the album's messages of nationalism and some of the more gruesome lyrical bits of the record but in retrospect I just wish I said fuck it and just covered the album [Music] next tracks man the mind of tracks man which is an electronic music record one of the album's that got quite a bit of attention in at the time what was somewhat short-lived resurgence of footwork music on the Internet of course the scene in the genre is still thriving in the niche that it came out of this rhythmically intense and intricate electronic music genre was getting an interesting breath of life thanks to records and artists like this sure the record is pretty long-winded and footwork is a very very very specific genre so don't be surprised going into this album if you feel like a lot of the songs kind of groove and vibe the same way I also feel like the aesthetic of footwork musically constantly tapping the snare drums the off-kilter kicks the persistent vocal samples it's not gonna be for everybody it really truly is in wild Footwear isn't as bombastic and as annoying and as gimmicky as like a mainstream EDM song there are difficult challenges with listening to it in that in the moment it can feel like trying to pull off a super complex mathematical equation just off the cuff without a calculator it really is that intense and even though maybe listening to this album from front to back is is not one of the most enjoyable experiences that I've had this decade there are still few genres of electronic music and records like tracks man that still stick out in my mind is like yeah that's that's a really unique sound that's a really kind of special sound that I wish I covered and kind of had put my thoughts out on in a full-length review and the next album I'll talk about in this video is it's pretty much DJ Rashad's rest and peace double cup record who is another artist other producer in the footwork scene or was rather and I regret not covering that record for pretty much the same reasons [Music] next I want to say that I regret not covering little bees God's father mixtape which it took me a little while to realize it after listening to a great deal of his discography and kind of comparing it but this is easily little B's best mixtape I think it's his best mixtape it's my favorite little B mixtape the production on this thing is epic most of his bars and performances on this thing are great too a lot of the bass God's mixtape discography can be kind of spotty and inconsistent or even repetitive and redundant and even though God's father might share some elements of that and it's it's a goddamn long mixtape there's something so magical about this this tape there's something so magical about it's a magical experience it's a magical bass God experience thank you based god thank you based god I wish I reviewed this at the time that it dropped just thank you bass God thank you based god thank you based god thank you based god thank you thank you based god thank you based god thank you based god thank you thank you based god thank you based god thank you based god thank you thank you based god thank basedgod thank you based god thank you thank you based god thank you based god thank you based god thank you thank you based god thank you based god thank you based god thank you thank you based god thank you based god thank you based god thank you thank you based god thank you [Music] next I want to say that I regret not covering as I said I would that knew Autechre sort of 5ll else else SEC five part five our album I said I was gonna I didn't end up making the time for it mostly because it was it was five hours and you know I wish I made that time does that mean you're gonna do the new one it's even longer it's longer than that one you know me maybe no maybe no maybe I'm not gonna maybe I'm not gonna cover that one and finally I want to give a shout-out to the batushka album la la' tour Jia I believe it's pronounced so these guys are a polish metal bands their debut full-length album which kind of rocked the black metal and metal underground collectively with it's amazing compositions epic production and fantastic like chanting vocals which are pretty powerful maybe they lay a little too hard on them sometimes as a bit of a crutch but still this isn't excellently put together black metal album that in many respects feels larger-than-life but still keeps very close connections to the genres blasphemous dark grimy and evil roots and yeah it's just a just a great underground metal black metal rager that that I wish I talked about in in in in in length on the channel and I hope that some of you if you're not aware of some of these albums that you check them out yourselves all the records that I talked about in this video music to hear them is linked down below in the description and that's gonna be it transition have you given these albums listen if you did did you review them unlike me being a dumb-dumb being a dumb dumb dumb head and not reviewing them yeah Anthony antenna over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or

rTb8Kcs89mk,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the brand new let's eat grandma album I'm all ears let's eat grandma is a uk-based music duo consisting of childhood friends Rosa Walton and Jenny Hollingworth they've been making music under the name for about five years now it was in 2016 when they released their debut album I Gemini which was a rough but whimsical art pop album with some experimental psychedelic and funky tendencies some interesting points of reference for the song topics on this album as well like weird inside jokes and there's legit a song on here that's pretty much a narrative twist of the classic Rapunzel fairy tale you might find some stylistic similarities between this record and maybe joanna newsom or the early years of Animal Collective really any number of experimental folk or pop artists who have cropped up since the 2000s but even at this very early stage in their artistic career Jenny and Rosa had a pretty enigmatic sound very otherworldly mystical and pretty but as far as the new LP over here is concerned I'm not sure how much familiarity one might need with that debut album to really kind of get into this because the duo undergoes a pretty significant musical shift on this new project wild Egyptian and I had its share of synths and electronics on it the duo goes full synth pop on this new release over here and they do a pretty good job of keeping in touch with their experimental and progressive roots while delivering some stronger hooks and brighter instrumentals the songs are a lot more direct this time around with a few notable exceptions the songs cool and collected and also Donnie Darko which in my opinion might be two of the weakest songs on the album as well they're also the two longest songs on the album 9 and 11 minutes respectively accounting for over a third of the album's runtime the former is this sprawling electric piece of psychedelic folk rock with very passionate harmonized vocals occasionally some awkward but sparkly guitar work the song tediously builds up to this very dramatic arena sized indie rock finish it's a somewhat flaccid crescendo the instrumental is really to Sanitary to build up the intensity that I think this finish needed for the length at which the song lasts donnie darko is much more lush by comparison much more instrumentation density and since there are lots of dancey chords played throughout the track pulsating percussion eventually the duo introduces this dense maximal wall of instrumentation that sounds like it's been pulled out of a Dan Deacon composition but with some very confident spoken word vocals that kind of finish the track off in a very epic fashion there's some great moments on this track and generally I wouldn't say either of these two songs are awful I just think they could have made their intended point in a much shorter span of time also I feel like these two songs are indicative of this album's overall lack of stylistic focus because musically and conceptually this album is just so all over the place and not in the best way the song Ava coming completely out of nowhere is like one of those sparse super Frank piano ballads that's incredibly assuring essentially telling the listener it's all going to be okay you'll get through it the song snakes and ladders is a heart-wrenching guitar ballad in three four the initial moments kind of sound like a dejected 90s sad sack rock tune but eventually the track grows into this trippy synthetic flourish with clanging bells and lots of thick distortion I loved the linear progression of the track it's got a great pace and overall it's it's one of the few songs on here that feels like it has a direct stylistic connection to the material that let's see Graham I used to release because a lot of the other songs on this album feel less like they're in that experimental psychedelic folk vein and instead are geared toward I don't know like a churches or an m83 fan the reserve but emotionally shaking lead vocals and the driving dance beats and the piano intervals on the track I'll be waiting the sound like lovers of purity ring would really be into them too but while let's eat grandma shares quite a few similarities on this record with the duo's and trios and Quattro's of modern synth pop acts I do think they approach this trend this genre with better production more interesting instrumental layers better tunes better vocals they're not quite as soulless and squeaky clean the song it's not just me and falling into me are in a similar synth pop vein that song and our equally good catchy and sweet the problem is the great ideas on this record don't seem like they have a lot of overall focus as an album for example take the song whitewater the intro to the album immaculately produce love the synths on this track love the strings worked into the instrumental - it is a gargantuan start to this record it sounds like a big-budget soundtrack chunk for a huge sci-fi movie but the tone of this track does not really match that of any other song on this thing again amazing intro feels intergalactic but what it adds to the tone or the theme if there is one of the album in general I have no idea the song hot-pink another track on here that I love super zany cutting-edge pop production total banger clearly the beat on this thing is borrowed from or is in direct reference to the PC music camp as a lot of the vocal samples the the bass some of the skittering metallic percussions sample than different pitches throughout the the beat on this thing sounds like it could have been lifted from a Sofie track or a girlfriend of the year track I love the industrial tone of the instrumental the thumping drums the cute synth breakdown and the cheeky hot pink refrain shouted in in - vocals at the same time there's some great songs on this thing there are a lot of great ideas on this thing there are some great production on this thing - the singing is pretty quality as well let's see grandma brings a lot of personality they take a lot of risks - but this album is just so disjointed as a singular listening experience it just feels like miscellany it feels like a hodgepodge of a record even if a lot of the material on here individually in a vacuum sounds very good it just does very little to reinforce itself as an entire record at the end of the day hopefully let's see grandma's next album just has a bit more direction focus and purpose and I'm not necessarily saying that they need to choose between one music style or another and and just kind of go cold turkey on certain sounds or that future releases need to be stylistically black-and-white it would just be better if in the future they found way to kind of make all of these genres and styles live in harmony either on the same song or find a way to effectively segue from one idea to the next and just have it all add up I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantan oh let's see grandma forever 
nDZqxWjRLCU,what stinks I'm not sure okay oh you got to put that thing in the wash you got a wash that thing it's dirty well you wear the same clothes all the time I shower with my clothes on so they stayed clean well that's how I do it hi everyone changing the new smell can out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Denzel Curie album taboo taboo is the newest album from Miami rapper Denzel Curie who was showing great potential earlier this decade with his nostalgic 64 release an album of raw hardcore hip-hop with a lot of dark very cynical lyricism that set him apart from a lot of the other young rappers in his field and even though curry isn't necessarily seen up there with the Kendricks and Drake's of hip hop he has shown himself to have the longevity of a superstar even five years in rap right now is like a lifetime and curry only seems to be getting better and more relevant with each new release you have his sister EP is 32 Zell and planet rims which featured the viral ultimate and incredible track that worked itself into a lot of memes this decade that kind of launched denzel's career to another level and helped him overcome some of the missteps of those eps then there was the incredibly fantastic Imperial dropped in 2016 originally a SoundCloud mixtape kind of one-dimensional with it being banger after banger after banger but Currie still had the technical ability to flow the aggression to make himself stand out in a field of little Ozzie and little yadi copycats not to mention this album sounded even better upon its 2017 reissue making it an official commercial release on loma vista records where curry still finds himself now shoulder-to-shoulder with artists like saint vincent and ghost imperial featured fantastic tracks like ult and nadi had and showed massive improvement in denzel's hook game as a lot of the choruses on this thing we're now sung and incredibly catchy the hype off this release got Denzel a 2016 double XL freshman spot in 2017 he kind of kept fans satisfied with his 13 IP but none of the material on that in my opinion could have prepared us for what Denzel was deliver on taboo again this is the man's new album and it is split up into three acts and across this thing Denzel can be heard upping the ante on the explosive trap flavored hardcore hip-hop that he's known for already and also expanding his talents into more thoughtful lyricism into more melodic and mellow tracks so rather than coming through with like an overarching theme that plays throughout the entire record though the idea of taboos does come up here and there Denzel has structured this album in a different way you have three separate sections of the album that range from four to five tracks each of them feel kind of like their own mini suite reinforcing a similar vibe or mood it's not completely watertight as cuts like sumo at the very end of Act one don't really add up all that much for me the three separate sections of this thing are supposed to represent light gray and dark kind of like the sections of the album are on a spectrum of positivity and negativity I mean you could maybe say that sumo is more confident in braggadocious than some of the songs later on the record but out of context with the record it just kind of feels like a self glorifying trap banger in the vein of ASAP Ferg's trap Lorde with lots of grimy fat bass riffs rumbling their way through the instrumental and is this song somehow lighter than the next tracks Super Saiyan Superman which is technically a part of the second act of the record the song is also a track banger it's not nearly as aggressive it's kind of cloudy somewhat dreamy and is similarly egotistical and and let's rewind it back to the title track the opening track taboo I mean is this not one of the darker tracks on the album as well with curry rapping about somebody who clearly cares about or has feelings for and the struggles this person has gone through even molestation at a very young age the song does kind of have a cautionary refrain warning the listener to pick the right path or they'll lose and he also displays a lot of love and devotion for the person he's rapping about on this track but again I kind of feel like the lightness or darkness of certain songs on this record can kind of be left up to interpretation I'm sure for Denzel all of this adds up from an outsider's perspective I don't know if the three sections of this album are as defined as they could have been I also think the water gets even muddier when you consider that Denzel across this album raps from I guess a few different personalities of his own invention including his own personal self than Denny cascade the black metal terrorists all of which seemed to be a different filter through which Denzel kind of processes different emotions or allows himself to write from a different perspective it does bring a lot of personality to taboo even if the intentions behind adding this dynamic to the record seemed kind of unclear even though the concept of this album didn't reach its full potential I could say two things definitively about this record one that the material generally does get darker and more tortured and more despondent as the album progresses the carefree vibe of cash maniac is a pretty sharp contrast to the blackest balloon and also this album features Curry's best crop of songs yet period and it really is because in comparison with Imperial like there are improvements on all fronts with this album the production the songs the wrapping the guests who might not have the most star power but brought an incredible amount of talent to this thing the intro and title track tab it was a great tone setter for the album features what sounds like some really sparkly guitars some soaring vocal harmonies there's a pretty clear Outkast influence flowing throughout this track but it feels like it's been updated for the trap generation Curry's delivery on this track has only gotten more dynamic and emotive really feeling every bar that's coming out of his mouth it's not quite the kind of monotone and rapid-fire rapping that some people who have been listening to him for a while might be used to up until this point he still pulls it out for some of the faster and more aggressive tracks on here really only using it when it's necessary we also have the surprisingly smooth black balloons which has the super crisp beat that's like a fusion of hip-hop and dance music with this really catchy kick hi-hat snare hi-hat pattern which sits underneath some really wavy enveloping synthesizers and the lyrics on this track are essentially about the dark things in your life or the nasty things in your life kind of haunting you making it impossible for you to get away he represents these burdens with black balloons floating over it is as he brings up issues such as depression and suicide and personally while I've never really been a big goldlink guy his guest verse on this track isn't really that bad it's super compelling a little playful at points and even though I'm not that crazy about the nasally tone of his voice the flow is very unique the song cash maniac is maybe the most positive and feel-good song on the entire record with Denzel finding himself on top of this very dreamy cyntha instrumental it's kind of like a West Coast throwback I could easily hear Dre and Snoop getting back together for some kind of revivalist hit on this cut the lyrics essentially about denzel living his best life in a way making some silly references here and there saying things like that's me and my Lois no Peter Griffin or back at my palace I'm fly like Aladdin serving my fans on my dope cuz they addicts haters met because I'm on top like an addict I will I will just chalk that up to the playful vibe of the song and leave it at that you know while I love the energy level of tracks like sumo and Super Saiyan they're just two cuts that to me don't really read as being that special in the Denzel curry Canon they're really some of the most unoriginal tracks on the album they feel like generic track bangers if anything makes them listenable it is Curry's brutal delivery and his hilarious points of reference by contrast the tracks switch it up is a bit more topical with curry rapping about this emotional binary bipolarism being nice being mean being raw being green being betrayed switching it up changing being inconsistent this is just a smattering of the polarized opposites that Denzel kind of presents on this track and of course it's another moment on the album where the instrumental it's hard the energy level is high the delivery from curry is intense the song man I got it by comparison is much more toned down it's despondent it's spacious it's a song about jealousy and hatred kind of destroying the relationships around him as his life changes as according to the fame that he has attained from the music that he's making maybe the very changes that he was talking about in the previous track switch it up I love the slow dramatic instrumental on this track the plucky and eerie lead melodies that play throughout it there's also a dreamy beats which in the last leg that causes Denzel to rap from a slightly different perspective which is kind of refreshing to the song Sirens feels like a shotgun blast of social commentary with Denzel touching down on everything from Magga to milk carton kids there's also a point where he likens the trauma of living in the u.s. to date rape bringing up things like the lying the gas lighting the poverty the systemic racism the violence jid brings an amazing guest verse on to the song maybe the best guest verse on the entire album the flow is incredible the lyricism is top-notch every year the dude seems to get better and better and I cannot wait for him to drop another commercial project following that track is the amazing clout Cobain which was a lead single from this thing and is a sharp commentary on clout chasing with Denzel saying I don't even know what to feel they don't even know what's real dry tears with a dollar bill I'm out trying to make a mil oh the track says a lot about the current state that viral internet rappers find themselves in we have plenty of recent examples of rappers OD'ing showing that they're really wild and out there that they're super depressed bunk is another example that comes to mind seeing the downward spiral of attention-seeking stunts and drugs that he's kind of caught himself in the middle of it's like he's deteriorating right in front of us on the Internet there's also the nightmarish the blackest balloon on this album in which Denzel feels like he's trapped in a twisted world where nothing makes sense claims that his late brother is calling to him and that his surroundings feel like a horror movie going as far as to say in the song ain't shit changed since little peep died which is something I and many other people have talked about maybe with some people on the outside they have kind of changed their ways and this situation gave them pause but the root causes that sort of brought peep and many others to this fate have not changed at all and for someone like Denzel who's in the industry and dealing with these people face-to-face who are likely making similar decisions stuff has not changed shit is the same the beyond this cut sounds like a fusion between just a trap instrumental in a horror movie soundtrack with some shouty chorus vocals that are kind of blood-curdling like Denzel himself is crying out for help meanwhile the song perks seems a lot like a critique of the culture born out of soundcloud rap right now it slightly reminds me of some of the criticisms someone like Hopson has had of it over the years but Denzel curry actually has the talent and the personality for his criticisms to actually hold weight instrumentally it's yet another banger on the album but denzel is able to keep things interesting with his focus on a topic with his flow is delivery the song vengeance is a pretty decent moment on the album even though the beat isn't really all that crazy to me and the hook is sort of whatever really what the selling point of the track is is that you have some good guest verses from jpg mafia and Zilla comi they have great chemistry on the track breaks things up a little bit and sets the stage for a relatively strong ending with black metal terrorists which adds character to the flow of the album as one of the hardest songs on the entire record finishes things off and one of the mellower songs on the record kicking things off pretty much the inverse of most albums lyrically there are a few moments on this song as there are with others here that might smell I don't know a little too edgy but still is a very nasty ending to the record I do love the calls of finish him at the very start of the song the track finishes with a short instrumental break and the album closes as easily Denzel Curry's best project so far loving this album is pretty easy as nearly every track on it is fantastic I love that Denzel brought stronger hooks on this album brought back the trippy and smoother production from planet shrooms of a really pulled it off this time brought those insane and aggressive flows and deliveries from Imperial but also had the emotional dynamics and the great topical focus of nostalgic 64 but of course all of these things being updated push forward progressed and improved I do think there are a few tracks on here that are maybe a little unoriginal and the concept overall the separate acts of the album didn't really add up for me it's pretty easy to listen through this entire 43 minute album without paying much attention to what actor in which act is starting which one is ending in that respect if Denzel is going to approach his next record with a concept I think it needs to be better fleshed out it needs to be clearer more apparent and more ambitious but even without those elements functioning at a very I level the core material on this album is great the songs are great production great rapping lyricism great and as a result I'm feeling a decent is strong eight on this thing transition have you given this

there you go now you know and let's get into the worst tracks the worst tracks of the week the songs I didn't care too much for but before I get into this that new Tyler and rocky song like dropped recently and and now it's like dis disappeared and I don't know what's up with that I mean I thought it was really good and it's probably still floating around the internet now but again I don't know what's up with that it's kind of concerning I guess but I'm sure I'm sure it's around somewhere and I'm just having a hard time finding it but still though let's get into the tracks I didn't care for too much first let's start off with vic mensa who's already kind of having a hard time this week he's been beefing with 6-9 and calling out DJ academics and I get there's kind of previous history there and they don't like each other and and I think Vic is well within his right to kind of you know say whatever he wants to say on his platform I think he makes a lot of good points and I think he's a person who wants better for hip-hop wants better for American culture but maybe he doesn't quite realize that standing on your soapbox isn't going to isn't going to get us there in a way I think 6:9 slightly embarrassed him this week by taking part in an interview where he literally asked people in a radio station who probably should know this hey can you name a vic mensa song and nobody in the room could name one again sad unfortunate but he's also come out with this new track over here apparently Vic's and I didn't know this his father's from Ghana and he said talking about this song he's always wanted to kind of take his music there and this new track metaphysical while I do kind of like the modern afro beat production on this thing the the beat is actually pretty wild um vixx auto-tune riffing all over the song didn't really do all that much for me I I get that maybe vocally going in this musical direction would have called for it but I don't really know if this style of music is really Vic's strong point but hey you know maybe he'll continue down this road and drop more interesting stuff and in the future in this vein and if he does then you know that'll certainly be cool moving on from there a new chainsmokers track that sounds like absolute trash it's just generic dance-pop with lackluster production moving on from there oh and also I don't know a dime-a-dozen vocalist oh logic one day this new single over here the rapper advertised on his Twitter account saying this one is for people who have a dream and you know logic he can write some pretty nice inspirational songs here and there but this new cut over here essentially sounds like he's on his mmm  and not even like good hardcore old-school Eminem which was just funny and goofy and off-the-wall and charismatic and and over-the-top this is more like late era get a really cleaned groomed up singer on the hook and just have it sound as radio-friendly as possible mmm it's kind of tragic unfortunately usually logic songs have a bit more appeal than this but this just sounds too soulless to really be appealing to anybody who's not listening to music just on the surface level moving out from there this new idols single miraculously I'm not that into it all despite the fact that I love the band's last record have been a fan of a couple of the singles so far but this new track over here just I could see what they were trying to do with it lyrically and conceptually but just the production on this thing the washed out kind of bleeding guitar distortion and tone on this thing is just really really horrendous and doesn't do they're thoughtful they're muscular and they're explosive style any justice in mind bless me in my opinion so I don't know I'm still looking forward to the new record still looking to see where things pan out on the new album but they're they're still a relatively fresh band and and in this situation everything is subject to change you know like you can't expect to band with not that much of a discography to sort of stick to a certain sound and there they're gonna jump around it's to be expected I guess moving on from there this new dj khaled song i feel like since since dj khaled sort of hit it big on snapchat and has kind of renewed his musical career i I feel like his biggest singles are all kind of reaching a point where it's just a painfully obvious and tacky formula and no-brainer is the most obvious of all of them super obnoxious track totally unnecessary and I feel like he's done this song before and he's just kind of making novelty pop rap at this point it's it's like there's no point let's get into the tracks that I thought were met not terrible not amazing but certainly worth pointing out pointing to your attention first this new yg song featuring ASAP Rocky handgun it's it's okay and I'm just not really sure what the appeal of the song is I'm the the weird you know kind of barking mouth noises on the hook is cool but the flow is so stripped back the beat is so stripped back it's not the most lyrical song either of them have been on I just don't know I really just don't know you know yg he used to hop on funkier production used to have catchy or flows better hooks used to go into a song with a topic and idea of something and now it just seems like he's simplifying himself to the point where I don't know he's just another generic trap rapper which before it sort of seemed like he was trying to define himself outside of of that Lane and he had done it successfully he totally had his own sound and he didn't need to try to chase after anybody else's sound to prove himself or prove that he could make it or prove that he had Talent and now it seems like he's just going the exact opposite direction like he started sure while he wasn't the most technically sound or thoughtful rapper on the block he had a sound he had a style he was pretty distinct and now it seems like he's just trying to fade into the crowd and and I really don't know why I mean maybe he thinks that he'll move more albums get more streams this way and maybe he will you know if he does I him all the luck in the world but I'm not really a wowed by it but new album coming out next week I suppose I'll reserve full judgement until I hear the entire record I'm moving on from there thou has put out a new crowbar cover of the song the last dose of course it is done in there typically distorted harsh apocalyptic sludge metalcore style it's not too bad a santi gold has a new track out titled run the road off of a brand new mixtape that dropped this past Friday it is a very raw poppy synth centric take on dancehall and you know it's pretty simple it's pretty straightforward it's not too glitzy or overly done with the hooks or anything it's it's pretty straightforward it's pretty funky it's pretty chill like your vocals the the production again it's it's pretty organic so um I don't know if I'll end up covering the whole thing or not I haven't completely decided yet but definitely want to make you guys aware that there is a new Santigold mixtape out and it's not too bad you know it's it's not too bad a lot of the songs are pretty say me say me and everything not a whole lot of variation across the tracklist but you know it is a nice vibe it is a fun listen and I do think she is one of the unsung heroes of the indie scene unfortunately I don't think her career took off as as much as it as much as it should have but uh that's that's my opinion next metric with dress to suppress you guys might remember that I think was last week of the week before I love the last metric single which sounded like almost like they were trying to take the the the yeah yeah yeahs original sound into a slightly different direction wasn't bad I thought it was a good song I thought it was a good vibe I thought it was a good production good aesthetic this new track over here not quite as dark or edgy though still some pretty moody and Atmospheric and propulsive rock music I don't think the tune is quite as sharp as the last single but still not a bad track and and I think better than a lot of the stuff they've dropped in the past I mean honestly I've never really been that big of a metric fan so it's it's actually kind of refreshing to hear them dropping some stuff that's actually grabbing my attention and next Mac Miller with what's the use Mac drops a new single that is sort of in a moody lowdown synth funk pop vein and of course the singing is incredibly weak the tune is okay but hey the beat is pretty solid if you know if you're an artist like Dame funk or something like that you'll probably appreciate the instrumental here a lot but I don't know just not that into the tune though it is not quite as underwhelming or I guess leaving me high and dry as some of the stuff from his last song album so I'll say that much I'm moving out from there DJ Darrell and migos come together with quite possibly one of the most generic migos oh well actually I don't not in a long time I guess they just dropped an entire album of generic songs like not too long ago so yeah it's it's okay it just kind of sounds like a Mego song it's not terrible it's listenable let's see if it's if it's hot this summer I guess and Dane Funk I guess has a new EP coming out soon and has dropped this new song over here titled in the city which sort of sounds like I don't know a super pristine perfect computer run future where we live in a utopia or something it's not quite as nocturnal or funky as Dames usual stuff you know I can't say it blew me away either it sort of sounded like something that the vaporwave community would totally get off on so if you want to hear this one of a kind of artists try to create something in that vein I mean go for it give it a shot it's one of many tracks we have linked down there in the description box remember all the songs we talked about in the weekly track roundup we link them down there all right and let's get into the tracks I thought were the best this week the tracks that really wowed me where are we going ooh this new a smoked perp and little pumptrack nephew it's a Bubba banger I kind of love the flows that purp and pump approach this track with not quite as over-the-top as previous stuff it's kind of I don't it's got this weirdly awkward intimate sort of vibe to it that I think is pretty cool yeah it's just kind of a different angle for them and I think it's fun I think it's fun it's you know it's kind of nice to hear purp dropping more solid singles as of late because I think some of his material since dead stars has been kind of lackluster next pond this is the first song from pond in a while that has really kind of grabbed my attention blew me away their last full-length record just kind of felt like a very weak and uninteresting venture into the whole hypnagogic pop feel that sort of sounded just like a bad aerial pink impression and while some elements of that genre remained on this new single over here also elements of progressive rock and progressive electronic and in synth music - and this track is eight minutes long so it's like a multi-faceted monster again did not expect the band to go in this direction at all but it is a really compelling an epic fusion of synth and psyche and prog and nostalgia - it's it's insane you know but also has some experimental elements as well that kind of keeps it contemporary so kudos to Pond didn't know they could pull this sort of thing off but they did next feeling this new song from I believe it's pronounced a Neal Canaan I might be pronouncing that wrong but a new record via ghostly international this new song January's end kind of struck me as I don't know kind of Radiohead influenced like this could easily have been tinkered instrumental that may be a Thom Yorke could have pulled together or like you know might have been on King of Limbs or something but it's way more I guess I'll say nuanced and has a more interesting progression and everything it's it's a very quaint instrumental but there's like an eerie kind of stillness and beauty to it too as well you know it's it's not very grimy or distorted or it doesn't feel very organic either it's very calculated and feels very pristine in a somewhat I guess alien or kind of futuristic way again January's end is the title of the song and it's a pretty little composition moving on from there next shout out to brain feeder Records who have a project on the wave this this person named it durian concept Jay Byers if you're into the brain feeder sound but Wanek here and of want to hear it pushed in in a I guess a little more forward and with some dense and insane production do not miss out on this track and Charli XCX has a new single out titled girls night out which is in her usual wheelhouse you know I feel like charlie is at a point where she has established her new sound she's sticking with it and there are some tracks recently where the lyrics or the production not quite as eccentric but she kind of holds to that whole electro-pop genre however this track is a moment where I think she gets a little bit sassier a little bit weirder a little bit stranger obviously with the title of the song it's all about girls night out no boys no boys the beat is in her you know typical PC music style as of late the vocals are again a little bit more playful and sassy than they would have been on her past few singles and it's just got a kind of I guess a playful you know topic and everything I love the personality I love the charisma and I kind of love the you know the the I guess pro-woman message of the song and I know the female solidarity I guess if you can get interpret is that next Brock Hampton don't be famous if you're aware or if you're not aware I want to make you aware the Brock Hampton recently I guess in preparation for the new album and everything you know they have a beats one show and on the show you know they play tracks they like but they also play like deep cuts and and obscurities and unreleased stuff too and this song over here don't be famous is a total bang or amazing kick off on the song from Merlyn who absolutely kills it on the track the beat is crazy rumors that I've been reading say that this could have been like from a scrap project won't necessarily be on on the new album and everything and also want to shout out the 1997 Diana track and that dropped recently the shortest and most hard-hitting track of this new round of singles pretty much everyone on the song kills it insane beat Matt is especially surprising on the new song I think it's one of his best verses and performances yet and I'm going to leave it at that I think oh wait we have one more who are we shouting out here oh oh oh oh oh how can I forget that how could I forget this I'm talking here about this will be the last song there's a new blood orange track that I wanted to shout out charcoal baby if you guys have been following my reviews for a while you know that I've never really been a huge blood orange fan like I've always felt like there was something in blood oranges music or like the creation of it was purely for just really just aesthetic and lyrically and conceptually and everything it just felt very Hollow and there wasn't really much to it beyond sounding like kind of super shiny nostalgic synth pop with with kind of an R&B twist to it but now this new song over here again charcoal baby is an amazing like fusion of synth funk and soul and the topic of the song - it's an epic man it's an epic and the vocals are gorgeous like I've never thought the vocals on blood oranges music have have been quite as beautiful as they've been on this cut over here and this is actually got me legitimately excited to the point where I feel like this could really be blood oranges year I mean I know that there are a lot of mainstream artists out there that heavy with with blood orange and and work with him on music and and that sort of thing but I feel like this could be a project that really kind of launches his career a little bit you know more as a solo artist and and gives them a lot more visibility because this song is spectacular and if you can follow up this track with songs that are equally emotional but are a bit more punchy and indirect and will you know hook in people who are you know a little more clueless and just kind of perusing the mainstream music landscape the sound could be a winner a winner winner chicken dinner and I'm gonna leave it at that now that I've made a total ass of myself and have gone full cringe that has been the weekly track round up everybody hopefully hopefully hopefully hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this thing all the tracks we talked about are linked down there in the description below again with our Amazon and turntable lab associate links and also again shout out to the good people over a seat geek whose app is linked down there below in the description box I'll see you guys in the next one cool cool

gKPkQv_aLzY,hi everyone Trinity make itty bitty here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new melodies echo chamber album but bon voyage this is the second full-length album from French singer-songwriter melody pro che under the Melody's echo chamber name a psych pop project that started turning heads on the internet about six years ago with a decent self-titled debut album that was produced by melodies then partner Kevin Parker of tame impala Fame I can't really say I cared that much for the album myself though I saw the incredibly blissful and sublime sound that it was shooting for but mostly to me the album just came off really washed out and one-dimensional like much of the dreamy psych pop geared toward the indie scene these days now I was pretty sad to hear last year that melody suffered a horrible accident that essentially put her music career on hold so this album is pretty long-awaited as melody has been dropping tracks from it for the past several years going all the way back to 2014 with the track shrim and it's only a 7 track album so hearing four tracks from it already is is really a lot to reveal going into a new record however I wouldn't really say that that spoiled the incredible amount of fun that I had listening to this thing the sound of bon voyage might not be as trendy or as hazy as Melody's previous album but the production and the songs on this thing are far more layered intricate and adventurous this time around it's an interesting record that somehow straddles the the classic roots of sixty psych pop while also pushing the genre into the future it's just kind of a shame that it lasts 33 minutes a great deal of the magic on this record comes down to the production that melody drums up with her collaborators Friedrich Swan and Rena Fisk the tunes on this thing are lavishly arranged with harmonized vocals and strings also interesting guitar tones what sounds like samples here and their sequence drum beats even a trap beat or two honest to god very warm clunky bass lines that sound like they're lifted out of a Beatles record glossy synthesizers that sound like they're lifted out of an 80s record crazy instrumental shifts melody and her collaborators on this record really you come off as like musical chameleons and of course there is Melody's very breathy Frenchie vocal delivery that kind of is at the helm of all of it the sound and the versatility of some of the songs on this record is incredible how many crazy captivating and also coherent musical passages fly by on the lengthier songs here is really a creative feat it's the kind of instrumental detail of psyche pop bands used to work into their records 50 years ago after they hold themselves up in the studio for five to six months on end but now with digital recording technology melody can kind of go on to even stranger musical excursions the entire record here opens up with the beautiful psyche ballad cross my heart the strings are lovely again the bass has a bit of a throwback vibe the vocals are enchanting then there's this weird sudden beatbox hip-hop instrumental break that somehow works a jazzy flute solo angelic group vocals it's like I've suddenly been transported into an entirely different genre an entirely different world and it's a feat that this new contemporary funkier sound palette is able to work with The Ballad earlier in the track as the two sounds kind of coalesced later into the song there's also a pretty powerful and climactic ending to this cut as well with lots of heavy strings thrown on it has a very cinematic vibe the song desert horse is another powerhouse moment on the album in my opinion it's a mystical experimental envelope-pushing trip with lots of desert rock grooves what sounds like maybe a Middle Eastern string sample or something also auto-tuned singing on this cut and some vocal freak-outs reminiscent of Yoko Ono there's also a track beat breakdown on this cut set against a soaring guitar solo that again it somehow works it goes over much better than one might assume and I'm gonna butcher the title of this next one but Quan lalar may Dena JH font dancer Laneige yeah this cut sort of sounds like a challenge to borrow some of the funkier and more bubbly elements from an unknown Mortal orchestra production you know that sweet lo-fi psych sound but kind of build it out into something a bit more ambitious you have the groovy drums you have the claustrophobic super-close super whispered lead vocals but then all of a sudden the track shifts into these futuristic synth arpeggios as the song goes forward you get yet another overwhelming kaleidoscopic trippy finish that sees all the instrumentation building higher and higher it's bleeding into itself it's getting all swirly the song vision of someone special is not nearly as gargantuan as some of the other cuts here but it's still a pretty sweet song of longing sung in a mix of French and English there is more progressive electronic synth work on this track some plucky string melodies again another moment on the album that shows a real knack for mixing genres and eras and aesthetics in a very creative way in a way that's so harmonious and so functional the amount of ideas going into a single passage on this album might not necessarily hit you right away because it doesn't sound like a huge clash now listen there are some great ideas on here legitimately some of the freshest ideas coming out of neo psyche right now but overall the album is kind of scant and unfocused it has a very odd awkward flow and it's pretty clear that the material on this thing collectively was sort of cobbled together to make this pretty short release the record is really lopsided and inconsistent because these gargantuan neo psych epics are really where the majority of this album's fireworks happen there are only a few of them to speak of the other tracks sound like they were recorded in and created in a completely separate headspace potentially made under completely different conditions as well I mean tracks like shrim on this thing while they are decent they sound so basic in comparison to like a desert horse which is a site I would love to hear more of for melodies echo chamber in the future I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this thing transition have you

fCL9gKzQrz4,sym assimilation sam-i-am summer summer summer summer sir what are you wearing just just my clothes where are your summer clothes these aren't the only clothes I have it's really sad hi everyone June's new July tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new 88 rising compilation head in the clouds 88 rising is an up-and-coming music brand and label that houses such names as rich Brian and Joe G higher brothers Nicki some of the most significant up-and-comers in the fields of rap and R&B right now over the past few years 88 risings name has been growing and growing and growing with one viral hit after another and seeing the successful transformation of George Miller's career from YouTube troll artists to like moody alternative R&B star and while it seems like each artist under the 88 Rising umbrella is doing pretty good respectively there haven't really been a whole lot of opportunities up until this point to come together as a collective as a group and while the brand is easily one of the hottest commodities out there right now make no mistake that they're still kind of establishing themselves and what better way to do so and potentially grow your audience then by coming out with some kind of focused compilation of simple summer jams because kids are gonna listen to it it's gonna get popular it's gonna get hits it's gonna get plays it's gonna go viral now I heard some tracks from this compilation before it had been released and I was pretty impressed with what I had heard so far Nicki's contributions to these tracks sounded fantastic Joji was really kind of pushing himself outside of his comfort zone on these more upbeat and sugary songs especially on the song peach jam with block boy jb which is easily the most tongue-in-cheek and in flirty song of the bunch here a track that I ended up hearing much later as it was released as a single don't want to create any confusion there so let me say even though I think tracks like midsummer madness are fantastic amazingly catchy I love the [Music] vocal line that Jody brings to the table the acoustic guitar arpeggios that are worked into the track the very sweet beat everything that lyrically rich brian and higher brothers bring to that track I also think the idea of coming out with a compilation like this is great too for getting the 88 rising name out there but still everything about this compilation from the outset says to me hey we're gonna come together with a pretty basic batch of tracks that are groomed to see viral success on a summer Spotify playlist trying to blend in as much as possible with the current popular music sound palette so that we kind of fit in and hopefully gain from some of the wave that everybody else is kind of riding on right now and that is in fact what this compilation pretty much is for better for worse I will say the label and everybody involved with this record does a pretty good job of keeping up a generally summery sound own own but honestly this record doesn't really seem to have a purpose outside of being a vehicle for the ad a rising label to kind of just throw all of these songs at the wall and see what sticks and really here they are trying everything from really slow syrupy comatose alternative R&B at the opening track to a crew remix of famous Dex's Japan and because it kind of seems like they're dipping their toes and everything the results of this record are just kind of mixed there are spots on this thing that boggle my mind like the Niki track war paint which pretty much sounds like a Lana Del Rey song or the song beam which isn't bad but it seems like the only reason it exists is to sound like a playboy party song which rich Brian merely features on another track that makes me feel like the entire purpose of this record is to blend in with current trends and simultaneously I guess kind of compete on that level and if that's what 88 rising is intending to do on this project I would say mission accomplished this sounds like a great deal of everything else that you will hear out there in trap flavored pop rap today but again with maybe a bit more happy-go-lucky upbeat bright shiny summery vibe so if you like your pop rap to be really catchy really saccharine incredibly carefree which I don't think I've heard a more carefree song this year than poolside manner of that synth line on the track though there are some true blue bangers on this thing that I think have great instrumentals wild vocal lines that are super infectious swimming pool is one let it go is another in disrespectin is a third and again all of these songs I could easily see being played on the Spotify playlist and for some people who are listening to say hey play that one again there are points when I think the compilation could have been a lot worse a lot tackier a lot more tasteless not to say they don't cross that line though I think I want in is a prime example of that meanwhile the song nothing wrong with goldlink is really a total mess aesthetically melodically it just doesn't really seem to know what it wants to do with all of the musical and rhythmic clutter worked into its instrumental but that being said don't go into this compilation expecting anything to kind of blow you away go above and beyond or really even be all that intriguing either because at its best I think this compilation is catchy it's cute it's braggadocious it's a little rambunctious it's trying its hardest to have a good time and for the most part I I think I think it does but a great great great deal of what's on this compilation even the high points just kind of feel very fleeting and surface level as a lot of the slow jams and ballads are nowhere near as interesting as the bangers and even they kind of follow a very simple formula again it is pretty cool to hear the usual 88 rising crew and a somewhat different brighter light to hear one of their up-and-coming vocal talents and Nicki get more shine and attention and opportunity and also to hear Joe G grow as a singer I mean the closing track on here is a profoundly emotional moment on the album something that I think was really lacking on a great deal of the previous tracks again all of these individual things are cool but as a whole head in the clouds sounds more like a commercial venture than an artistic one and I say that because I think in the current streaming landscape I don't really see how these songs can't kill it and if the comp is successful hopefully it grows the ad a rising brand more and they have the ability to do something a bit more substantive at some point in the future I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a

O3GBsa1-dKs,ah hi everyone Brittany otoño here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a new review of the new internet album hive mind the Internet the ragtag band of neo soul stirrers that were once merely just an odd future Wolfgang kill them all side dish they're back with their fourth full-length album previously there wasn't really all that much that I could say that was positive about the Internet's music the songs were bland the overly gentle lead vocals of obsidian der whelming to say the least the grooves on these instrumentals were stiffer than a corpse some of the lyrics kind of corny the songs generally their previous LP egodeath did see quite a few improvements on the instrumental front it seemed like having a full band now meant things were funkier groovier just a better sound overall even if some of the songwriting was still pretty weak and honestly the compositional and the instrumental improvements continue on to hive mind initially I was pretty intrigued with the lead singles to drop from this thing tracks like rol Burbank funk which features one of the best bass lines of 2018 hands down a hard grooving drumbeat the song overall sounds like a psychedelic fusion of disco and funk it's also one of the many tracks on this thing where multi-instrumentalist and producer Steve Lacey takes lead vocals then there's the track la-dee-da which has an equally captivating drumbeat with lots of fantastic little rhythmic embellishments a nimble bassline and also one of the first internet tracks I've heard where SIDS voice actually kind of feels emotional her singing on this cut just has a little bit of bite to it and even a little bit more of that for the Internet is a good thing the deeper cuts on this album are better this time around as well generally I think the Internet sound overall has gotten better even if some of the songs on this thing still kind of sound like neo-soul wallpaper however this time around I'll say that the Internet at least brings a pretty pleasant vibe there's not really anything here that I'm hearing that sounds overtly awkward and unlike previous internet albums I think hive mind is actually pretty psychedelic and subtle and substantive even though the sound of this record is on the quieter on the gentler side between the some of the sequence beats the bass the guitar some of the trippy post-production there's quite a bit of a very tiny quiet details to eat up and dive into showing you don't necessarily need to come off strong to make something engaging the opener come together sounds like quiet funk soul revolution the lyrics of the song might be autobiographical I don't know but I kind of read it as a message to a lost confused generation that eventually finds its way through collective consciousness of its struggles the song stay the night is incredibly nocturnal and sexy another great baseline a surprising vocal from CID that manages to actually come off as seductive I'm also digging the extra quirky production that sort of thrown in to kind of break up the drumbeat and the sparkly acoustic guitar soaked in reverb on this thing - I love the funky off-kilter be on Bravo it has these gunshots snares that hit hard they're kind of abrasive the bass line on this cut is much slinky er than it is on other songs it's kind of a nice change of pace from some of the other instrumentals here the bass line as well as much slinky er than is on other tracks generally the instrumental is a nice change of pace from a lot of the others here definitely a show of how much more creative and bouncy the Internet's sound has gotten even if the tune on this track and the following one - are a little sleepy and again that remains to be an issue with the Internet there are still some songs there are still some tunes on this record that managed to come off a little repetitive kind of like motifs that are extended out merely to just keep the vibe or the groove of the song up the internet does continue to experiment with song structure though with tracks that function in multiple parts or different beats which ups and transitions like on the song next time slash humble pie the internet used to do stuff like this on their previous records but I actually think they're pulling it off much better on this new album over here as the segue on this track and a few others are pretty good in the contrast of ideas as sharp and exciting there's even what sounds like a pretty sweet key change on the track look what you've started I love the balladry and the encouraging and inspiring message on the track it gets better with time with some wonderfully assuring vocals and lyrics from Sid there's also a rap verse at one point in the song that kind of backs this message up from the one and only big rube whose voice was so familiar to me at the time that I heard I was like god I've heard this who is this guy and I didn't put two and two together I didn't realize who it was until I saw the outcast connection when I was reminding myself of who he was I think some of the final moments of this record certainly could have been better the tracks wannabe and hold on to me feel kind of like tedious motifs again while they're not bad while they're on melodically and lyrically and structurally they don't really say as much to me as a it gets better with time or any other song on here that just seems to be built out a little bit better beat goes on is a track where I love the respective parts of the song that kind of go into it but it does feature one of the weirder transitions on the entire album as the whole band just sort of seems to go completely silent for an odd amount of time before they just kind of break into an entirely different musical passage again the grooves in both sections are great I love the jazz influences that turn up on this track to the bustling rhythms and the trippy vocal harmonies are excellent this is definitely one of a lot of moments on this record that I can point to and say the Internet has gotten so much bolder since their first second and third release for the Internet this is easily their most well written well recorded performed and mature album so far they are in arguably sounding better as a band as a unit as a collective and all the weird and awkward kinks that were so obviously there on their previous releases have kind of evaporated while this album isn't exactly the loud bold and brave release that I was hoping for I'd argue that the Internet has kind of come into their own on this record the subtlety and the sensuality that they've clearly been shooting for all along I'd say has been achieved the guitar drum and bass work on this thing is a lot smarter giving Steve Lacey more vocal parts on this record to kind of break up the vocal monotony of previous records it was a great idea I also hear Sid kind of pushing herself out of her vocal comfort zone I'm not blown away by this thing but I am happy with it and looking forward to seeing more improvements in the future I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a comment in the comments if you're feeling full it's over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana the internet a hive mind forever 
exmYWItj-YY,Oh hi everyone dead no heater the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new bus driver album electricity is on our side one of hip-hop's most idiosyncratic voices Reagan Farquhar aka bus driver is back four years after releasing his very fantastic record perfect hair and album that marked yet another artistic high point in his ever-expanding discography a futuristic and bold release loaded with mind-bending flows instrumentals and lyricism after about 20 years of innovative highs and far-fetched lows from Reagan the only thing I've really come to expect from bus driver is I do not know what to expect and electricity is on our side is easily one of his biggest and most surprising records yet standing at 23 tracks about 80 minutes of material and while jazz has always been a huge artistic reference point in reagan's music this album is maybe his most indebted to the genre with multiple tracks on here featuring him just spitting over straight jazz instrumentals in a way sounding kind of reminiscent like old West Coast jazz rap outfits like free style fellowship now anyone who has heard a bus driver album before this knows that the rapping on this record is going to be a truly unique experience as Reagan pretty much has the rhythmic and melodic sensibilities of a bebop saxophonist which seems to be even more so the case with some of the instrumental backdrops he places himself on here especially on the track right before the miracle where Reagan is pretty much singing and rapping in syncopation with a saxophone lead hitched on a very metropolitan piece of jazz fusion but as impressive and as unique as bus driver style continues to be on this album there are quite a few spots on this record where vocally he just seems to falter there is generally more singing from Reagan on this new album which as shown on previous releases like bows and arrows can be kind of a downside as drivers very strained and off-key lead vocals don't don't do too well in large doses even with a jazzier backdrop even with to non exploding slowly even pitch shifted on losing you again and even with guest singers on I bin there again I dig drivers singing in small doses and on perfect hair I thought his singing had actually improved but nearly 80 minutes of driver just stretching and contorting his vocal cords straight into an almost tone-deaf mess it's just not as experimental bold or unique as this record seems to think or at least is heavily implied on numerous bars and the track this is my art and it is dangerous despite not being head over heels for this album I do think there are quite a few highlights I love the disjointed lo-fi hiphop stylings of the tracks in originality the sleepy warp beat on this thing is gorgeous and pairs really well with drivers disjointed mosaic of personal connections and references and experiences the very psychedelic and woozy the saboteurs mirror also an excellent cut the art rat banger the year I became a motherfucking G is certainly a highlight to also the speedy kiss around the note is an excellent moment on here one of the most intense jazz instrumentals on the entire record and I love how driver kind of uses this as an opportunity to really kind of push the limits of his flow also excellent is the haunting to the top of the divorcees list of Baroness Nika which sounds like a total nightmare like an abstract hip-hop Twilight Zone I love the way that driver kind of plays off of the very odd womanly vocal sample on that cut certainly leaves a very strong impression but for every cut on here that I thought was great there are at least a few moments that absolutely make me groan like on the improvisers anthem where bus driver seems to take great pride in the idea that he's just kind of winging it despite the opening bars being met this girl named Suzie Q I said how do you do I'm driver I'm cruisin through I'm difficult like a Rubik's Cube let's find something new to do this is like Joyner Lucas levels of corny I feel like there are so many spots of this record that could have just been left on the cutting room floor and the album just would have been better for it mostly the entire last third of the album the closing tract I think is is salvageable if it were to be touched up and reoriented as some of the singing on there is kind of rough but I do love the large antenna k-- choral line that driver pulls together on that track kind of seems like a I don't know hip hop's attempt at trying to create one of these grand triumphant millennial ballads also the track fucking is pretty hard-hitting as well I mean listen I could pick all day through the junkyard of ideas that driver has presented on this album a lot of which are pretty cool complex abstract fringe but half of the time this record just kind of sounds like the unedited ramblings of someone who went into this project with very little in the way of artistic inhibitions again see Suzy Q how do you do which is not even the only questionable bar on the album you know sometimes a great album isn't just about what you can blurt out but how you can edit it and organize it and agreement to be something that is really potent and hard-hitting so your artistic vision kind of translates and doesn't get lost in the clutter in the case of this album I think that absolutely could have happened but unfortunately electricity is just really bloated lost in the woods and strangely convinced of its own depth despite feeling like it's falling into some really obvious artistic fallacies most of which center around assuming that making music that's weird or difficult or abstract is somehow automatically good or interesting or entertaining when really a lot of the material on this album doesn't even sound that alien for bus driver I mean even though this thing is on the longer side I think bows and arrows by comparison is a much more surprising release as ambitious as this album might seem on the surface because of its length it's pretty much just a less prepared version of the enigmatic rapper we've been listening to up until this point I'm sure there are some hardcore fans that will find listening to him in such an unfiltered capacity kind of exciting or inspiring I don't know I didn't even really get the sense listening to this album that I was somehow getting a veil pulled back or something like that or I was listening to the cutting room floor like some real kind of raw out-there stuff I'm feeling a decent too strong 5 on this thing

gmGaEVWYiJo,boy boy boy boy hi everyone boy any Boitano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Dirty Projectors album lamp-lit pros the indian art pop outfit Dirty Projectors they are back once again obviously with singer and songwriter and multi-instrumentalist David long strength at the helm he's kind of gotten the band back together though on this new record not quite the the solo venture that the last self-titled record from Dirty Projectors was the project has undergone quite a bit of evolution since its inception in the early 2000s in the group's back catalogue our very experimental and progressive lo-fi Indian art rock records like glad fact and rise above ventures and to chamber pops such as slaves graves and ballads we also have the landmark indie pop record bit to Orca the strangely strip back swing low magellan which led to the group's crumble kind of bringing us simply down to David who then took Dirty Projectors into that weird one-off solo alternative R&B venture that dropped last year but now as I said with this new record over here a band for Dirty Projectors is back together maybe not the band but a band and it sounds like with this one David is finally starting to pick up where records like Orko left off but also continuing Dirty Projectors usual trend of evolution on this record you will find a lot of whimsical and angular indie pop with sweet melodies fed through a recording that is endearingly rough most of the time David's usual songwriting style makes a comeback on this record which should be pretty familiar to anybody who's been listening to Dirty Projectors for a while as it is pretty idiosyncratic and while it is cool to hear Dirty Projectors back on their old stomping grounds in a sense the results of this album are still pretty mixed even if I am enjoying how David has kind of worked in some of the sequence beats and electronic from the last Dirty Projectors album into the group's usual sound there are quite a few highlights on the record like the opener right now featuring Sid of the internet Fame which kicks off with some very pretty sparkly guitar work David singing about what sounds like some kind of desolate apocalyptic world there are lots of honking horn hits on this thing fuzzy synth leads some odd Polly rhythms - and even though the lyrics on this track read is being very desolate and dreary there's almost like a note of personal inspiration coming through on the song - Sid's very polite and sweet voice works really well into the track to her and a league of other guest singers on the record kind of replaced the typically chirpy background vocals that one might find on an older Dirty Projectors album love the tune on this track love the blend of pop and soul and also loving Dirty Projectors still having the knack for making some very beautiful but captivating and oddly shaped melodies and rhythms the song that's a life style is most likely my favorite track on the entire record features more very rich and slick guitar work one of the sharpest hooks on the record some of the smartest lyrics who will stop wasting the lives of the brave based on a lie who will stop wasting the forests and seas we know that we'll survive who will stop wasting the time who will stop putting pratas upon our eyes who will not place themselves higher than wait for a senator's prize a lot of lying cheating and dishonesty being displayed throughout the track a pretty social and political angle Dirty Projectors very clearly trying to fry some big fish on this one the track builds up elegantly with these beautiful harmonized background vocals a swaying drumbeat and some very shouty calls and responses the lead vocal on the hook is fantastic the lyrics are super dark and disturbing and yet the melody David sings here is one of the most beautiful on the entire record when Ahmad States yeah I love the song Bluebird a very dreamy and slightly psychedelic ballad there are some subtle beats on this cut tuning woodwinds watery electric pianos it's a pretty little sound palette some kind of double a's in the in the mix too I love the gentle vocals on this track the adorable and kind of lovesick lyrics you and me me and you something sweet something new fresh and clean like the beginning I love the lyrics on this track about a fresh start a new love which is actually a theme running throughout most of the songs on this album I don't exactly know what the catalyst for that is who the muse for this album was but whoever it is that person seems to have left a very large impression on on David as he seems to be singing about pretty much the same love and devotion on the track what is the time on the song you're the one to which is a beautiful 60s folk ballad throwback featuring Robin Peck Knoll the Fleet Foxes Fame doing some background vocals if I'm being honest I love about half of the album here the rest of the record though feels kind of underwhelming or maybe even grading for a variety of different reasons while I do appreciate a lot of the lovey-dovey lyrics on this record I feel like the song breakthrough might be trying just a little too hard with its references to keeping it 100 and Julian Casablancas it's kind of like contemporary corny I don't know also I cannot stand some of the instrumentation and the mix on this track like there are these really distorted horrid revving synthesizers playing throughout much of the track that honestly if they weren't there the track would have been improved greatly there's also the very funky I feel energy the gentrify blend of pop funk and soul on this track sounds like a cake instrumental I might mean that in the best way possible I really don't know at this point all I know is that some of the vocal mixing on this track Falls kind of flat and yeah I'm just not really that much into the tune zombie conquer featuring some background vocals from Empress of has some very good intentions and great ambitions but I think the slightly rough recording of this cut sucks the potential oomph out of the song a lot especially as the very flattened flaccid drums and guitars try to hammer away on like these syncopated patterns and riffs that kind of sound the same way that cheap fireworks look again I thought Empress of this background vocals were were great I thought the very angular guitar work on the track was amazing Davis vocals were pretty decent to but yeah the track just does not have the the push or again the the girth that I think a song was trying to sound this heavy should the song I found in you was another cut that to me just felt like a lot of squandered potential because of a kind of muddy uninteresting mix the closing track on here tries to deliver like this very slow lavish fusion of chamber pop and vocal jazz with a super hushed lead vocal from David that is a very underwhelming very lackluster I feel like if you really wanted to deliver this track he could have gone above and beyond vocally like he really could have spotlit his own voice and really let it all out there but instead he kind of just lets the background instrumentation the horns take the the reins even though they're not playing that boldly anyway they merely sound like accompanying instrumentation for a stronger bolder vocal you know while there is a lot of this record that I came to enjoy even though I went into it with a lot of reservations I still feel like as far as the quality of the songwriting and the sound of these songs go it's it's very much a mixed bag it's it's inconsistent it's certainly cool to hear Dirty Projectors kind of delivering a sound that is a is a little more familiar to longtime fans but I feel like that's all the more reason for the the songs and the sound of them to be great because this is your usual territory over here you should be killing it this is not some weird one-off experiment that could have gone really badly and if you were to take a handful of the best tracks on this album out of the equation that's easily what it could have been I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition

KBZFrj58M0I,hey hey hey everyone you know who it is it's Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and it is let's see July 22nd 2018 time for another weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week this episode is of course sponsored once again by the good people over at Ridge wallet they make these nifty little strapped minimalist

want to go down there and treat yourself to some colorful pressings of records or audiophile equipment and stuff with a turntable lab we get kickback from it and first I want to shout out the new offspring and 311 tracks the bands are going out on tour with one another and they have released covers of one another songs down and self-esteem self-esteem actually I mean I know it was a hit but still underrated offspring song I feel like a lot of people sort of remember them more for the pretty fly for a white guy shed and and that sort of thing and I understand why but self-esteem was was really one of their they're better tracks back in the day but yeah they covered one another track one another's tracks I guess there's gonna be a limited edition 7-inch out there for those who are interested in in such things okay let's get into what I felt were the worst tracks of the week let's do it first there's new track from the band Jeff the Brotherhood it's titled parachute and yeah it's really just kind of a bland neo psychedelic mess I mean I appreciate that the band really needed to change they needed to do something different their sound previously was just kind of a super uninteresting grunge revivalist garage rock revivalist deal and you know some of the tunes and some of the riffs were kind of catchy but outside of that it was just kind of boring but now it seems like they've gained even less personality in this stylistic shift and I'm just not really seeing the appeal of the direction here sadly moving out from their Death Cab for Cutie I dreamt we spoke again the production on this track is downright tacky and cheap Ben Gibbard sounds like he's singing out of a McDonald's drive-through box I have no idea why and the tune itself makes me sad and nostalgic for the old days of Death Cab so yeah alright moving on from there a CRO LevelUp Jesus Christ the lyrics on the hook of the song wow my absolute trash the level up level up level up and the did listen listen to it yourself and try not to laugh try not to laugh at just how half-assed the lyrics are on this Jesus Christ kill me alright moving on from there Animal Collective with a new track title the haircutter which apparently is supposed to be attached to this forthcoming very long audio-visual soundtrack e-type project that they have coming out which which doesn't even involve all members of the band from what I understand yeah it just sort of sounds like a very drab uneventful drone it was hoping for a bit more meat on the bone or something but yeah it's it's really just kind of a flavorless drone in my opinion didn't didn't really do too much for me so yeah I don't know if I'm really looking forward to this project I'm sure I'll talk about it to some degree once it's finally out but oh and here is a the new song from Takashi 69 featuring Nicki Minaj yeah it's an auto crooner it's an autocrine banger Takashi sounds absolutely awful on tract as he is singing for most of it and his voice sounds so goofy when he's not screaming at the top of his lungs and so he's sort of singing in a sort of normal tone of voice and his voice is cracking it sounds really awful and I didn't know Nicki Minaj was this desperate honestly like is Ishi this hard up for her fans and attention and plays and and and all that that she has to do a track with Takashi six nine I guess I guess she is or else she wouldn't be doing the track which is unfortunate but yeah it's it's absolute trash so [Music] let's get into the tracks I just thought were kind of meh you know not not terrible didn't blow me away but we're certainly worth mentioning pointing out to your attention let's go this new wild noting song indigo kind of the same dream pop aesthetic that you get of most recent wild nothing tracks although I'll say the the instrumental and the groove of this track sounds a little bit more sensual than usual a little bit more like baby-making music if if making babies to very pastel dream pop is your thing I guess The Prodigy have announced a new album thank God you know they're actually still pretty cool the last record was a little all over the place though did really fuck with that ass Leaford mods feature on there however neat someone is the title of the track kind of sounds like a mix between their their usual breakbeat punk fusion but then on top of it there's like a bit of an industrial touch and then something that kind of sounds like you know just a you know a mid 2010s like dubstep banger but just a little bit edgier it's pretty cool it's pretty cool like I feel like some of the production sounded sort of tacky but it's it's cool it's a cool track moving on from there with a 1975 loved it if we made it a lot of people ask me about this track and quite a few headlines about it too because of the lire what's being said in the lyrics of this track the 1975 not usually known as a band that that addresses political issues social issues or a really kind of addressed as much of anything that's contemporary in their lyrics so like many pop rock bands their songs lyrically tend to be very general just about very general I guess universal topics without a whole lot of contemporary specifics I guess however this song is talking about Trump racism rest in peace to little peep so on and so forth it's like a little bit of a you know an updated 2018 version of we did it's like you know a whole amalgamation of contemporary touchstones and and then mixed in there is some very obvious critique at the information age sort of failing us modernity kind of failing us kind of being born into and growing up in a really shitty and subpar society you know I'm not sure if again this is like kind of the best direction for the band to go in but I liked the the track lyrically and conceptually instrumentally I didn't really mind it either it kind of sounded like a bit of a 80s pop rock throwback but with some more contemporary production thrown in there if there's one thing that kind of bugged me about the cut overall it's that I thought that the the vocal melody was super tedious and the singing was very yell P and kind of annoying and grated on me after a while but I don't know this is this is actually the most the 1975 has ever peaked my interest and attention so fuck yeah let's let's keep it going I guess I guess I'll be looking out for the next the next track the next single and I imagine a new record on the way this year alright moving on from there gorillas toss has a new track out titled meteorological and it's actually a pretty cool cut it didn't really kind of hit as hard as some of the funkier post-punk e'er stuff from their last record that dropped on DFA records that I gave a very positive review to this new cut over here goes into more of psychedelic direction I still think those elements of punk music and dance music are pretty pivotal and pretty key to this new song over here but psych poppin and psychedelic music in general seems like a much greater influence overall I thought that the instrumental and the song was just kind of a little sloppy as a results of maybe this stylistic change but still I thought it was a decent cut and still I'm intrigued and an interest piqued on a new gorilla toss record for sure moving on from there chance the rapper with 65 and Ingleside which is one of the four tracks that the Chicago rapper singer-songwriter dropped this week I just didn't really care for this one as much as the other three which you will see are in the best section because I thought some of his vocalizations and and singing on the track are really annoying and obnoxious and moving on from there we have Alex que Redfern and the seizures with the hole which is a pretty gnarly piece of accordion rock if if I've picked that instrument out correctly it's pretty dark and sinister very surly song but a you already see the the album rather the cover art over here I'll say the the accordion rock is is as gruesome and and nasty as I guess the the depiction on the front cover over here it's it's pretty neat you know maybe a little campy maybe a little hokey but still a pretty interesting listen alright let's get into the tracks I thought were the best this week best tracks this week enjoyed another lemon twigs song not quite as eccentric or theatrical as the last single that I reviewed from them but to small victories still a pretty cool little psych pop track moving on from there lo has a new set of songs out which I don't want to get incorrect what the heck was it oh it's it's it's like this triptych it's this triptych of songs and it's three tracks from their forthcoming album which tripped yes it's called the double negative chip tick and it's three songs from their forthcoming album all kind of mixed together in a single music video that lasts 14 minutes and low in my opinion they're a great long-running indie rock and slow core band and for a while now for the better part of this decade really they've they very much been in need of kind of a change and update a something and I feel like what they present on this new material is in fact a change but they also kind of stay in their usual wheelhouse of just making very quiet subtle music but the change this time around the sounds are so much more shoegaze II the musical tone is much more eerie and strange and alien it's almost ambient at points something like kind of a experimental eerie ambient pop blend it's it's hard to explain and and I like that about it you know it feels otherworldly it feels mystical again it feels I'll say eerie again because it is sort of like chill inducing and it is hauntingly beautiful as is one more thing I'll say about this three this collection of three tracks three separate movements on this thing generally again pretty cool I thought it was pretty cool so it's it's been a while since I've like legit been looking forward pretty hard to a new low album and this new record of theirs is gonna be coming out in September I believe so next one next one this new track didn't actually just come straight from me it actually came from Austin suggested this one to drop last week but I missed it psychedelic and jazz and experimental music artist Lonnie Holley has a new song entitled I woke up a new record on the way at some point and it's a very political deeply political track about waking up in a fucked up America these Howlin gargling very dark aged vocals that are pretty uh pretty nuts and some great kind of disjointed and visceral jazz instrumentation hanging in the background yeah it's a very intense listen you know if you're like a Gil Scott here in fan or something like that I think you'll definitely get into what Lonnie is delivering on this thing I thought it was pretty cool I thought it was a great political and sort of artistic statement and I enjoyed generally the musical element of two so it's pretty blunt in in a lot of respects but I think brings a pretty strong message home and is just pretty bold look all around moving on from there Joyce Manor has a new track out that I enjoyed quite a bit million dollars to kill me it's a bit of a kind of a 90s pop rock throwback you know all rock throwback but it's a good song it's a good hook it's a great vibe good production so uh yeah definitely looking forward to this new Joyce Manor next this is the latest track from Joe G and black boy JB which is off the the new 88 rising music compilation where they're just pretty much doing like summer jams on this thing yeah it's a pretty fun track I can't say if there's a too much about it that I think is going to last pass to the summer but I do think it's incredibly catchy I think black boy actually shows a bit more versatility than I would have expected from him like he's actually kind of funny on the track Joe G has a bit more of vocal versatility than he has shown on his own separate EPS where the music tends to be a lot more dark and moody whereas this song by comparison is much more upbeat and sort of silly I think it's smart with the the group is doing the label is doing on this collection of tracks because you know they've got to find a way to connect in with the kids there are a lot of outlets in the hip-hop community that don't necessarily want to cater to them or put them on and I feel like making summer music for the audience of kids who are most likely going to be fans of the ad a rising label is probably one of the best ways to circumvent a lot of the outlets and publications that aren't really fucking with them aren't really endorsing with them so so yeah I thought it was just generally a very summery fun song moving on from there of course I dug chance the rapper I might need security I talked about this track a little bit on the Fantana channel and respect to the chance the rapper buying the Chicago his thing but generally I love the instrumental of this track the Jamie Foxx sample think chances flow is nice think he's got a nice aggressive delivery on the track to a lot of heart shown on the song I dug the two other tracks that he dropped as well the wallet cam with super BW e and forever band which I thought was a pretty fun track work out which I loved the melody of - so you know chances just kind of killing out on this new channel its new crop of tracks overall in in my opinion and I don't know I'm just hoping for a great new project from him because I mean I know everybody doesn't agree with this but I think he has been getting better with every project you know some people of course are gonna prefer you know acid over coloring book and that sort of thing but again I think he's been getting better I think he's been improving and you know hopefully uh this is his best record to date when when in fact he does drop this and of course we have the new Brock Hampton track 1998 Truman which is a total banger excellent performances from Kevin abstract and Joba on here especially Merlin who lays down one of my favorite performances of the group's discography on this thing Matt champion sounds great on it - I love what they did with bear face at one point in the track while it was you know in his usual vocal style and everything I like that they're sort of bringing in different musical and stylistic shifts into their songs and coming out with some pretty epic results so yeah to me this track sort of felt like it was fitting a lot of different ideas in just like with a wildfire but to me this one came together so much better so yeah pretty pretty psyched pretty hype for the group's new album and I I believe the the name of this group or not in the name but rather the pronunciation of this group is a boston aaj further still is the name of this upcoming album and they have a new track out titled crux and I've talked about this group before I believe in like a y-you know review or like offhandedly maybe in another video like this they're an experimental black metal band from California they've been around a while now like they've been droppin records for years at this point and this is a song over here that they dropped is maybe one of the most animalistic and blistering and exciting the band has ever put out so I'm hoping that they kind of keep that up on this new album of theirs there were a few songs from their last full-length LP that did kind of excite me going into it but overall the album was just a little inconsistent and odd in terms of its like flow and everything so I'm kind of hoping for something that's just a bit more logical in terms of progression across the entire record on this this forthcoming one so and Oh Bonnie Prince Billy blueberry jam I wouldn't take this song too seriously we'll all of him essentially is coming out with this like sort of a social statement but also sort of like a joke novelty song just about blueberries totally looking like something out of fucking Arrested Development the music video is absolutely ridiculous and he just really kind of is just fucking hamming it up the whole video and then the whole song too so I mean it's a very fun track it's a very silly tongue-in-cheek song from an artist who you know I never thought I'd hear him going that far in this sort of direction on any song ever much less a music video but hey here we are it's wonderful and that has been this this week's edition of the weekly track roundup everybody hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this video thank you very much for watching and once again thank you to our sponsor in this video like many other weekly track roundups the good people over at the ridge that make these wonderful minimalist tight aluminum they go metal reinforced while it's that sweetly fit in your front pocket and are much nicer than my old ratty leather non-vegan wallet that I was happy to get rid of so alright guys you're the best love you love you love you love you love you I will see you in the next video and I remember all of the songs and everything that I spoke about in this video are linked down there in the description so if you want to hear any of the shit that I discussed in this video check it out down there give it a shot down there all right you're the best you're the best [Music] 
pao9YD2S0d8,hi everyone Dorcas malukas here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a vinyl update where i go over some records that have made their way into my beloved collection behind me over here and ever-growing into that other yellow shelf over there too which is getting larger and larger so let's see what I have picked up as of late or at least what I have had in rotation for a little bit but I haven't gotten to quite a few of these records and picks over here I actually grabbed on tour at some point so a few of them actually come with a bit of a story a fan of the show who came out to my New Jersey show actually arrived with this over here a cassette copy of little pumps a self-titled mixtape and I I think his intention he he wrote seven out of ten and sharpie honey I think his intention was originally to just have me sign it but I I just I assumed it was a present and I said oh is this for me and he says why you you can have it if you want I know it'll go to a good home so you just straight up gaming this cassette and it's a beautiful pink cassette I didn't even opened it yeah because I think I just want to keep it sealed for posterity you know I don't even know if this will sound any better on cassette then it just says digitally so I don't know I feel like I just want to save this until it's it's worth two hundred thousand dollars because obviously this is going to accrue value this is going to increase in value over the years and I don't know I just kind of want to leave it to my great-grandkids and hopefully this this teaches them that during a time at which I probably should have stopped listening to music by now but I'm still doing it at the time that I should have stopped listening to music there was still amazing music being made so future generations can look back high points in human creativity such as these so alright next another very generous fan of the show bought me a copy of Childish Gambino's awaken my love and it's like the ultra thick deluxe box set over here billed as a virtual album there's a double LP set over here even though it's not that long of an LP but they cut the LPS so that they play at 45 let's just straight black vinyl pretty thick pretty thick vinyl you know not not weak not weak pressings or anything like that I love those visuals for the two LP LP sleeves it comes with a booklet as well which is a pretty sweet filled with amazing little visuals throughout if you've ever wanted to see the the front cover image from this from the profile angle hello there if you ever wanted to see that it's right there it's pretty sweet booklet now as far as the virtual album thing goes so apparently this thing comes with cardboard goggles and you're supposed to take them and unfold them and everything like like put put your phone in there so you kind of see it and and then you're kind of like looking at looking at the virtual reality I'm looking at the virtual reality through these goggles so you look at the virtual reality while your phone is encased in here there's like an app you have to download I did all of the above but apparently the app that I downloaded because this album is 2 years old now and I assume this this pressing is as well because the album is 2 years old it doesn't seem like the the app any longer supports the the the the virtual the virtual album experience so unfortunately I think I'm a little late to the awaken my love virtual album experience with the that I had to download and everything but um it's still a cool album and it's still a very generous gift and I greatly appreciate it so you know thank you very much I really again am flattered at the kindness and generosity that people showed me when I was out on tour and you know eventually we'll have another one in the works very soon so you know for all the people in the Midwest and the west coast and you know other areas as well it's gonna take me a little while to get to everywhere that I want to get to but you know you do stay patient you know I'll get there I'll get to it this next record that I wanted to show you guys is probably the most I've spent on an album in a long long time I haven't spent this much money on that many records but I bought a used copy because they refused to reissue it son and Boris's altar this is easily one of the not the best album of each artists respectively but easily one of the better albums of each artist respectively a really cool collaborative experimental metal drone metal album that's actually not that long it's about an hour in length you know if you're trying to dip your toes into the drone metal genre I mean I I still think I probably recommend records like earth-2 or white 2 or black one but this is this is not a bad taste or either especially since with boris in the mix you do have some extra layers of guitar you do have some drums here and there so it does add a bit more flavor to the sound and will the sound of drum metal which is typically pretty one-dimensional in some respects and it is epic packaging I mean the the the cover itself and everything a little dog-eared but um you know the the the packaging and the whole booklet lease into this thing is still in a really great condition so I can't thank you I can't really complain with this purchase you know and this isn't even like one of the more expensive used copies that I've seen online so I kind of jumped on top of it I've had this on digital for a while and I've been meaning that get it on vinyl because it did it's their record like this is gonna sound more I guess heavy on vinyl there's gonna be more bass there's gonna be more presence now this version I don't know if every vinyl copy of this album is like this because I haven't done my research into it that deeply but this is a triple LP set whereas I know originally the the album is as far as the digital pressings go and the digital copy that I had it's just like the six tracks it's just an hour but there's an additional LP with like a thirty minute song on it which I listened to I thought it was just okay the track is titled her lips were wet with venom I thought it was okay maybe not as great as some of the earlier tracks so that we're already on the LP but I love this color this it's slightly see-through it's you know a deep green it's got some black sort of like splatters and ripples in it that's the color of each of the three LPS so I'm pretty happy with that and the pressing is thick thicker than a bowl of oatmeal I like my vinyl pressings like I like my booties real real thick so there you go nice a nice thick triple drum metal LP that I'm happy to finally get my grubby Dorcas Mallorca hands on just very very happy very pleased with that alright moving on this is another grab that came from somebody by the name of Nate I got a lot of demos while I was out on tour and I wouldn't say this track is exactly or rather what I'm about to pull out here is is a demo I don't know if the band itself would consider it a demo but it's it's clearly like an underground release it's clearly like a ban on the more local side of things but they have a sharp sense of humor this was hilarious to listen to I'm a little disappointed that when opening this thing up or rather putting it onto the turntable it wasn't a grindcore record but it was some really whacked-out mutant indie rock with some quirky vocals ridiculous fucking lyrics and a hilarious premise this this is the front cover it's it's just it's just literally the McDonald's logo it's it's just the McDonald's logo but the back of it features like a McDonald's logo on fire McDonald's logo on fire I believe the band's name is turbo sleaze yeah turbo sleeves is the band and here's here's the the track titles okay you need to hear these the first Baskin Robbins in Afghanistan number one the hamburglar's inevitable hamburger burglary number two Ronald McDonald's unusual balls class that's number three the curse of Mayor McCheese is bloodied purse a purse curse by Agatha Christie number four grimaces grimace inducing grimace number five fry kids PCP Adventure Leia that's number six and the number seven is birdie this came out 2015 apparently again it's very funny it's very whacked out it's very wild it kind of reminds me of a lot of the indie rock the underground indie stuff of the 2000s where it was very absurdist it was very colorful it was very strange and usually enhanced by just just a really I don't give a fuck attitude and just a total lack of inhibition so shout out again to Nate for bringing the type of joy into my life that only an EP such as this could could bring and of course the the little record itself is like McDonald's logo orange so can't go wrong with that so turbo sleeves turbo sleeves next you guys know it already you love it it is Caracara Benito's debut album I love this this this is the Navy right this was the debut ID this is a debut I mean or regardless its bonito generation I'm having a brain fart here it's late so the band finally put this on vinyl they sent me a copy so I thank them greatly for doing that I really appreciate the generosity think the album is fantastic love this cute little poster that it comes with given the recording style of the album I didn't really go into this vinyl expecting it to sound all that much different from the digital version and that's pretty much the case but hey I do love the record and I wasn't gonna turn down a free record of a record that I love and you know it was fun to play it on the turntable I love that blue that is a nice shade of blue whoever color coordinated this whole packaging set is a God so you know very very nice I for the color and packaging and everything I really I really appreciate that I love the color she's such a nice bright Pink's blues and yellows for whatever reason I just find it very relaxing and this this is one of the cutest pop records of the decade let's get that out of the way alright next next another fan of the show not not while I was out on tour but literally online just emailed me and said hey can I send you a record and I said what record are you are you sending because you know I only have so much room I I'm gonna get in trouble my marriage is going to be in trouble if I take on so many records that they just fill the house and I don't want to do that I like being married I love my significant other I don't want to put us in a situation where she has to step around records everywhere because I'm just accepting all records carte blanche if I'm even using that phrase correctly probably not but the guy said oh it's it's a new copy of this heats deceit and I said yeah bro send me that shit lickety-splickety I never realized not now that it's blown up I mean I've heard this album bunch of times digitally I've never had it on vinyl I've never realized since seeing the album art so blown up and in front of me that this is like a weird image of a face but like weird projected images on top of it it's actually kind of freaky and disturbing if you're unfamiliar with this heat this record from them to see is easily one of the best sort of experimental rock and post-punk albums out there I listen to the record in a while but in retrospect god this album influenced so much shit that was even a moment on here where I'm just like goddamn this part sounds like grizzly bears at yellow house and and the thing is like the entire album doesn't even sound like that you know it's just like a weird spare spot that just had like such an eerie similarity to uh to the record and I know the band is huge and I know that they're one of those bands they're kind of like musicians musicians you know what I mean like this this is a bit of an obscure experimental rock post-punk gem you know like I don't hear as far as like post-punk band conversations like this heat does not get brought up enough but a lot of the people who I know who love them typically tend to be musicians because like when you're a musician like this is exactly the kind of record that some people want to make like oh I wish I could come up with those like whacked-out experimental ideas that just sort of seem to almost have no like bass in reality or just like where the hell is this shit coming from as far as like influences like it's just one of those fucking records where it's just like the the the the origins of it just seems so fucking insane or they just they just seem so singular or unique or just disconnected from the grandeur land scheme rather landscape is the word I'm looking for of just popular music and even most well-received underground music so this heat to seat highly recommended do do give it do give it a listen to give it a shot alright next this is a record that all of you guys should be pretty familiar with by now I gave it a nine this year it is one of the better review records that I've done this year the new against all logic record Nicholas jar releasing music that he recorded from 2012 to 2017 under a different name for alias it is easily one of the best house records I have heard this decade it is amazing the sampling is fantastic the bass lines are great the rhythms the grooves the melodic and instrumental progressions I loved from front to back across the entire thing there might be one track I find kind of underwhelming on here but it is an amazing record and I love this on the back basically this record is calling me out if you don't know jack about house then you'll love this so I mean I love it so I must not know jack about house I guess I'm pretty simple packaging over here I bought this thing in the UK or not that I went to the UK I bought it online from the UK so just a double LP over here not you know the heaviest vinyl that I've ever handled in my life but the record actually sounds I don't know if the the mastering process for the vinyl was all that much different from the digital master but I don't know just on vinyl on my hi-fi just sounded amazing it sounded pristine so I really do appreciate that you know it did it did hit me quite a quite a bit harder on record then it did just kind of streaming it online or even just sort of buying and listening to the digital version because I didn't know they were gonna come out with a vinyl of this so I just kind of bought it digitally right away thinking that this is a one-off project it's weird alias like people didn't even know at first it was him who knows if he's gonna pay a tenth you know give this the attention to that it deserves on like a physical release and so yeah I just bought it digitally right away not knowing those gonna be vinyl and hey there was so whoa I jumped on it because I think it's amazing and there you go so alright next next another fan of the show actually handed this to me on tour this records stored a copy of Circle Jerks gig which I was sort of looking for but I didn't end up going out on Record Store Day because I think it was up really late the night before and I just ended up sleeping in and then I went out later and and miraculously I think I went to the record store a few days before record store day and spent a ton of money already so I said okay so I don't know if I should do that two times in one week but it's still it's a decent live recording you know I mean there's a lot of circle-jerk songs on here that I like nothing flashy or crazy about the packaging or anything you know it has songs that Circle Jerks fans should be familiar with like junk mail and world up my ass and so on and so forth minoes like I feel like the vocals left a little bit to be desired because of course like it's a punk show you know like Keith's vocals that they're not always into the microphone because part of the fun part of the fun of a punk show is just like the physical experience the visceral experience like seeing it in person I mean the recording is decent but you know they're they're also a pump in they're not gonna play the songs that differently in person and they are on record it's cool you know I'm probably gonna keep it around didn't end up wow me as much as I thought it would I thought maybe in like the live recording would be a bit more vicious didn't find it to be so though but hey you know I'm not gonna turn down a copy of this it's it's quite nice to have alright a couple more I picked this up earlier in the year I actually ordered it right after I reviewed the record and gave it a very positive review of the new portal album if you guys are missing my review of this please go check it out I also talked about it in my favorite albums of the year so far video and this is an excellent technical experimental noisy and avant-garde metal record death metal record to be specific I loved the silvery strange art that is all over this thing it's very um it's it's very kind of turn-of-the-century ish if I'm if I'm kind of getting that correctly like like technocratic comment kind of imagery over here like lightning bolts and buildings and there's all sorts of strange diagrams and mathematical equations inside of the gatefold and again I just love the silvery the silvery finish of the whole thing it's a beautiful package the the vinyl itself they sent in a plastic sleeve because otherwise it would be sitting in this which is like crazy it's it's awesome they sent it in a plastic sleeve because I imagine you don't want this gets sent in the mail and it's ruined because this seems like they spent a whole lot of money on having bees produced and it's kind of like this waxy plastic film of a sleeve it's kind of see-through and again you kind of have those like equations with the one-two-three-four five-six-seven-eight these octagon figures on both sides I can't believe I just counted the sides of an octagon in front of you guys that's that's surely going to be a comment down there look at it earth to me doesn't no fucking octagon when he sees one well okay fine bear okay and this also comes with a giant this is like the biggest poster ever it's like the biggest longest poster I've ever received in it in a record I don't even know if like like most posters I get with records this takes out the whole the whole screen this takes up the whole screen most most records that I have when I come with posters like it's it's it's 3/4 of this and that's it this has like an extra third on it well there you go it's a gigantic poster it's freaking gigantic now of course also kind of sticking with the aesthetic of the the album the the record itself has the silvery you know octagon figure on there too and it's it's just clear it's a nice clear record it sounds pretty sweet this could have to do with my I have like a high-end stylus on on my table everything on it plays super clean and the recording is not as cacophonous at least it doesn't sound that way as much on the table as it did when I was just kind of listening to it digitally which kind of shifted my view of it a little bit but it still sounded pretty nasty pretty experimental very odd very out-there so I don't even know I'm saying any of that I'm just I guess I'm just talking and rambling because I got to be talking and rambling because if I'm not talking in this video what am i doing what am i doing not doing anything what do you what do you what what's the point of this why are we here I don't know trying to get it back in the record try and get it back in there the sleeve come on buddy come on come on you can do it you can do what I believe in you I believe in you you can do it I believe in you I believe in you that which i also hope ends up being a thing that pops up down in the comments I believe in you okay remember guys your your Millennials and you have more education than any previous generation and you have the system has totally fucked you economically and I think the success of this generation will greatly depend on its ability to I guess assemble against the powers that be and and and fight for the same opportunities that generations previous to you were allotted but they blame all of your problems on you despite the fact that they they fucked things up pretty bad before you got there I don't know how I got on that ramp but hey gonna leave it in there all right this next one is one of the rockingest kick-ass inist fucking metal albums of the 2000s Boris's pink I met a guy over at 88 rising who we like shot a segment which I don't even know if and when it's even gonna come out like it was like months ago and we shot it and they were just like showing me kpop and just like asking me to like rate it and give my opinion on it and and I did and it was a cool segment and one of the dudes taking part in the video production he had brought his vinyl collection in his name is Olaf and he brought his vinyl collection in as like a prop you know just kind of like to hang out in the background and I I could tell he watched me pretty religiously because a lot of the records in the collection were albums I owned and albums that I have given very positive reviews to but one thing he had in that collection that I did not have was this amazing cardboard sleeved triple fucking LP version of Boris's pink which like I love that album I think it's a great album but I was like whoa I didn't know that was like this amazing like package out there of it and lo and behold there is and it was still available so I grabbed it but yeah this is an amazing shiny thick triple LP cardboard sleeve let's let's give it a pop oh wow sorry sorry if i gasm there a little bit I'm so disgusting I don't know why you guys washed me but yeah this is this is a nice reddish purplish yeah what that gradient love that color scheme and it sounds great the riffs are awesome it's so fuzzy it's so heavy it's so energetic like boris has a pretty versatile discography you know you have records like their latest record which are really dark and you know super heavy and hard-hitting you have records where they kind of are doing like maybe a little bit of a j-rock j-pop kind of thing where they were kind of dabbling in that for a little bit you have records where it's like purely a drone metal experience and you have records like this where it's like it's just more of a straight rock record but super heavy and I'm loving that I'm loving that deluxe edition deluxe edition Thank You sergeant house not the certain house you know they put it out I didn't send it to me I bought it but I'm really happy they put this out and really happy it exists and this is actually an extra LP of like forbidden songs so you know just basically like you know session tracks that didn't end up making the original cut of the LP the the whole thing comes with this nice pink sort of booklet which you know just because general liner notes and information and that sort of thing the lyrics and all that and the sleeve actually serves as the coloring for the inside of the this over here which you know see see you see me you see me help help I'm in jail help me help me I don't even know what is the point of this series anymore is it just for me to come on here and just act like a total idiot in front of you while I unpackage records that I just bought that must be the point of this this youtube series is this video gonna get to a million views because that's just the kind of entertainment people are seeking out on YouTube I hope so alright this next one I haven't even opened yet I haven't even opened it yeah I'm spanking it and I probably shouldn't be because this is this is very nice final worst story about the tour while I was out on tour I went to Nashville because that was one of the places that we went to we went to a great venue called the end the punk iasts Kamiya SMO space on earth and before we went in there I completely unannounced decided I was just gonna go down to third man records and you know because I like Jack white I like his whole operation I thought you know I could hang around in the store and maybe just pick up some stuff and if somebody recognized me I can go come inside permit or let me see the inside please so we parked and on our way in I just like had some garbage and I had to go throw it out in the dumpster that they had out in front and I know I know some businesses tend to get testy about their dumpster usage and I didn't want anybody getting mad at me for just kind of throwing my plebeian trash inside of their dumpster that they pay for the space in and so you know I threw my garbage away and then I'm just like trying to be like super incognito about it and walk away and then I just feel like are you Anthony phantoms if they fancy and I'm like fuck I'm gonna get in trouble for throwing stuff away fuck and I turn in this very tall man dressed all in black with blond hair who turned out to be mr. Ben Blackwell introduced himself and I just yeah I'm Anthony hey what's going on I thought it was a be like hey man you could take that shit out of that dumpster dickhead fuck you do it you pay for that dumpster but he's just like what are you doing here and I'm just like I'm just here to check out the store and just see what's going on and he was stepping out of this docking bay with other people who worked there and they were clearly like moving something or shipping something or in the middle of like working and you just said come on doing the tour I don't even have to ask yes yes the tour yes internally that's what I was like I was outside I was trying to act cool and try not to act like a dork so yeah he took us on the whole thing and it was everything that I imagined it would be it was just basically like Willy Wonka's chocolate factory but for vinyl and he showed us the recording studio and spot where they do their live events and their live recordings and I saw tons of stuff in there probably stuff I maybe should not even talk about but in the the midst of the you know the whole shebang they were in the middle of shipping tens of thousands of copies of this record this new reissued version of Captain Beefheart's trout mask replica which comes loaded you have to get it like in their in their vinyl of subscription series and it comes with like a tote a trout mask replica tote so that's amazing and again I know this comes with a lot of extras I didn't even pop this open so let's adventure adventure through this together app I've I've read about some of the things that this comes with and I didn't really stress sort of playing this before I did this because I just you know it's its Third Man Records and I know jack has a lot of reverence for this album he's not gonna put this album out and had it sound like shit I know he's pretty peculiar when it comes to sound so I know I'm not going to be complaining about the sound of this record so Wow there it is and all its glory and you know obviously that picture of the good captain and the band on the back there I mean I know this picture was shot decades ago but I mean they basically look like a bunch of hipsters now and I love that the look hasn't really changed all that much that hat is very very normcore like you could see that baseball cap that were that pinkish red of reddish baseball cap a Mac DeMarco fan would wear that you know yeah but let's let's move on opening up the gatefold let's see oh cool oh wow it's like crackling like a book like it's just like it's it's fresh it's fresh crazy psychedelic pictures and imagery as I remember from if I if this is also in there I believe I had a CD copy that had the same imagery in the the other booklet also what song isn't believe it's a China page Jack White did a really great cover of that song alright let's so let's let's keep going let's keep going ooh very cool very cool picture of the captain very young they're very young picture of the captain they're young image of the captain's okay so this is like okay this is a whole like looks like a lyric sheet and it looks like it is yep lyric sheet so and the captain's lyrics are quite strange so if you do want to have anyone's lyrics in print it is it is Captain Beefheart's Mantaray a black and white hand groped in okay there's there's more Don poetry right there well just like sort of scratched and you know just like cursive messy lettering a very abstract image on the back right there loving this the third man the third man seal over here so the official third man seal printing on there oh my god what fucking pressing it's clear grayish black with splotches of purple red green blue there's like maybe a touch of yellow in there that kind of gets lost in the the greys but maybe that's also left over from the oranges or the Reds like what the fuck this is insane who'd advised I've never seen a fucking record look like this and it's like almost layered like like some splotches show up better on this side than they do this side so it's like you're kind of like looking through a few layers of colors and it's thick as a brick buddy this is thick and it's hard Jesus wow that was a trip obviously there's another LP here it probably looks just as nutty and of course I knew this came with a 7-inch of the tracks pachuco cadaver in wildlife hopefully I'm saying that correctly looks like a nice cool little 45 over here it is cocaine white as I'm sure a lot of people back then we're doing that and this is an epitaph for the the good captain himself looks like it's written by Jack white 1941 to 2010 it'll be interesting to sort of read that man it's written on this beautiful blue velvety silvery paper in blind green font like a very odd contrast but I love and it's thick too I love the detail they put into everything here and of course as advertised there is the trout trout the the the mask itself the replica trout mask classic third man that classic third man sense of humor the replica trout mask yeah you can literally pop it out of this thing and there's there's eyes the eyes might be a little tiny though I don't even think again I guess it sort of matches up but yeah this is this is my replica trout mask everybody fast and bulbous I feel like such a dork in front of you guys I'm just looking at the second LP over here because god this looks so it's sane this is look insane it's look insane to you the look there you go it's right behind the white background you see the colors there I mean I saw the way that the vinyl was I saw the promotional material I saw the pictures of it and I thought it looked cool but like the image that they promoted this with did not do this justice because in person it looks crazy like the layers and the different colors and the the variants I'm sure that run across all of the records is well I mean it says right here bizarre I agree bizarre Wow this is a heavy package and I'm I'm happy that I didn't open it before this because we experience it together I guess in a way I'm highly uh I have a great amount of respect I guess is what I'll say for anybody else who got this in the mail because I'm sure it was like I'm sure it was like Christmas a very nice very nice epic epic packaging on this and hey you know it's an album that fucking deserves it I mean I gave this thing a classic review look it up on my channel it's a highly influential insane album a landmark album I mean as I said before maybe not my favorite Beefheart release but it's it's certainly worthy of the attention all the attention it's received over the years the cult following that it has received over the years and still to this day still to this day not not really much out there in terms of other albums that are like it it's really it really kind of truly is a one-of-a-kind album despite the fact that it has been so influential and you can hear its influence in in many many places because the the captain is one of a kind artists not a style not a sound that one could easily copy again captain one-of-a-kind artist one-of-a-kind band on this album the conditions under which this album was performed written and recorded were incredibly unique too so again probably another reason that there's not another album out there like this but yeah trap mask replica Captain Beefheart and his magic band and that has been this latest edition of the vinyl update awesome awesome thank you very much for watching over here next to my head is playlist where you can check out other videos in our vinyl update series and sort of see other albums that have made it into into my collection over here and love you love you love you Anthony Fantana forever 
pr1-OuxjrAo,hey everybody how do you do welcome to the why you know review we're gonna go through a bunch of records I didn't do in a review so thank you for watching let's go yeah it's the it's the worst thing they've released it it really really is unfortunately I was pretty much as excited as everyone else to hear Parliament's new record in well over a decade but this thing is just so overblown and cumbersome I mean the band's best projects back in the day had a tight 44 minutes of material with good production with great performances some of the mixing on this thing is a little shoddy like the group vocals I think could have used a bit more space some of the drums bass and guitar just feel like they fall a little flat sometimes while I do like some of the guests artists and the semi political tone and the concept of the record on the whole there's just so much kind of keeping this from its full potential it's just too bogged down in unnecessary and drab and uninteresting tracks it's unfortunate that Parliament kind of focused on just dropping as much material as possible as opposed to I don't know just just kind of trimming it down to the best of the best of the best and making a great record [Music] shoutout to Ouija Mac because this dude is easily the most interesting thing going on in the Juggalo scene right now which is I know something I don't talk about a lot on this channel but this student has taken the the typical soundcloud aesthetic and is putting a bit of an insane clown twist on it and it's pretty cool it sounds a lot like a lot of the other stuff that you hear coming out of the soundcloud scene but it's a bit eerie or it's a bit freakier it's a bit darker it's a bit more tongue-in-cheek and can't be as a lot of the music from the Juggalo scene tends to be I don't know given a lot of what goes viral these days I don't see why most people couldn't give this a try and come out liking it so why not yeah I mean I really love tracks like look alive but this project pretty much just showed me that I enjoy block boy JB most in in small doses because his style is delivery his lyrics they're all pretty one-dimensional while I wouldn't say he's as dumbed down and overly simplified as some other rappers out there his similes follow a pretty basic formula his verses and his rapping are constantly chopped up over and over and over on every single track to the point where it's like dude can can can you just wrap can we just hear you like rapped without any editing I mean it does add a cool effect here and there but after a while it just kind of gets a little incessant but yeah again a track or two here they're in small doses it's great but for the long haul this thing pretty much exposes just how surface-level black boy JB's whole style is [Music] Fat Tony coming together with charge it to the game on this one for a freaky weird and funny set of synth pop tracks with some pretty grimy raps on top some of which are kind of topical and off the beaten path like the song dark girl which is all about goth girls you know if anything is kind of holding this record back it's that some of the instrumentals and some of the rapping and the recording it's it's kind of rickety the whole thing just kind of feels like a very low five-bedroom recorded novelty project sometimes unfortunately it's it's it's not as sharp and well assembled as I would like to be but still there's a lot of personality on here and there are some really fun moments so if you are looking for a kind of weird and very left-field rap project with a lot of personality and a sense of humor and you don't care that it's a little rough around the edges give this a shot for the better part of three or four weeks now I've been having just a hard time struggling to see the hype behind this new Georgia Smith album I mean to me it just pretty much sounds like Rihanna singing over a lot of instrumentals that Lauren Hill or Amy Winehouse would hop on top of I mean it's kind of classy it's a little ritzy it's smooth its soulful I think that she really kind of cares about songwriting more than some of the artists who obviously influenced her vocally do but I still kind of feel like she's got a little while to go before she's not completely drowning in her influences to the point where it's distracting I've got a lot of requests and questions about this new Mike Shinoda album I mean I didn't really care all that much for Mike sound leading up to the demise of Linkin Park and lo and behold I mean we kind of have the very anthemic melodic rap rock stylings of music on this new record that we kind of heard leading up to the release of this album but of course mike is going into great detail when it comes to the emotional trauma that he has suffered with the demise of the band with the loss of his friend Chester Bennington and I mean while I definitely sympathize and and I totally feel for the narrative and the personal themes of the record the story of the record the the horrible occurrences that inspired Mike to make this album I just don't care for the sound I don't care for the production the mix of genres I don't care for the lyricism the songs I really don't care for any of it musically then I'm just gonna leave it at that [Music] yet another album from the Neo psych electronic dance outfit Gang Gang dance I was pretty hyped to try it given that I was very lukewarm on their last album but everybody seemed pretty hype about that and I was kind of wondering like what am I missing what am I not getting like what is it about this band's music that seems to be appealing to other people and I'm just I don't know kind of in the dark on it I'm not really sure I mean I can appreciate the the mix of again psychedelic music dance music even new age and and art pop music that kind of flows throughout the record on this thing but I don't know a lot of it just kind of seems so distant and reverb doubt and alien and it just kind of feels like it's a obscure electronic music from a cult or like a long-lost Society living somewhere in obscurity on the planet Earth that we've now recently discovered and and this is is the the music of their land and I don't know I'm just so far outside of the context of it I don't I don't quite get the appeal of it which is odd because that's not to say that there aren't really familiar ideas and concepts throughout this album there certainly are but I guess just again a lot of them don't resonate with me outside of like maybe some of the more hard-hitting dance tracks those I think are pretty cool they've got some great grooves but the sort of strange and squeaky vocals that at some points I don't think go far enough the very glossy sense and atmospheres I don't know they all just feel kind of hollow to me I've been getting a lot of requests for this new mom jeans album and I have no idea why this is like one of the laziest Midwest emo records I've heard in a while like the guitar work is really sloppy the vocals are downright awful the way all the instrumentation comes together on this record is a total freaking mess the songwriting on this thing features one emo cliche after another emo cliche after another emo cliche and just none of it is interesting in the slightest like I I get that technical ability isn't everything of course but I feel like that loss of any kind of technical or basic music assembly fundamentals that should be on this album have have not been sucked out of this record in lieu of anything else like it's it's really just kind of overly emotional slop to mold is a band whose name that even saying it gives me an upper respiratory issue and they pretty much have like a nice deadly brutal blood caked meat-and-potatoes death metal album over here it's not too overly clean it's not too melodic it's not too progressive or technical I wouldn't say it's too brutal either it's really just kind of a middle-of-the-road death metal album something that kind of sounds like it could have come out of the 90s except maybe a little bit slower and a little bit heavier given modern recording techniques and everything I wouldn't really say that there's anything too distinct about any of it I mean if you love some Cannibal Corpse and like that you're gonna you're gonna get a lot out of this record you know also some autopsy - if you like some autopsy give this thing a shot you know if you kind of just start a hardcore death metal fan and you just kind of love that classic sound you're probably gonna dig on this yeah there were a few bangers on this new Meek Mill EP it's cool that he's still releasing music I'm glad that he's back I'm glad that he's back in the studio you know I guess maybe I'll kind of wait until he drops something a bit more substantial to kind of do a back flip or something like that but it was got a few hard hitters on here and obviously a lot of the lyrics throughout this EP kind of detail at least a little bit a lot of what he's been going through over the past few years or so you know with all of his legal woes and that sort of thing so yeah it's not a bad EP it ain't bad sorry yeah this is pretty much average mixtape future lots of very moody trap instrumentals kind of melodic from as a Tobin future vocally is just kind of riffing with lots of auto-tune on his voice it's just kind of very basic future project you've heard it already [Music] so this is the first full-length album that the classic Nordic death metal band immortal has released since the departure of their longtime frontman abbath who kind of embarked on a bit of a solo career recently dropped a solo LP and yeah they just pretty much stick to their stylistic guns on this one even the vocals don't seem to have undergone that great of a change because the replacement vocalists had already been a member of the band prior so it's a pretty standard black metal affair with the tremolo Pickett ARS and the blast beads and the dark wintery atmosphere and the retched vocals and that sort of thing but it's immortal you know they kind of helped develop the sound to what it is today so you can't really fault them for not wanting to a very from it too too heavy there are a few tracks on here that I kind of lengthy kind of epic the recording overall is pretty clean and heavy longtime black metal fans who are more of the purist set will most likely not walk away from this thing disappointed and fans who were looking to kind of familiarize themselves a little bit more with black metal I recommend trying a record like this even though it's maybe not one of the in the genre it certainly is The Blueprint presented in a pretty clean and straightforward fashion so again if you're kind of looking to dip your toes into this style of music understand what it's all about I think this record could be a good gateway drug Des Moines Iowa singer and songwriter Karen meat has a pretty fun cheeky and playful little album over here it's kind of like a fusion of bedroom pop lo-fi 60s girl group stuff synth funk and synth pop on quite a few tracks too a lot of songs about people being ugly people or being broke or being unhappy being bored drinking it's a very sloppy and unapologetic album it's a very raw and I would say kind of a quirky record to the humor of it is kind of like a mix of Moldy Peaches and Frank Zappa and Arielle pink it's got a lot of personality occasionally some of the instrumentals are kind of sloppy the songwriting leaves a little bit to be desired the lyrics can be endearing in just how I guess Valle nura balandin e ously there are points when I think Karen could have like put things in a more interesting way I guess still it's a relatively fun LP and Karen is an artist - I think I'll continue to look out for this new EP from the band's spiritual cramped is actually pretty cool these guys are a punk band for all intents and purposes but they have a kind of weird warped dark mutant sound - - their whole thing there's even a track on here with a guitar lick that sort of sounds like the intro to The Clash's London Calling so the their influences do kind of range from older to newer but again there's something like kind of toxic waste melting skin there's like I don't know there's something about like the music on this EP that just makes me think that like zombies are playing it or some kind of freaks of nature or something like that the vocals are particularly weird think like maybe I don't know glenn danzig in a Troma movie or something like that it's a very cool little EP give it a shot give it a shot give it a shot [Music] so the new Lykke Li album which I was kind of looking forward to even if her last full length album was kind of a mixed bag but unfortunately she kind of gets rid of all of the things that made her music appealing in the past and instead tries to become this mainstream fusion of pop and trap music and the transition is really awkward like I do not see these songs appealing to the listener base of people who typically dabble in this this brand of pop music and I don't really see this appealing to her core fanbase all that much either yeah just kind of a flop I guess we're just continuing to reach that peak trap I guess and that's it that has been the latest episode of why you no review thank you for watching over here

OWDogwWqb_A,ah hi everyone contractual obligations here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new snail mail album lush this is the debut full-length album from singer-songwriter Lindsey Jordan and her band a new artist that the greater part of the indie scene has flocked to as an exciting up-and-comer and I was somewhat enamoured myself going into this project with the fuzzy guitar leads and super tight drumming and dejected but sweet lead vocals featured on the lead single heatwave but going deeper into this album I was having a harder time finding what exactly all the excitement over this album was about sure Jordan does seem like a pretty capable songwriter her vocal melodies are relatively sticky her voice is pretty youthful in earnest her singing and her lyrics pretty much are the selling point of the album and even though I'm not blown away by them right now she's still starting out pretty young so there's plenty of room for her to grow and progress and evolve and I'm definitely hearing a lot of potential in what's being presented right now Jordan doesn't have one of the more original vocal deliveries out there but her singing is genuinely despondent and her voice is more dynamic than it might seem at first to on some of the verses to these cuts her singing might come off kind of understated and meek but on many of the hooks of this record it's like her voice opens up and gains a slightly deeper more womanly tone that kind of hits like a warning siren she smartly saves some of the best singing bits on these songs toward the very end like on the track pristine but outside of that there aren't many distinct or exciting things about lush the album generally sounds like very plain mid pace 90s indie and alternative rock but with a kind of softened and reverb even ear that fits into the dreamy aesthetic that a lot of underground rock follows these days Thank You Mac DeMarco Beach fossils real estate and more tracks like speaking terms and pristine and even cuts I genuinely find likable such as heatwave the guitar work the drumming the chord progressions they're all pretty plain and sort of nondescript the production in the recording are pretty good the performances seem organic enough a few of the tunes here and there seem a little awkwardly tastes leaving me feeling like I'm just waiting forever for some kind of payoff for all of these persistently moody passages topped with many many layers of malaise like the song full control the two minutes before the big payoff on that song just feels like an eternity to me the best moments on the LP to me are some of the most stripped-back intimate and slow like the tracks stick or the acoustic and finger pick let's find it out where Jordan's ability for balladry really shines the finishing cut anytime - which also brings a decent feel of finality to the album the lyrics on the record are generally pretty heartbroken and lovesick I get the sense that Jordans poetry is coming from her own experience or a very real place but much of the time her word choice is just alright in the scenarios that she describes in her lyrics are less than spectacular so while I think there's a good baseline of fundamentals and talent on this album it's certainly a listenable record it's Pleasant while it's on snail mail unfortunately doesn't do much to build on top of this alright Foundation outside of delivering some above-average vocals and some summer Krush lyrics I'm feeling a strong 5 - a light 6 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like ly subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a video that you can check out you can hit that or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana snail-mail forever 
O5VtHXdfZPM,huh hi everyone language Denis barrier Tanner here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Herren amore album Haruto sera I hope I said that right this is the debut full-length album from Yokohama singer Hyuna Miri who built up to this release of the few singles and mini albums and while her new record here is billed as a J pop release this album is actually so much more for the most part it doesn't really deliver the ultra bright Dancy and synthetic sounds that we typically expect from the j-pop genre though there are certainly elements of that popping up here and there of course these are also mixed with elements of hip-hop and post-hardcore noise pop and art rock so to label this as a J pop album it's not too far off even though artistically I kind of find more parallels between this record and Japan's very long and rich history of experimental noisy underground rock and punk music I certainly find more common ground between this album and that then I do a koto or a perfume or a Kyary Pamyu Pamyu honest to god their drum and guitar parts on this album that sound like they could have been lifted straight out of a law dispute album but now they just like kind of have a Japanese singer on top and of course they're like more weird compositional detours throughout the instrumental too occasionally that does take away from the novelty of the record a little bit leaving me feeling like I'm just kind of hearing something that I've already heard before a bunch of times just under a different genre label with a different singer on top of it namely on the song Lost Planet however it's really a lot of the experimentation the pop rock elements and the rapping on these tracks that really puts Haru and this record into a category of its own the rapping on this thing is typically very hurried and tense there is rhythm to it but a lot of the time it kind of comes off as a spoken word there are a few cuts on here as well to see Haru quickly transitioning from this fevered rapping to just straight screaming her brains out like on Nara sheet a and rock-and-roll wash in and I surprisingly the language barrier didn't really hit me that hard on this record either I found it entertaining right from the first track because there are a lot of very diverse rock instrumentals hanging in the background on this thing that are pretty dynamic very well recorded and mixed passionately performed there are a lot of sweet melodies and interesting chord progressions to speak of too but still the melodies and vocal refrains on this record are pretty catchy regardless and translating the lyrics from Japanese to English led to some really interesting results - I caught what felt like a lot of very surreal imagery and word choices there are a couple of songs on here where the rapping or the vocal delivery is much more subtle and understated leading to maybe a bit of a lull in the album namely on the song 19 but a very similar vocal delivery on the eighth track of the album leads to an incredibly hypnotic and almost sensual experience there are also a few moments on the record where I think the band kind of cuts the full potential of a song off with a very abrupt ending like on the track underground which kicks off like this amazing euphoric piece of like 8-bit synth pop rock with these super bright chime e chords and these incredibly moody and intimate rapped vocals I wish the song went on some of the artistic and instrumental detours that many of the other tracks on here do like the surprise bit in the second leg of the title track on this thing where suddenly the instrumental starts speeding up as if the track is caught on a cassette tape that is moving its way to full fast-forward mode before the stop button just kind of clicks and ends the whole thing then bringing us into a final instrumental bridge where the guitars get kind of noisy and distorted and sour dissonant some anthemic soloing as well and a very climactic final refrain while there are a few tracks on this thing that i think could have used a bit of building out overall I find the brevity of this record to be an asset sans the remixes at the end of this thing the whole record kind of rounds out at about 37 minutes which causes Haru and her band to pack these three-minute songs with a lot of different ideas also there are a handful of short interlude cuts throughout the record that kind of introduced various tracks there are plenty of highlights on this thing from front to back like the blistering introduction make ma noise of you with driving guitars multitrack shouty vocals the guitar toan on this thing is really brittle and and trebly and burning fiery the drums are incredibly crisp they really pop in the mix Howard's expressive rapping on the track is excellent Nara sheet a that I mentioned earlier in the review is easily one of the catchiest tracks on the entire record the distortion a little English knob there and in hook is incredible the seventh track on here is a pretty fantastic blend of synth pop and anthemic alt-rock with this super sticky aaaa chorus chant the eleventh cut on here is the first song that introduced me to this project and it does this very tense beautiful and strange piece of piano rock with these persistent glistening chords it's incredibly dramatic harue lays all of these shouty vocal overdubs on the track that just makes her rapping feel even more just anxious and nail-biting it's really an emotionally potent listen no matter what language you speak the rock and roll closure is a fantastic and fiery ending to the entire thing and overall this record is a pretty fantastic and versatile pop rock album with lots of very noisy and experimental bits to kind of keep things interesting and cutting edge not to mention high ruse unlikely rap delivery on this thing kind of making the album as special as it is and separating her from many other artists in the j-pop field aside from a good handful of tracks that just left me wanting more or just felt a little underwhelming in comparison to others this is a really solid record it's also a reminder to me of what makes modern music so interesting that you can get these forward-thinking musical and stylistic blends of various genres assembled in a really unique way executed incredibly well written very well recorded very well and then tossed out there onto the internet for unsuspecting musical spelunkers to kind of stumble upon and and discover something really cool I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well and over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit or the only to subscribe to the channel yeah that's uh that's what you can do Anthony Fantana how ruin the miry forever 
pAmg0NYX0GI,hi everyone Oh theny no tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new deafheaven album ordinary corrupt human love deafheaven is a San Francisco rock band on their fourth full-length album over here if you are familiar with deafheaven you already know that their claim to fame is a pretty unique and anthemic blend of genres like black metal and scream oh and shoegaze genres that prior to the band's breakout record sunbather seemed like they were in completely different solar systems but actually had more common ground than we thought these respective rock styles came together in a very triumphant set of songs on that record transcending genre boundaries cultural boundaries - this is easily one of the most popular and critically acclaimed metal albums of the decade now the band's attempts at following this album up a few years ago with new Bermuda I found personally to be kind of underwhelming a kind of lackluster sequel that featured tons and tons of cliched post-rock passages that had already been done to death by third wave bands like explosions in the sky and every other band that has directly copied explosions in the sky so on that record I kind of found that deafheaven were punching under their weight I was hoping they would come back with a vengeance on this new album over here and it seemed like the band was really gonna come back with a vengeance on this one pull out all the stops considering that some of the teaser tracks were pretty good that the record contains an hour of material a lot of the tracks on this thing rolling past ten minutes in length so even though I went into this thing hoping and expecting deafheaven to really go above and beyond I actually think this is their worst album yet and the band really truly does put their worst foot forward with the opening track you without end which is aesthetically the worst combination of ideas I've heard all year one super plain and cheap synth piano arpeggios cheesy glam guitar soloing the band's typical retched vocals which the performance of are okay but in this instrumental backdrop sound completely out of place the overly triumphant chord progression the generic post-rock passages the ridiculously melodramatic spoken-word bits on this thing all of that combined with the seven-minute runtime of this song makes it absolute torture deafheaven was once an exciting band because of their ability to creatively bring together these seemingly different genres of music in such a way where their combination seems seamless and also through their production through their compositional abilities displayed a deep and passionate knowledge for these respective styles of music - now they're presenting as the opening track of this record is just a corny combination of popery pastiche just lazily slapped together and expecting the audience to just drool over it because well what a bunch of weird quirky stuff we never heard on the same track before why thankfully the following cuts aren't nearly as much of an aesthetic nightmare the song honeycomb has a pretty strong start anthemic chord progression lots of dramatic drums which fit very nicely against the band's very abrasive and black metal inspired vocals the wintery reverb surrounding the guitars the track eventually undergoes some very harmonious and intense instrumental build ups there's a shift where the guitars take on more of an indie rock tone it's all pretty fantastic except for the tepid post-rock outro of the song that lasts about three minutes and change it's so drab it makes me forget that this style of music was once a creative hotbed in the rock underground I pretty much feel the same way about the tepid post Rock intro of the next track canary yellow which honest to god just sounds like jangly guitar elevator music eventually this transitions into some legitimately righteous riffs embellished with some pretty sharp little guitar leads that transition us from one guitar passage to another there's some pretty blissful black metal builds and the last leg of the track that fit surprisingly well against this guitar soloing that's a pretty reminiscent of classic rock hard rock pretty melancholy chord progression to the on and on and on we choke on vocal refrain hanging in the background at the very end of the track feels like a very conscious nod to 90s alternative rock and grunge that works in pretty well as trashy boring and basic as some of the genre fusions on this album are this last leg of this particular track is a shining example of it being done very well in the second half of the record we have a few transitional cuts that are about four or five minutes they kind of serve as breathers between the longer heavier more intense moments on the album the song near and the song night people both of which are pretty much a total bore on the album near washed out guitars post rock cliches barely audible mumbly mony faint vocals that the way that they're mixed they just kind of sound like they're at the volume of background vocals but they're legit the lead vocals the song night people actually features some vocal work from Chelsea wolf but she doesn't exactly save the track or anything like that her vocals do bring a somewhat eerie tone to the track that NIR doesn't have but it's equally as hollow the song glint however is easily the best cut on this entire album not a lull in the entire track interesting from beginning to end the gentle guitar Rock intro doesn't reek of just overdone stale post rock isms the black metal bits of the song are some of the most vicious on the entire record it's a multi-faceted epic that breezes by ten minutes it really is the biggest and brightest spot on the album and it's kind of sad that it's it's shoulder to shoulder with so many aesthetic flubs like the closing track worthless animal which is a pretty awkward closed to the album it's a pretty drab combo of atmospheric American black metal and very beige shoegaze with watery rhythm guitars soaring reverb doubt lead melodies then more uninteresting post-rock passages eventually the band does lead the listener to an explosion of guitars some kind of crescendo some kind of climax but two things at this point it's too little too late you've already bored me to tears at this point in the song and two it just feels like yet another moment of deja vu in the tracklist because as unique as deafheaven might seem on the surface for how wildly they combine different genres of rock music a lot of the songs on this thing follow a pretty typical formula on the longer cuts anyway like four songs the 10 minutes 11 minutes 12 minutes they're not that structurally adventurous yeah I don't really care for it all that much I mean some bits of some tracks are pretty cool but there's not really a whole lot here in terms of a full song that I think is just fantastic from start to finish and unfortunately since the band's last album new Bermuda the the most boring bits that permeated much of the tracklist on that record it seems like the band has only found more ways to incorporate those spots into their newest material I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well and over here next to my head is another video that you could check out hit that up or the links subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana debt heaven forever

yourself and we get kick back from that turntable lab link so so you know shout out to the new Cal U cheese cover of Kanye's paranoid that's pretty good also want to shout out the Drake BBC one fire in the booth freestyle which ain't too bad either you can have fun with both of those they are linked down there below in the description box along with all the other songs that I'm going to be going to be talking about in this week's weekly track roundup alright let's get into the worst tracks this week only a couple to mention only a couple to mention there were probably more awful tracks that dropped this week but I didn't really go out searching to it too much for music that I hated honestly so these just kind of fell in my lap honestly they are the new childish gambino songs summertime magic and feels like summer yes unfortunately I don't care for these new tracks at all I don't get what it is about an artist who they come out with a super politically charged smart track that that's really kind of making a heavy heavy social comment and then it seems like there's always this desire always this pressure to rubberband and directly in the opposite direction and just make something super I don't know surface-level and safe and boring and meaningless I mean I know that these songs have been around in the in the Gambino Canon and waiting to be released for a while so you know there's probably there's probably no kind of a huge I guess a plan or arc to it in terms of how I'm interpreting it but as an outsider as somebody who's just kind of observing this not really aware of how old and how long these tracks have been worked on it does seem like that and I don't know just from the singing to the very summery obviously and cheap instrumentals there's absolutely nothing likeable about these tracks for me they're really boring not looking forward to hearing them on a new album and if they do manage to land on the same record as this is America which they most likely will that's that's gonna be a weird transition it's gonna be kind of hard reconciling these really trashy summer summer jams being shoulder to shoulder with that track and and maybe others like it so I don't know just not really feeling these cuts at all honestly let's get into the met tracks tracks that weren't blowing me away but certainly worth worth a nod this new track from an artist who goes by the name of I believe it's believed it's a pronounced Yona Yona is an AI singer an artificial intelligence singer who was devised by the likes of multimedia artists and electronic / new producer ash Cuccia and this new song of hers art and law is not my favorite track I've heard from this AI singer project of his so far but it is still pretty cool kind of I don't know sides between IDM and spoken word and given that it's an AI singer something else entirely really very weird very strange definitely going to stimulate you if you if you're looking for something off the beaten path that's pretty cool also digging the new Webster ex track a little bit no end some awkward singing on the track here and there but still a very fun dark moody trap ballad that I thought was pretty cool next twenty one pilots who actually have a couple of new tracks out this week one titled Niko and the Niners the other other titled jumpsuits and I much prefer drum soot jumpsuit excuse me honestly you know in in the band's repertoire on these tracks it's kind of the usual blend of pop and reggae and a little bit of alternative rock in the mix too but these two cuts feel a little bit darker then their material typically is especially the the the track jumpsuit and I'm kind of liking that that new direction that new little like little smidge of edginess that we're kind of getting from twenty one pilots here definitely enjoyed these cuts more than I thought I was going to so I don't know look looking forward looking looking forward to the future I guess for these guys Tony Malina short song Smith Tony Malina is back with a two minute rager just kind of looking forward to seeing how these tracks kind of play together on his brand new album it's not a bad ballad it's pretty cool kind of lo-fi and grimy but it's cool the KU are back their first music in a while I believe the rap outfit slash record came out in 2012 I was titled sorry to bother you which is the same title of the film that is being released soon that has people talking I'm not much of a movie buff myself but I do plan on trying to see this track see this track see this film but this track though is is an interesting and grimy fusion of rock music and rap music the coup as revolutionary and politically edgy as usual kind of digging it quite a bit moving on from there this is the I guess sort of cover to the new RICO nasty single titled big dick energy after the big meme floating around the internet I'm diggin it it's kind of raw ruff not as cleanly produced as a lot of her more recent tracks and everything but for a kind of loose freestyle type track it's pretty hard anything it's pretty raw and of course Rico as usual sounds fucking nasty moving on from there Mac Miller self care brand-new track um while it didn't blow me away I think Mac Miller is sounding better going in this total I guess a pop rap very sad singsong type direction the vocals on his last full length record were super rough and did not care for them at all but it does seem like Mac has been working on his singing voice quite a bit and the results are paying off can't say that the structure of the track is is really Wow me because it is still a little drab and everything but it's it's still an improvement it's no improvement for Mac and has me along with the two tracks he released not too long ago looking forward no it was actually like three cuts wasn't it was three cuts and and they all work they weren't bad moving on from there little B options coming soon I assume this new song over here money in my spirit ooh is you know kind of a your standard downtrodden but thoughtful bass God cut that's pretty good beak Geoff barrows beak barrow of of course Portishead fame his band beak prolific his ever always dropping material they have a new track out titled the brain down which is a pretty shady and downtrodden and very eerie indie rock track with this cool drum break that sequence that's kind of sequenced over and over and over kind of cycling in a very hypnotic way kind of love the vocal harmonies the very eerie and strange and awkward vocal harmonies on this one too in a way the track kind of reminded me of liars and and these days Liars don't even really sound much like liars so I'll take it and let's get into the tracks I thought were best this week best tracks this week digging on this new track from ybm chordae a young excuse me kung phoo yeah just kind of a trap banger with a lot of very witty smart hard-hitting one-liners you know just some good wordplay a lot of personality coming from him so looking forward to him drop more dropping more material into the future because when it does come to a lot of these viral I don't know if I would even call him soundcloud but I guess SoundCloud kids he's definitely bringing a bit more lyrical substance to the table than a lot of other people cut from his cloth are so all the credit in the world to him moving on from there diggin on this new lemon twigs track they have a new record on the way of course to me lemon twigs have always sounded like I don't know a weaker Fox again or something like that I mean they certainly seem to have similar influences and everything this new track over here if you give enough is certainly a huge improvement from what I remember of their previous material it's very showy it's very dramatic it's very theatrical huge string sections but it's very quirky and cheeky and and and kind of silly like it's it sounds like the most beautiful school play you you could ever possibly witness it's it's very showy but in a fun and very playful way it's got a lot of personality to it so and in the ballad of course is really nice too looking forward to potentially talking about more of their stuff in the future because I do think that they are starting to gain a sound and a style and a persona of their own so moving on from there to this new internet track the first song from the internet that I think are really um kind of loved la-dee-da just uh great again I'll use the word cheeky fun neo soul music with I guess a bit of sass to some of the lyrics and just generally a good groove great bass line it kind of seems like instrumentally the there they're bringing a lot more table they're bringing a lot more to the table than they used to so I'm kind of liking that improvement and yeah just kind of hoping to see them going to some interesting places next metric Dark Saturday metric another group I'm not usually a big fan of I've come out with a new single and it's like easily one of the weirder and edgier tracks they've come out with so far and yet it is still supremely catchy and straightforward I would honestly describe this song is like a fusion of the Yeah Yeahs and the cars like if you could take the the pop sensibilities and the the straightforward kind of New Wave synth pop or you know just say New Wave vibe of the cars and and kind of bring that grime eNOS of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and there's some moments or the vocals even kind of feel a little carreño ish that this would essentially be the result and you know it seems like they're kind of where and their influences on their sleeves on this one but I think metric has has long been in need of a change of pace because I think artistically they painted themselves into a corner they have sucked you know any in all of the the the danger in edge that could have possibly been in their music in the first place just totally out of the equation on their last record and it's interesting to hear them in a much more raw but still incredibly catchy fashion on this new track over here so kudos to them kudos to them moving on from their jpg mafia has this new track out this new Backstreet Boys inspired track out this millennium freestyle which it's a little all over the place structurally but it is very fun it is very entertaining I do like the Backstreet Boys references on the track and the the singing is on point the lyrics are on point it's very nutty and off-the-wall and just shout out to Peggy damn Peggy moving on from their igloo ghost has a new song out that I am pretty smitten with it's definitely one of his weirder and more adventurous tracks in a while it's called clear to me I hope that I'm saying that correctly and he described it as a rap song that is in a made-up language which I know just on the surface sounds really weird and pretentious and and maybe for the first verse of the song it certainly feels that way it's a little off-putting especially with the music video being as strange as it is but after the song sort of transitions in this gorgeous instrumental passage which is absolutely stunning I think what conceptually a glue was trying to shoot for with the vocals and the the sort of gibberish lyrics and everything sort of really kind of comes to pass and make sense and it actually starts to work and sort of improved kind of the first leg of the track for me once it kind of clicked with me I guess yeah it's a pretty interesting track definitely sees him experimenting more obviously with vocals and obviously with the lore behind the whole igloo ghost musical concept but then on top of that there especially with that instrumental passage in the middle and then the different vocal sections of the track it sees him really kind of experimenting with structure a bit too so I'm kind of really liking the direction of this track I don't know if I'd want him to sort of do this sort of thing on every single new song that he's got coming out but it's certainly cool to see him kind of get different tools in his to toolbelt kind of diversify his whole his whole his whole deal moving on from there yes yes yes not yes yes yes the honey has stopped him is the title of this track stop him honey has this new record or rather a song out via Rough Trade records it's a an anti-trump song obviously but it kind of calls back to the old school of very awkward politically charged socially aware female fronted post-punk music that has kind of a I'll say a quaint pop edge to it I just kind of like the vibe the song I think the lyrics are kind of straightforward you know very very much sloganeering but still enjoyable and to the point and there's kind of like the endearing quality of the song and let's see what else do we have here oh yeah the new Denzel Curie track Cobain yeah it's just a melodic trap banger with some great vocal performances from Denzel great production on this thing - it's not quite as hard and as aggressive as some people might be used to as far as Denzel goes but I do think he is trying to pay more attention to melody trying to be more aware of hooky er choruses and that sort of thing and he's certainly uh trying his best at doing that on this song over here and I think it works and I think still especially with the music video here he definitely makes a statement when it comes to influence idle idolization the the the power of mainstream media and basically a people sort of putting artists they admire up on a pedestal copycatting that sort of thing so check it out don't miss it and ooh daughters are back I was pretty high I think this is the last one yeah it's the last one I was pretty hype to talk about this track over here because daughters if you were unfamiliar with the experimental rock band years ago like I think around when I was starting the needle drop I think my review of their last album might still be up on YouTube they came out with this swan song album and disappeared off the face of the planet and you know is just really unfortunate because that record is heavy and hard-hitting as fuck I believe I likened some of the guitar tones on album to just like machinery just like crushing your head or some shit because again the tone of the instrumentation on the thing it's one of a kind it's a crazy sound it's insane and this is your song over here of theirs it's great to hear them come back it's great to hear them experimenting once again and trying something new still after all these years because this track is a really like long winded meditative patient song with a lot of different passages on it's like a 7-minute monster which is unusually long for daughters you know earlier on like their stuff was super frantic and in tents and just very I'll use the word brief but then they kind of developed a little bit on their last record and now it seems like they've they've kind of taken from where they've left off on their last album because even though that album was very aggressive it was noticeably darker than their previous material and it seems like they're getting even darker even more despondent on this new cut over here which I will make you aware of the title Satan in the wait is the title of this new track I just kind of digging the very long patient I guess the other word I'll use is unsettling direction that this new material is going in and that has been the weekly track roundup for this week everybody I hope you got some good recommendations out of this video again all the music that I talked about is down there in the description box you can check it out there and love you love you love you Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever 
RIf2tJqrGXI,arrey hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for a review of the new florence and machine album hi as hope this is the 4th full-length album from singer and songwriter florence welch and company back once again i'm sure for a gallant display of art pop chamber pop with maybe a touch of piano rock on the side if you remember the band debuted with a pretty explosive album that put quite a bit of attention on them right away they have been pretty consistent with the quality of their work since then i enjoyed their last full length album quite a bit how big how blue how beautiful however despite the incredibly catchy songs and vibrant production and somewhat electrifying performances on this record i did walk away somewhat underwhelmed because the record overall did feel kind of one-dimensional the instrumentation on this album I would call it persistently grand Florence as well always feeling like vocally she's firing on all cylinders it would have been nice if the band on this record appreciated just maybe a bit more restraint and they certainly find that restraint on high as hope I guess the question is whether or not it really kind of fits their style this thing is 10 tracks around 40 minutes pretty much all of the songs on this thing fit in to Florence and machines usual stylistic wheelhouse except for the instrumentation the songs and a lot of the lyrics on this thing sounding much sadder take the slow and somber introduction of the record June where Florence can be heard pontificating over these really authoritative piano chords almost like she's a Patti Smith or a Joni Mitchell type figure eventually the instrumentation swells into a giant and amazing wall of instrumentation and vocal harmonies it reaches this Kate Bush level of grandiosity it's a stunning start to the record it transitions very smoothly into the track hunger an excellent single which really builds the album's momentum up it features this really soft glassy instrumental introduction as many other tracks on this album do almost sounding like something off of a Julia halter record this track eventually builds into this gigantic swaying piano rock tune huih I got Wow we are God it's a soaring passionate ballad that will most certainly get the Stevie Nicks fans like pulling their lighters out then things on the record slow down very quickly on the track South London forever it's a somewhat interesting song for the band I mean I don't care for the pacing it's very meditative it's very meandering the vocal melody seemed like kind of off the cuff like they're coming out of Welch and a stream of consciousness the instrumental is very linear progressively gets more and more intense the track sort of seems like it's mostly being guided by the lyrics and the narrative and the story as well ters kind of singing about these nostalgic moments earlier in her life as it sounds like Florence and the Machine were in their more formative years the dark and pensive big God isn't a bad cut on the album either I appreciate the pain of the love that Florence is singing about on this song kind of being of religious proportions it does have a very large and impressive instrumental build even if the progression to get to that point is a little tedious even though tracks like this one and grace do take a softer a quieter approach volume wise the difference between this LP and previous Florence efforts feels like it's still only skin-deep because even if there is more personal introspective and dejected lyricism on this record this album still feels like no less of an attempt to create these very regal showy overblown pop songs which might have been improved with a better structure and just Meteor backing instrumentation like the song Patricia easily one of my favorite cuts here 100 years has certainly the biggest and the greatest instrumental climax on the entire record again even if the progression to get to that point is a little tedious especially with the very rustic stomping and clapping percussion all over the cut which is cute at first but then after a while it just feels a little awkward of all the quieter and subtler cuts on this record the best of them actually come toward the very end the song the end of love creates a very intimate atmosphere with some piano strings vocals and vocal harmonies and the song no choir as short as it is is actually an excellent finish to this album because it's pretty the records modus operandi with florence singing about how she's been having a hard time writing about happiness and happy moments in her life because she finds happiness to be so uneventful this track actually features some of my favorite lyrics on the entire LP and tomorrow it's all over at least we had it for a moment oh darling things seem so unstable but for a moment we were able to be still and there will be no grand choirs to sing no chorus will come in no Ballad will be written this will be entirely forgotten again a very wonderful moment of finality on the record that kind of explains the LPS very moody demeanor even though I do think there was a midpoint on this album that hit a little bit of a lull I still think this is a very lavish poetic and very lovesick art pop record given that it is Florence and the Machine you are getting the typically high-quality level of not only production but also just singing the album has a very strong start very strong finish more hits than misses in terms of song quality the pacing of a few tracks could have been better a few songs and I think maybe we're a tad too wordy with Florence taking a more journal like approach to her lyricism on this one it didn't blow me away but I still think it's pretty quality album I'm feeling aged strong six to a light seven on this one transition have you given this thing a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another

FXvu9BHKG4Y,Kikki do you love me are you driving yeah every weenie when I went to Kiki do you love me are you driving hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a list where I go over what I felt were the 15 best albums of 2018 so far of course these albums are listed in no particular order we will link and list all of them down there in the description box so you can see reviews for all of them too and yeah let's go Wow first let me shout out the brand new Death Grips album year of the snitch an incredible release for the experimental hip hop trio although it is like their least hip hop album yet with the band embracing elements of experimental rock and jazz rock and krautrock and electronic music Drum & Bass of course the group's very grim dark and internet-based aesthetic is still alive and well the lyrics are really exciting and cryptic the production very organic and thrilling don't really have too many bad things to say about this record it's it's honestly kind of growing on me as one of the band's best and yeah yeah yeah yeah next the new Sophie record oil of every Pearl Zhun insides a really diverse off-the-wall and absolutely insane art pop record really awesome to sort of see Sofie undergo this fantastic artistic transition into I guess a more formal experimental pop icon as opposed to a somewhat obscure electronic music producer I would love to hear a release at some point into the future that's maybe a bit more stylistically focused or something that has a more cohesive flow to it but all the material on this thing respectively is really really bold adventurous and inventive so if you want to hear art pop record that really rides the fringes then do not miss out on this one of course I have to give a nod to the Kanye West Kid Cudi collaboration kids see ghosts oh my god oh my god this thing is incredible this thing is fantastic it's fire track four track four track Kid Cudi and Kanye West over really amazing and cutting-edge production truly bring out the best in one another putting out their best material in a pretty long time no doubt I will be celebrating this record throughout the rest of this year and pretty hardcore at the end of the year too so yeah next the new Judas Priest album fire power amazing fantastic heavy metal record definitely going to be the heavy metal album of the year and definitely one of the better heavy metal records of the decade - the band really is like back in peak form on this album not only is the production great the performances are excellent Rob Halfords voice sounds amazing the guitar solos are pretty slick - nearly every song on this thing is fire it's just really excellent to hear one of the pioneers of heavy metal music continuing to do the genres so much justice and and show that there's still gas left in the tank there's still gas left in the tank next Kanye West's most personal vulnerable and harrowing album yet yeh might not be as tight hard-hitting and straightforward as push a tease Daytona which is also one of the very good albums this year or as exciting and as experimental as kits eCos but still a very formidable release I think one of the more interesting records in Kanye's discography will most likely go down as one of the more underrated albums he's ever released most likely because it is so short most likely because it's it's not packed full of hits but for those listeners who are trying to embark on a truly personal and in dark and somewhat disturbing experience with Kanye West through his mindset at this point in time this album is a must listen regardless of how critics and fans interpret this album down the road I think this record is surely going to be a mark of a very interesting point in Kanye West's career because it seems like the more volatile and the more unfiltered he gets both in his music and on social media the less people are kind of taking to him in a way and that doesn't go just for this record but also the life of Pablo so it'll be interesting to see if from here does Kanye West continue to get more artistically unhinged and experimental does he knock down even more boundaries I mean yes while yeah is is one of his more meager releases that just you know seven tracks and twenty minutes and change I would like to believe that there is more where all of this came from on some kind of future larger release and given that it's Kanye West there's really no predicting what direction that record is gonna go in next I want to shout out the u.s. girl's album in a poem unlimited surely the most diverse and versatile indie and art pop album you're gonna hear this year singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Megan Remy really does cover all the bases on this thing from pop rock to alternative dance to like disco psychedelic pop and neo psyckadeli about her standout voice and very sharp songwriting ties the entire album together even if it does seem like the the flow and the tracklist is a little all over the place even though this album lacks a central voice of sorts there are so many other quality aspects to it that it can't go ignored and it's it's it's just so sticky it's such a sticky album next the latest record from the UK jazz outfits sons of Kemet your queen is a reptile with just a couple of horns a couple of drummers a few guest vocalists here and there these guys stir together one of the most exciting jazz releases of the year hands down sure while it's not incredibly complex compositionally and there's not a lot of melodic layers to it or anything like that the solos the type performances the intense and amazing grooves throughout this record are electrifying and it may have a lot to do with the tone of the instrumentation but there's certainly something about the the music on this record that reminds me of of southern jazz music in America specifically to the New Orleans area but of course that mixed with this very dark cutting edge UK jazz aesthetic so it's really a sweet and an interesting in a smart mix of different jazz styles and sounds great playing production and chemistry all around pretty versatile record - as they dip their toes into a few different musical styles here and there so jazz heads please take note excellent album give it a listen don't miss it next I really enjoy the new Kelly youichi's album isolation and it's funny going into this record I didn't really anticipate I would like it all that much I haven't personally found Kelly to be all that strong of a vocalist on past efforts but upon listening to this entire album I found a kind of weird amateurish endearing funky attitude about the way she goes about things I also thought the pillowy and dreamy aesthetic which usually turns me off on other records actually comes through quite well on this release also thought the production was pretty excellent some of the guest stars added quite a bit to the album and I liked all the bases that she covered on this album - you know everything from vintage vocal pop to Latin pop and more I'm hoping that this album is just kind of the beginning for Callie because I mean she's coming together with great songs great aesthetics it's very artful it's a very catchy very sensual sexy record that I'm enjoying quite a bit and yeah just looking forward to more next it's one of the most experimental and adventurous rock records of the decade in my opinion and that is Jack White's boardinghouse reach never expected an album like this from Jack personally he's always been somebody who has very much made it clear that in many respects he is a traditionalist he is one who kind of keeps the torch lit for the past and very much stays and sticks within that hip-hop that garage rock that sometimes psychedelic very bluesy wheelhouse doesn't really step too far outside of it especially in his solo career thus far and now he's like totally just busted all of those walls down with this new album over here embracing elements of hip-hop music electronic music and more avant-garde music as well and mixing that of course so with you know those usual baselines of Blues and and garage rock and so on and so forth so it's not too alien it's not too separate from stuff Jack has done in the past but still it's it's it's a brand new day it's a brave new world it's a whole new era clearly for Jack and his music and hopefully this record is the mark of a very interesting future for him because honestly I feel like Jack has been punching under his weight quite a bit since the demise of the White Stripes I mean he's still at a point in his career where he should be challenging he should be pushing envelopes he still should be putting out his boldest and most interesting material maybe for some fans boardinghouse reach was a little too much too quickly considering how much Jack has built up a certain level of expectations and predictability in his discography so far I feel like a release like this he has been kind of holding back on for a while but I'm glad it's finally here I'm glad it is as in-your-face and unapologetic as it is and in my opinion this this is what rock music needs right now it needs more people willing to kind of step out of their comfort zone experiment try new things and an update the freakin genre so that it it functions and serves a purpose in 2018 next the new Natalia for COD album uses volume 2 of course this is the second installment of music that she has released in the past couple of years where she's taking a pretty much acoustic approach to going back and revisiting rewriting repurposing but also creating some original material within the Mexican Foulke and I guess greater South American folk music tradition the guitar playing is amazing her voice is fantastic the songs are romantic gorgeous beautiful and inspiring this thing is so sweet it is so wonderful it is so gorgeous it's so classy I want to give this album a hug cuz this album is so cute I got to give a shout-out to probably my favorite electronic music album so far this year against all logic 2012 2017 obviously some material for a period of five years that Nicolas Jarrah electronic music producer Nicolas char had been working on from 2012 2017 and he's releasing it under a different name entirely and I'm kind of just loving his usual micro house aesthetic but under the against all logic name there are groovier baselines there's a lot more sampling involved to the instrumental progression of these tracks is amazing and keeps these songs engaging from start to finish again for me this album it's it's very much about the grooves I'm addicted to them on this album it's an addiction I want to shout out the new portal album as well an amazing technical experimental and avant-garde death metal album best production the band has shown so far on a release the compositions on this thing are amazingly technical and dizzying to the sound is is enveloping its soul-crushing it's so dark the spans whole deal it's like really from another realm it's like another dimension next the new MGMT album little Dark Age the duo really bounces back on this thing with a kind of nostalgic magog ik synth pop album heavily inspired by the works of ariel pink I think tunes are fantastic production is fantastic it's a little bit of a departure from the usually psychedelic neo psych aesthetic that MGMT shoots for again a little bit darker a little bit goth or a little bit more New Wave but still I mean the talent is still there the songwriting is still there the great ideas are still there at the time I said this is easily their best release since like congratulations and it might actually be my favorite of theirs so far in general so it's really awesome to hear MGMT still putting out amazing work still at an artistic peak and just kind of makes me more excited for their work into the future hey everyone I was putting the finishing touches on this video and then I remembered that I forgot to talk about the new parking courts album wide-awake also one of my favorite albums of the year awesome mix of post-punk and garage rock and the like and a lot of very political lyrics on the record to that I like quite a bit the band's smartest record today I think their most consistent and ambitious as well very fun and very smart listen kicks ass and yeah yeah you out of this record and finally damn pagi jpg mafia with veteran my my first I think loved album this year that was those the first record I think I gave a super positive review to in 2018 and it has still stuck with me hardcore throughout the rest of the year I've only grown to love even more the incredibly off-the-wall experimental and adventurous production on this thing Peggy's incredible wit his comedic charm and some of the tracks on this thing is is very in-your-face aggressive and over-the-top personality and even though this is an underground record Peggy very creatively borrows a lot of ideas and concepts and and hooks from the mainstream and kind of reappropriation sort of turns them into a grimy er more adventurous and I guess a less dumb down experience it's like he borrows these trashy lowest-common-denominator ideas and it actually makes them kind of smarter while also displaying this completely ridiculous attitude that I kind of can't get enough of it's amazing to hear the more underground wing of the hip-hop genre is still putting out incredible records in the latter part of the decade hopefully that continues all the way until the end and hopefully we hear from Peggy again soon before the decades over to and that is going to be it those are my favorite albums of 2018 so far in no particular order again all those albums are listed and reviews linked down there in the description box check out any of these records that you haven't listened to yet or maybe you slipped by you because I promise you I guarantee you they are most definitely worth a shot worth your time hopefully you get some great recommendations out of this and transition have you given all of these

provbgYpk5o,hi everyone a literal two-year-old here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new zeal and ardour album stranger fruit zeal and ardour is a musical project masterminded by Switzerland native Manuel Gunn you who started turning heads with this project in the spring of last year with his band camp release devil is fine which caused a pretty big stir because of the album's unique blend of black metal and slaves spirituals and the mix of these two genres for zeal and our doors more than just aesthetic deep as it's even a lyrical and a narrative combination to take an older track like blood in the river for example which features some of the terminology surrounding religion and struggle that you typically find in spirituals but there are also some very dark notes of lyricism and just outright blasphemy in the song too because of this mix of genres zeal and our doors easily one of the most unique metal projects to crop up this decade however that devil is fine record as interesting as it was I think it did leave a little to be desired in terms of execution the recording was a little rough and these two seemingly different genres weren't blended as seamlessly as they could have been I was kind of hoping these issues would be resolved on stranger fruit and on this album that pretty much happens I would say Manuel works pretty effectively to deepen the ties between these two styles of music especially with devilish stoppers like row row or the incredibly shocking harrowing and traumatic don't you dare a track that seems to be about somebody undergoing some kind of mental or physical torture and that person is under the threat of death if they are to look away from what somebody is forcing them to experience given the theme in the background of this project the victim of this treatment could possibly be enslaved I don't know but there's also a vocal clip at some point in the track about human sacrifices most likely it's a column a column B situation because a lot of the time it just seems like these two worlds are being evenly blended to juxtapose images of God and the devil beasts a grim picture of the raw and actual savagery of man but also some references to the otherworldly via cult I mean I shouldn't be too surprised that a project like this exists in 2018 black metal has undergone quite a bit of evolution over the past decade with bands like wolves in the throne room and liturgy kind of opening up the experimental floodgates on the American wing of the genre not to mention that I think a band like Algiers isn't actually that far removed stylistically from what Zealand our door is doing I mean granted they're not a metal band but there is a similarly dark atmospheric and strange vibe to their music with their combination of post punk goth soul blues industrial of course there are purists in the mostly traditionalist black metal scene who will never take to it zeal and ardour is doing but if you're somebody who's open to this change open to this mix I think this album has a lot to offer it does have a bit of a slow start though I do like the atmospheric tone setting intro which is heavily layered with these explosive tremolo Pickett ARS forlorn vocal harmonies it sort of sounds like a black metal take on a spiritual dirge but then the following track gravediggers chants sort of feels like what could have been more of a cool-down moment in the middle of the record it's not as seamlessly blended in terms of the two main styles of music featured on this record nor is it as well structured as a lot of the other songs on here is the Finnish kind of just fizzles out I mean the sound and the performance is great the hollering vocals that Manuel works into the track are chilling to the bone lots of heavy and bombastic drums and pianos on this thing some occasional shots of guitar feedback very big powerful sounds that just trampled my head like a stampede just not one of the better Tunes on here and a really odd pick for the first leg of the album the song servants is a sharper and more exciting blend of the two genres and forming most of this record you have these bellowing howling hollering again expressive lead vocals singing and delivering all of this familial terminology but mixing that with symbolism of death and a red horse and it seems like as we get deeper into the lyrics singing about being servants and joining us it's kind of almost as if this song is just about worshipping Satan over another explosive wall of black metal guitars event these guitars mixed with some very sweet like ooh vocal harmonies that turn kind of sour and demented for an incredible finale I know on the surface that the way I'm describing this might sound totally ridiculous like these two genres together in the same record it can't possibly work together but I think Manuel does a fantastic job of exposing the inherent darkness and mournful tone of spiritual music that pairs well with black metal so I think there was natural common ground there that a lot of people weren't really aware of prior but clearly Manuel is putting in a lot of effort to get these two genres in the same room together I mean the way the black metal guitars work together with the lead vocals at the start of don't you dare is actually really surprising you could call with zeal and our doors doing a gimmick but really only in the sense that so few people are doing it and it just seems like such a novelty but the actual result the actual product delivered on this record is incredibly detailed menacing and pretty inspired - I love the thrilling and blistering fire of motion definitely a high intensity point on the album which is matched really well with the ambient ish interlude the hermit one of a few transitional tracks and the track listing here which build up the the flow of the album quite a bit otherwise it would be much more one-dimensional these fusions of black metal and spirituals continue onto the song Row Row where Manuel is still finding new and interesting and subtle ways to kind of bring these worlds together which i tribute greatly to the performance and production aspects of this record while sure the vocals are clearly inspired by slave spirituals there's also kind of an aggressive gruff roaring quality to them - that doesn't feel that far removed from a metal song meanwhile the production while it is heavy it is hard-hitting it's not too squeaky-clean it's not too sequence it's not too sanitary or touched up or anything like that there is a bit of rawness to it that I think is natural and necessary for this style of music I wouldn't call the guitar playing or the drumming all that flashy either it's very good it's very solid I think the magic of a lot of these songs actually comes from the layering the pacing the overall composition these tracks the transitions that Manuel puts these songs through as they move from section to section the way he changes upward progresses sections of songs that you might have heard already by adding different vocal harmonies or changing guitar parts or drum parts it's all very well assembled there's also the song ship on fire which changes things up because there are a few points at which it incorporates these eerie Latin chants as we get into the second half of the record I will say the album does falter a tad the song waste for the most part in the intro has this very boring 2 chord progression and some vocal riffing that for whatever reason doesn't so much sound like it's inspired by the same spiritual music that a lot of the previous tracks were rather the singing on this track just kind of comes off like that of like a bad alt metal or post-grunge song I kind of got the same vibe from the singing on the track built on ashes the closure of this album we are like this close away from like a Scott Stapp impression I swear still the instrumental atmosphere on both of these tracks is pretty terrifying there are some other experiments and variations in the second half of this record that do go over much better though the song we can't be found is the only cut that blatantly incorporates some thrash metal riffing into the zeal and ardour equation with more eerie vocal harmonies and more chilling chants the song you ain't coming back is another attempt at a heavy soulful ballad turned out much better than gravediggers chant in my opinion it really is a powerful moment on the album and an exceptional song about death trauma and letting go also Manuel sings some shivering and sweet falsettos on this track two that are amazing meanwhile the song the fool is a surprising serene synth scape in the midst of the album because why not it's a softer and more endearing moment on the record it does provide a nice breather and even though it is a very big aesthetic change the compositional style of this song is is very romantic which always works against a black metal backdrop we have another synth track not too much later on the song solve but it's a much shorter kind of seem as redundant at this point I feel like this breather we could have used earlier so it would have broken things a bit more meanwhile the song stranger fruit the title track takes things in in almost an industrial direction with these heavy booming drums and piano notes it feels almost Nine Inch Nails inspired and if you are at all familiar with the origin of the song strange fruit you can pretty much put two and two together as to what the horrors of this song are about now as cool as the song coagula sounds it's still kind of a weird vocal chantey one minute detour that I don't think adds that much to the tracklist thing like I wish this musical bit was somehow incorporated into maybe a larger song or something and I've already kind of stated my piece on the final track I still don't really like the lead vocals of it even though I do like the lyrical sentiment the instrumental backdrop and the whole dying alone refrain like it is a very dark at a very final message to leave this album off with so I will say two things overall that are a bit of a slight against this album I still don't think all the kinks all of the wrinkles have been kind of smoothed out on this new record and as good and as varied and as thoroughly entertaining as this record is I wonder if there's really another album in Zeeland ardour I mean there's always the chance that he can reinvent this sound once again but he went pretty deep into the rabbit hole on this one and I wonder how much deeper it goes one more thing I'll say is that I wish the album had a stronger start and a stronger finish but outside of all of that this is an incredibly well produced well-written creative trailblazing album what Manuel is doing on this record is so off the beaten path I doubt that there will be many other artists who are kind of following in his footsteps on this record but regardless I'm still very happy that this incredibly unique music release happened because it's great it's an experience that I'll never regret and it shows just how much potentially unexplored territory there is in the realm of music I'm feeling a light too decent 8 on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it

GXcTZuZbiOE,hi everyone all my Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Carter's album everything is love jay-z and Beyonce the Carters they are back with a new full-length collaborative album which they dropped in the middle of last month kind of piqued my interest around the time especially given that J and B are responsible for a few of my favorite albums over the past few years 444 and lemonade both of which were each artists most personal and vulnerable albums to date also going pretty deep into the relationship issues that they were suffering through at the time which kind of made for an interesting soap opera for fans and on this new album of theirs I was kind of hoping that the Carters would continue on this thoughtful semi conceptual and emotionally in tune trend but unfortunately everything is love does no such thing instead this album is kind of like a less interesting watch the throne it's extravagant it's out of touch and it's occasionally awkward - I mean the whole thing starts off well enough with the song of summer which is a sexy and lavish celebration of jay-z and Beyonce's love for one another set to some very ritzy and soulful organs and guitar and drums Beyonce likening her love for jay-z to an ocean it's sweet it's deep the track gets prettier and more luxurious as it goes along and while jay-z's verse on the track is cute it's endearing it's really Beyonce's incredibly sensual vocals that sell the whole thing and while again this is a pretty good start to the album actually has me looking forward to the entire thing it doesn't take very long for this record to take a nosedive on the track ape shit I mean some of the jay-z lines on here pretty sharp like the Chief Keef Rafiki you know who's your Lion King line is pretty great but like with some of the tracks on Magna Carta Holy Grail trying to fit jay-z into some of these more modern traps stylings is kind of just an awkward fit and when you add Beyonce into the mix it's just two times as awkward especially with her lyrics on this track being some of the most boring or ridiculous on the entire record unintentionally hilarious I pretty much feel the same way about the song nice it's kind of like this slow off-kilter detune trap banger it's weird it's woozy but jay-z kind of raps on top of it like it's any other beat I can't help but feel like this instrumental would have been so much greater had a rapper who was maybe a bit more left-field do something just a bit riskier on top of it all so that ennum nice nice nice nice nice nice nice refrain that he does on this drag is just absolutely ridiculous the track is kind of the polar opposite to apeshit in that it's Beyonce who actually sounds like she's saving the track even with that kind of odd execution of a half-baked reference on the first verse her second round on the track goes so much better I guess Pharrell had his hand in both of the beats on these tracks - I mean it's some of his most lackluster production in a while doesn't even have that trademark Pharrell sound which i think would have complimented jay-z and Beyonce better stylistically the song boss feels a bit more in jay-z and Beyonce's wheelhouse it's contemporary but allows both of them to exist in that rich and braggadocious mid-paced bling era headspace that they both came up in it's classy it's wrapped in these sweet vocal harmonies lots of rich pianos and big horn hits - it sounds real expensive though the jabot other rappers who are really prideful and jay-z's verse doesn't quite make sense because it seems like he's also exemplifying that same kind of pride in his own lyrics just because other rappers kind of want to pave their own way do their own thing try to be their own boss even if they don't end up succeeding the song 7 1 3 is kind of another highlight on here it hits hard it's definitely one of the catchy er tracks but I do think a lot of its appeal kind of boils down to what jay-z and beyonce borrow from the dr. Dre song still from the hook - the kind of plinky pianos and the instrumental which aren't the same but it sounds like they were kind of inspired I mean this track is definitely better than a lot of the other cuts on here where jay-z and Beyonce are just trying so hard to sound hip but I'm just kind of convinced as to why jay-z and Beyonce are going this far to illustrate like yeah we're putting it down I mean who are they trying to convince because it just kind of seems like a logical inconsistency that jay-z and Beyonce go to such great lengths to hoist themselves up high kind of portray themselves as gods whose mere presence is a gift to us mere mortals but hey they're also like down-to-earth they're grassroots they're organic the song friends a kind of sad slow pretty weekend influenced R&B slow jam about how the Carters friend group is is really really small okay so they're not making any new friends I'm not really seeing what's so interesting about that because typically when a rapper writes a song in this style you kind of get these themes of trust and paranoia that pour through really strongly in the lyrics and the vibe of the song but it's just not here for the most part it just kind of sounds like they're not making new friends because they're pretentious which the song heard about us just oozes with pretentiousness to the point where I just can't even stomach it also that calling me Dad kiddingly line like Jesus Christ it's it's the internet dude it's the Internet the song black affect is certainly a highlight for me on this record I like the sharp smart and sassy Afrocentric lyricism throughout the track love the references to MLK Boulevard and Malcolm X I love jay-z and Beyonce's energy together on this song this is one of the few cuts here where it sounds like they are literally performing and executing this track together singing together rapping together trading bars together bouncing off of and complementing one another there are few other songs on this album where it seems like jay-z and Beyonce are this closely woven into one another which is kind of a shame I wish we could have heard more cuts executed like this on this album the song love happy is kind of an assuring finish to the album for those who might have been wondering hey I mean I knew you guys like romantically are you still okay it's one of the more extravagant and soulful instrumentals on the record beyonce kind of insists that the ups and downs of jay-z and her relationship but is is worth it it doesn't really seem like a significant proclamation of love or a renewal of vows or anything like that it seems mostly kind of like a pat on the head for the audience who just might have been curious if things are okay overall I'm very happy that jay-z and Beyonce have been able to move past their relationship woes and get a collaborative record together but the final result over here is very inconsistent it's very spotty it's pretty underwhelming it feels like it mostly relies on its star power to garner interest in itself much of which has dissipated since the release of this album there's not a whole lot in terms of like essential material on this record for either artists and generally I just don't really see the hype I'm kind of feeling the light too decent five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a comment in the comments if you're feeling full of thoughts or over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana jay-z Beyonce the Carters everything is love forever 
aRSdeuF9qiE,ah hi everyone wreaths in each right a know the Internet's busiest music nerd here and it's time for a review of the new Teyana Taylor album keep that same energy actress singer model Teyana Taylor releasing a new 8 track album as a part of this Kanye good music summer series I'm not really that familiar with Taylor's kind of spotty musical release schedule up until this point I know she's had a few releases under her belt some singles some very notable high level features with the likes of Meek Mill and Ben staples and of course the good music camp she just seems like a person with a lot of irons in the fire and music just happens to be one of them and I feel like that lack of a focus and priority on music is reflected at least a little bit in this new project over here unfortunately every once in a while Taylor's vocals on this thing do hit a very raspy and a passionate high that makes for a great moment but her singing chops on this record aren't that show-stopping nor is her voice all that distinct either that and keep the same energy feels like one of the more cobbled together good music records to come out this summer too some of the songs on this thing don't really have as much in the way of flow or structure they're kind of like so-so motifs that stir up a kind of decent vibe not really doing so much that they impress but not doing so little that they offend either I think the opening cut no manners is a prime example of this and while there are some really stunning horn samples and vocal samples and and strings on this cut all of it kind of outshines Taylor she drowns in the grand musical entrance that the album makes rather than hitting us with a voice that is as powerful as the instrumental presentation here she just kind of goes for average however I will say there are some highlights on this record gonna love me is a wonderful song of love and devotion fit very snugly against the sweet electric guitar licks a bouncy beat and this chillingly beautiful Delfonics vocal sample it's got this awesome classic soul modern R&B seamless mix going on it comes together really well I mean not only is this track one of the in the tracklisting here but also it serves as a reminder that there just aren't enough songs and albums in this genre that make use of samples so creatively I would actually say this track is one of the few moments where her lyricism actually shines - singing sometimes I don't think we say enough why is it so hard to keep in touch when we're laying right next to each other baby Taylor singing in this song not about a new or exciting or super sexy relationship but more about the grim reality of of having a hard time keeping up intimacy and interest in a long-term relationship something that I don't think is explored enough in songs like these another highlight for me on the record was Rosen Haarlem another song whose chilling beauty can be greatly attributed to the production especially that vocal sample Rosen um it's kind of on ting but it is also one of the few songs here where the hook is handled pretty much by Taylor not by a sample kind of popping in and doing it for her and she absolutely kills it maybe the ones she kind of puts on some Rihanna style swag for the verses on this track which are part sung part rapped a lot of bars I like on this track about struggling and aspiration and trust and betrayal and then we have issues / hold on I love the flow of her voice on this track this mix of classic old-school soul bass and guitars with like these super trippy psychedelic delayed laser scents and of course the issues that are being sung about here are personal and emotional issues daddy issues relationship trust issues going through your significant others phone being jealous of other women I also love the hold on don't let me go refrain tour the back end of the track but it is one of the few moments on here where I feel like the full potential of the song is being cut off by its brevity I wish it had a bigger climax you know I appreciate what Kanye has been trying to do with this short album series but there are a lot of artistic risks involved with putting out records like these especially in a repeated fashion and unfortunately I kind of feel like Katy se it's kind of getting the short end of the stick it's exemplifying some of the ways in which a record like this can go wrong or maybe not be awful but kind of missed the mark because the results are a little meager there are some moments on this record that I think kind of take a nosedive or are just super under well one of them being 3-way which I didn't really anticipate it shouldn't be that hard to sell the audience on sex or like one of the most popular sexual fantasies out there but for a song about threesomes this track is kind of boring not really all that descriptive the lyrics are basic as Taylor vocally seems like she's just trying to do her best weekend impression most of the time the only thing that prevents this song from being a total throwaway is ty dolla sign's killer feature again in the song hurry we have Tiana trying to shove sensuality down the audience's throats with like these awkward faux orgasms in the middle of the cut again shooting for sexy but falling terribly short I do like the instrumental but Kanye's a verse on the track doesn't really do much to save it either the song never would have made it I think is the only track in here which is billed as featuring production solely from Kanye as there are quite a few co-producers on this thing and it's okay it's a sort of nostalgic 90s throwback R&B ballad it sounds kind of average in every way imaginable I do appreciate the personal and emotional sentiment of the song but it's it's not very stand out and wtp is one of the weirdest closers that I've heard this year I mean there are some things about it that I do like I love the driving dance beat I like the Micky Blanco feature overall the track seems kind of like a fusion of super early 90's hip hop and house I could totally vogue to this thing for hours but overall the track is kind of obnoxious and Taylor's vocals are one of the least interesting things in the mix once again she's being drowned out by more vibrant and more exciting sounds surrounding her it kind of leaves me with mixed feelings as an ending and the track generally just kind of seems like a giant ego stroke like watch out for me I'm going up from here this is just things getting started which it's it's not really you've been at this for a while and if this is you putting your best foot forward like it could have been better overall this thing is a decent listen it's not terrible by any stretch of the imagination but there are quite a few underwhelming parts that keep it from reaching its full potential plus I also think quite a bit of the magic on this thing does revolve around this albums collaborators and producers because if Taylor is going to become an exciting focal point of her future releases she needs to gain a more distinct voice as a songwriter lyricist and singer I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like

0Uiw2oWbKIw,hmm hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for our weekly track roundup a special holiday week edition because it was fourth of July this past week there have been that many tracks that dropped so we're gonna kind of blow through this one a little bit it's gonna be quick it's gonna be easy first shout out to the good people over at the ridge wallet they make these nifty little minimalist wallets which just kind of pop your cards in there money clip on the other side and yeah it's really nice and rockin mine for many weeks now I think maybe a month at this point and I love it it's nice in my pocket doesn't take up too much room link down below to get your own and use promo code Fantana for 10% off alright let's get into the tracks of course we have our Amazon and turntable lab associate links down there if you want to use that turntable lab link to treat yourself to a colorful pressing of a record I've reviewed or turntable audio equipment that sort of thing we get kicked back from it and let's get into the worst tracks of the week excuse me I had to clear my throat there let me clear my throat alright first Marilyn Manson has this new track out titled cry little sister it's kind of a cross between his typical style of goth rock with like a touch of a really bad new wave and hair metal it's maybe one of his most obnoxious ballads that I've heard in a while you know just think of something off with maybe Antichrist Superstar but totally intolerable I'm moving out from there Justin Timberlake he is still trying a new track out titled soul mate it's probably one of his cornea songs in a while a really cheap production - yeah after that last album he dropped I just don't know if I'm in the mood for much Justin Timberlake especially if a track is going to be this low quality and finally Iggy Azalea has a new track out featuring Tyga a titled cream they essentially hop onto the song and it's battle to see who can be more relevant pretty a generic kind of dark trap beyond this one yeah just not a whole lot to it it's uh run-of-the-mill all right the tracks that I thought were met but we're certainly worth shouting out certainly worth paying attention to first off municipal waste has a new track out titled slow I'm at punishment of course these guys are still in the in the hole I guess throw back nostalgic punk thrash hybrid camp and this new track it's it's not bad it's not terrible you know it's just a pretty average for the whole thrash revival thing but it's a fun listen it's a fun listen fun riffs you know over-the-top lyrics I'm diggin it next little pump has a new track out titled drug addicts and it's it's gotta be one of his most so-so singles in a while for a song titled drug addicts it doesn't sound very druggie little pump sounds really straight and sober on the truth frankly and if he is you know good for him you know he should be making decisions to kind of take better care of himself going forward you know a little pump he shouldn't you know fall down the drain of drug addiction and lean and drinking and all that stuff you should take care of himself the issue is though is that the beat is kind of a run-of-the-mill track beat his delivery is pretty measured not really as amped or as exciting nor are his lyrics as colorful as usual he's got a few funny one-liners in there every once in a while but she's kind of okay it's definitely not as over-the-top as so I don't know hopefully we have more boisterous singles into the future moving on from there and more at all the black metal band the black metal legends immortal new track out mighty raven dark new album is out now and it's a pretty nice piece of black metal you know it's a lengthy piece it's got a nice little cool dark mysterious instrumental in weed passage in the middle and then it kind of builds up toward the end so it's it's kind of an epic looking forward to talking about the new record a lot of the verses and music up until that transition point in the middle seemed kind of average for them the lyrics as well but um I don't know if you're just a huge black metalhead and you want to hear stuff strictly in that sound you're purist you don't you don't like to hear a whole lot of experimentation or anything like that then you know give it a shot moving on from there Ella Mae with Nicki Minaj and quavo on the boot-up remix in in some respects it just kind of sounds like an average R&B ballad but Nicki Minaj and quavo do add a little bit to the track I am interested in trying some of Ella's other stuff though there has to be more to what she's doing than simply this cut so you know I think with this song being as popular as it is as of late we'll probably be hearing more from her very soon so moving on from there the 1999 wildfire cut from Brock Hampton their brand new single I'm guessing the the new single from their forthcoming project yeah you know I wasn't too crazy about it you know it's not terrible but um I thought some of the verses on here were a little awkward especially the the Joba verse the rhythm of it seemed a little off in in some places and the hook was super like Outkast influenced the point where I feel like Brock Hampton kind of lost their their personality in it a little bit you know not a terrible song by any means I kind of get the hype and I think the production is is top-notch and Dom's verse on it I thought was very good but wasn't really you know like blow me away or anything like that just thought the execution could have been better ultimately just thought I could have had better execution but uh yeah I'm still looking forward to the new LP and I guess conceptually melodically structurally I probably preferred that falen track that dropped not too long ago I just wish I could have heard a studio version of that but I think the grander scheme of things I probably enjoy that song a bit more than than this one even though it is a studio version yeah it's pretty much my my full take on that I think still can forward to the new project just wasn't sort of blown away by this track but Brock Hampton - given us so much great music up until this point even though I'm a little underwhelmed by this still no reason not to look forward and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best not too many this week again not too many tracks first off parquet courts just dropped a kind of synth and drum machine intensive cover of the amazing Ramones song today our love tomorrow the world which I thought was absolutely excellent very fun very quirky and love that song levee original you know and then the covers cool and a little yachty who want the smoke with cardi B and offset cardi B kills it on this track not that she's super lyrical or anything like that but her personality and everything is just over the top as usual and I thought her delivery was a hilarious little gaudy was fun you know like the instrumental - I'm not gonna tell you it's a deep song or anything like that or really even that it's a reinventing the whole wing of the trap genre that that little yadi cardian offset inhabit but it is a fun track you know it is a fun track might be one of those essentials summer bangers and I am going to leave it at that that has been the very short weekly track roundup just an eight-minute one or so this time around again not because not a lot of tracks dropped this week you know it's a holiday week so I will probably have more tracks coming up this coming week remember our good people over at the Ridge link down there below in the description and I will catch you guys in the next one Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever 
w7PFQHSOmLY,ah hi everyone taki talked Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new vein album error zone this is the debut full-length album from Boston Massachusetts band vain they formed in 2013 and have built up to the release of this debut full-length record with a series of EPs and I personally was pretty hype for this new record of theirs because I thought a lot of the teaser tracks to this thing pretty fire frantic vicious metalcore music and the vein of converge or botch or just generally some some mid-2000s metalcore but with kind of a a weirdly electronic edge like maybe some drum and bass elements being worked in there or something it seemed like oddly futuristic post cyber math core something upon deeper listens to the album though this record is is not quite as ahead of the curve as I thought it would be however there is a wider array of loud rock styles going into this thing than I thought there would be initially because not only are there characteristics of metalcore and very intricate mathcore on this record too but also like some industrial music some alternative metal and new metal in the vein of like a Deftones or a Slipknot I would say that there might even be a touch of groove metal on this record too maybe the band is a little into Fear Factory even though there are numerous subgenres going into this album it's all blended pretty seamlessly into a violent flurry of throat shredding screams very groovy and jagged guitar riffs very grimy distorted bass fairly flashy drumming and plenty of breakdowns too all of this is enhanced pretty subtly with some clean vocal passages every now and again to kind of make things a tad more melodic I hear a lot of attempts on this record to kind of elevate these very harsh and occasionally basic alt metal and and metalcore sounds but now that I've heard the entirety of this record I sit here wondering if vane truly has gone far enough in that respect because the overall sound and aesthetic of this record is kind of average the guitar tone the the vocal style for metalcore music it's it's kind of dime-a-dozen to the point where if you hand this album over to a less experienced listener they might assume that this is just some kind of old metalcore record from the mid-2000s because it kind of sounds like it is even with the little bit of anachronistic genre blending that vein does because while I can hear that they are trying like their approach to these harsh music styles is nowhere near as inventive as let's say a band like Code Orange I mean transitional moments on this record like anesthesia and untitled actually do more to bring diversity to the tracklist than a lot of the core songs of this album do like old data in a dead machine tracks like the intro virus vibrance are actually incredibly freaky a supreme highlight on here as is the closing song on here quitting infinity which features these really eerie and epic sci-fi style guitar passages but throughout the middle of this record it's almost like the band intentionally tones the experimentation and their sound down to blend into much of what has already happened in alternative metal and metalcore upon closer inspection a lot of the tracks on this thing aren't really wow me even if many of them are delivered in these very aggressive straightforward and to the point 1 to 2 minute attacks there are longer moments on this album like doom Tech which clocks in at a very beefy 446 but a lot of the clean and monie vocal passages on that cut are kind of drab I would like to say vane takes a slightly more tasteful approach when it comes to copying over these elements of guitar and clean vocals straight from new metal music but it's not really that much different it still kind of sounds just like it did a decade ago and many of these artists were kind of creatively driving these sounds into the ground I can really only see the slightly different approach vain is taking to it if I tilt my head squint my eyes and just shake my head violently especially when it comes to the very edgy and melodramatic finish of doom Tech every time I close my eyes or the kind of moody piano passages that carry away underneath blaring guitars toward the latter half of the song and eternal which are barely audible don't really add that much to the mix I mean I can't entirely knock the album there are some good musical highlights on here it is a pretty tight groovy abrasive somewhat fun listen it's 20 minutes and change it doesn't stick around that long it's blunt it's kind of eccentric at points there is a baseline of good things going on on this album but so little of what's delivered is actually great and standout because a lot of the ideas that the band is reappropriation are just sort of stale at this point and they do very little to reinvent them however the recording and the execution for the most part is really good and I still kind of chalk a lot of the issues with this record up to this being the band's first release I still hear a lot of good things on here and clearly they are trying to do something at least a little different I hear that they're on a similarly experimental trajectory like that of a bands such as Code Orange so who knows where they'll be three years from now what their next album is going to sound like maybe it will be more experimental maybe it will be more adventurous I guess I'm just gonna cross my fingers here and hope that that's the case and hope that these guys eventually become an exciting new face in the metalcore genre because Jesus Christ the the genre needs it I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I our next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well and yeah that's it that's it Anthony

yP6b02-qSlA,it's just so it's so odd I'm gonna put on this yeah just to make it hotter just cuz just because hi everyone Hugh thin a mid tan oh here the internet sweatiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Kumasi washington album heaven and earth this is the latest full-length album from bandleader arranger composer saxophonist Kumasi washington who turned the world of modern jazz on its head a few years ago with the release of his triple album the epic and album that came seemingly out of nowhere the usual channels of the jazz community didn't even seem prepared for the Kumasi washington hype and the miraculous breakthrough that he had on this album with some pretty young listeners not only because of the collaborative connections that washington had with artists like Kendrick Lamar and Flying Lotus but also with his boundless and exciting approach to the genre exploring every crevice and corner that jazz had to offer dropping numbers on this album that are very much like in in a jazz funk vein then also bebop spiritual jazz Latin jazz vocal jazz jazz fusion occasionally working in some really grand walls of arranged instrumentation vocals and strings typically very much a no-no with a lot of jazz purists off of the epic Kumasi essentially made himself an exciting new face in the Jazz genre someone who can breathe new life into it while also challenging contemporaries now since the release of the epic the handful of material that Kumasi has released has has been alright a little underwhelming in comparison with his material on the epic but I still thought that whatever his next album release was going to be no doubt it was going to be bold which brings us to heaven and earth the new Kumasi Washington double album it's 2 hours and 24 minutes long and I know some people are thinking hey that's that's not as big and as long as the epic that's shorter yes while that may be true there is also a companion EP that was released along with this album with 38 additional minutes of material for those who are truly in for the long haul I'm not going to be talking about that EP in in this review but it's it's there it exists along with more originals and a cover of a child so now as far as the core album here goes like I said two discs eight tracks on each disc many of which range from about 9 to 10 minutes so still some pretty lengthy jams on this thing and while the breadth of jazz genres on this record is not quite as wide as it was on the epic I appreciate Kumasi x' efforts to kind of refine his sound on this release the 16 tracks on this album center mostly around very rich and melodic and instrumentally dense spiritual jazz occasionally with some of the backing instrumentation or solos being washed out maybe a little bit of a psychedelic delay kind of making the recording sound a little trippy and surreal sounding like the band is exploring the outer reaches of space occasionally feeling a little transcendental like it's a religious experience especially as everyone in the band is trying to create the most ruckus possible against a very intense solo sometimes with the backing chord progression ascending higher and higher and higher and higher it leads to some pretty epic points on the album like the introductory fists of fury which is not only a great start to the album a great jazz song but also a nod to the theme of the Bruce Lee movie of the same title also the finishing cut of the first disc as well one of one but outside of some shorter tracks in the track listing here and by shorter I mean like maybe in the range of 5 minutes or so most of the songs on here are pretty lengthy and what I just described earlier is pretty much the mode by which they all try to achieve this big epic gargantuan jazz goal and after a while it becomes a little much because if Kumasi and his band were going to focus this intently on the heavily arranged spiritual jazz angle I think they could have cut the runtime in this album down quite a bit because it not only takes away from the versatility the dynamics of the overall album experience but the huge influx of extra instrumentation on this thing it does kind of take away from the grooves of the core band the intensity of the solos - I mean sure while some of this stuff did end up on the epic what made moments like change of the guards so significant is that they were unique in that they were one of the few moments that kind of had that vibe had that sound they were thrilling because they stood out meanwhile on heaven and earth it seems like the sole purpose of some of the tracks here is just kind of build to the next instrumental crescendo point like on the intro track to the second disc space travelers lullaby where the mountainous instrumental build on this track just feels so huge and never-ending it's like I'm Sisyphus endlessly pushing a boulder up a hill I hear Kumasi and his band making an attempt here to create something larger than life but a lot of the time on this record their efforts become so vast that they lose their form or so dense that they lose their details like the song the invincible youth which has these really kind of watery tripped-out very muddy and cloudy psychedelic bass lines played throughout numerous passages as well as the kind of forgettable jazz guitar solo that barely kind of pops out of the very heavy mix there are also some kind of lackluster instrumental transitions on this cut to the song overall is a kind of difficult to untangle and not in like a weird experimental avant-garde way either overall there's kind of a lack of super muscular exciting groovy cuts on this record moments like the Magnificent 7 off of the epic I think heaven and earth is desperately in need of in order to kind of break up the super heavy almost monotonous and juggernaut sized jazz epics on this thing I mean the song show us the way on this record does come kind of close but it's still short by a couple of miles unfortunately for me this record is not really the artistic statement that its predecessor was and while there's not really any one track on this thing that is unbearable from start to finish this record does have its missteps the song view of each soul is one of a couple Latin jazz cuts on this thing and it features this really weird I don't know robot vocoder lead vocal sung at the beginning and the end of the track there's just absolutely obnoxious it's kind of too much to bear it sounds like something out of a bad Daft Punk song and after multiple listens I'm still just failing to see the appeal of the squelchy repetitive bassline on the track street fighter mas even if the chorus vocals and the melody of the track are incredible I still like how playful the song is generally it's very fun music video I mean the very obvious video game not here - but the musical progression of the song leaves a lot to be desired it feels kind of static it's the kind of jazz fusion that restricts the wild freewheeling improvisation that makes jazz so interesting to begin with I feel somewhat the same way about the mostly powerful will you sing the closer to the second disc and the entire album I loved nearly everything about the song except it's very static rhythm section it feels kind of restricted even if the sax soloing on this track is fire and then there are at least a few cuts on here that aren't so much blemish but maybe just mild just a lack of velocity and kind of redundant aesthetically like that cut in the middle of disc one Tiffa cone K now despite my complaints of which I guess there are many there's still plenty of highlights on this album the song testifies a standout piece of vocal jazz of which I wish there was more of on this album it's a super pretty love song it has a very rich backing instrumental palette and even though it is dwarfed by a lot of the longer tracks on this release it's a very nice heartwarming breather the song can you hear him is excellent super nimble bass line and rhythm section eventually this guides us into these really intergalactic trippy and insane synth and sax solos it's almost like something off of Herbie Hancock's extant but with a way more aggressive edge the song hub tones is equally trippy but features of course a Latin groove it is one of a few tracks though on this record that I think kind of wears out its welcome at the length that it lasts like there could have been more changes the intro could have been more eventful there could have been more solos the songs show us the way that I mentioned earlier even though I am kind of tired of the super lavish instrumentation at this point on the record at which we reach this song I do have to admit this is one of the better cuts in this style on the album the climax points on this track are incredible there are some very showy rushes of strings on this track bashing against this incredibly intense sax solo that lights my brain fire and there's also the deeply groovy the psalmist which has a beat that you just have to hear to believe you know I really wanted to love this record going into it but unfortunately I just kind of feel like it's it's okay it's decent if you're gonna put out a record this long every track has to be to some degree top notch you can't be dropping material it's just merely passing the time a record of this size really needed more variety more versatility more dynamics yes I do enjoy a lot of the themes of Afro centrosome and space and and religion on this thing but in comparison to the epic I just find this album to be so cumbersome even though it is shorter I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well if you hit that subscription button and yeah over here next to my head is another video that you can check out you can hit that up or give yourself a pat on the back for being a great person anthony Fantana Kumasi washington forever 
DPHYLnhPRqw,a hi everyone United children with their families God Dan Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new gorillaz album the now now this is the latest full-length album from the virtual band Gorillaz which of course is a masterminded by songwriter singer multi-instrumentalist producer Damon Albarn as well as an animator Jamie Hewlett and the gang is all back it's 2d it's Murdock it's Russell its noodle another guy who's like basically ace from the the Powerpuff Girls now I mean why not at this point I've never really personally been as partial to the gorillas lore as I have the virtual bands music though I understand that there are a lot of fans that feel the opposite and that's totally fine regardless I was looking forward to this new album over here quite a bit hopefully getting some redemption out of this thing considering that it was a relatively quick follow-up to their last full-length album of last year's humans easily gorillas most underwhelming release yet overloaded with super drab tracks distracting features which kind of took away from gorillas core sound it basically felt like Albarn just kind of producing a bunch of quirky instrumentals for singers and artists who he really likes generally a kind of out-of-control album it just seemed like Albarn was trying to make something that was larger than life and in the process the record just kind of got away from him and despite the kind of mixed reception this record received from fans he still want a Brit Award off of it so I mean I guess there's that so with the fact that this record was kind of billed as a change of pace from humans along with the shorter more succinct tracklist as well as the much more scant feature list I was kind of looking to this record to focus more on gorillas core sound and kind of maybe get back to basics in a way and the now now definitely does that to a degree however I'm still having a hard time actually being excited about this album now that it is right here in front of me because while this record is definitely a return to focus it's hardly a return to form because it is yet another departure away from the few heuristic and very cutting-edge blend of pop and hip-hop and electronic music and rock that gorillas have been known for up until this point instead on the now now while certainly a lot of those genres are still at play we're getting kind of a much more bland and dreamy take on them it's somewhat of a drab indulgence and very summery synth pop which was kind of clear from the first batch of singles to drop from this thing just how uniform a lot of them were in aesthetic and vibe I had a sneaking suspicion that the rest of the record would kind of follow suit and it pretty much does and maybe this shift is not really a big surprise in the grander scheme of things because a lot of Damon Albarn's recent material whether it's been his solo stuff for the last blur album has been kind of Moody I was actually surprised to hear that humans didn't follow suit in that when it dropped but now it seems like we're finally getting that melancholy on a delay with the now now and while this record definitely keeps in the guerrillas spirit by being quirkier than much of the more depressive material Albarn has released as of late it's still similarly one-dimensional in its moodiness and has a somewhat surprising West Coast aesthetic to it it's like a day at the beach but you're too sad to enjoy it I mean there are certainly a handful of highlights on this thing like the song Magic City which is a very Bowie esque but kind of comatose ballad with very haunting and atmospheric synth chords very evocative lyrics - I get a similar vibe off of the track Kansas it's kind of interesting how under a lot of the forlorn vocals and smooth since and pillowy production there's kind of a very subtle glam rock influence ticking away I also like the closing cut quite a bit sook I if I'm pronouncing that correctly it's a really dejected ballad that hits listeners with these sort of disco inspired thrusts of strings at the very end it makes for a relatively dramatic ending relatively meaning in respect to the rest of the album because in the grander scheme of things that I really don't know if the song was that exciting you know there's just this really potent feeling of ennui that has a chokehold on the entire album which even infects some of the grooviest songs in the tracklist here like Hollywood featuring Snoop Dogg which features this really nocturnal of old-school techno and synth funk songs that are a bit more linear and groovier and were instrumentally intensive like Lake Zurich and sorcerers are still pretty decent admittedly the song humility has grown on me a little bit as a single since the release of the album because I kind of see the appeal to song a bit more in context with the whole aesthetic of the record and that is something I will give to the album though it's very emotionally and and sonically consistent which is maybe its biggest selling point because there was a moment in my initial listens where I was very much appreciating the style and the vibe of this album but once I dove into it deeper I was just kind of failing to find anything that backed the aesthetic of this album up anything that made it exciting beyond the surface level mood presented to the listener personally I don't really feel like there is but you know it's it's not a bad thing to have a mood album every once in a while this is very much a mood record like it's got a decent flow it's got a strong aesthetic some good musical highlights here and there but overall it's very low impact its kind of pleasant it's kind of sweet it's kind of sad not much else it's nice while it's on but I'm not sure if I would really go out of my way to listen to it again I'm feeling a light too decent 6 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the only to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana guerrillas forever 
67l6E8PVoFI,hi everyone Downton accountant appearing the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new j-rock album a Redemption this is the third full-length album from Top Dawg entertainment artist a black hippy member Jay Rock someone who I've kind of been crossing my fingers for for a while now hoping that he would eventually drop a super standout one-of-a-kind project one of the best on the label just as every other member of the label pretty much every major member of the label so far has done because j-rock is easily one of the more distinct and mature members of the black hippy affiliate and because of that I've been continually confused as to how projects like follow me home and 900 5/9 have come out so plain and lacking he could be dropping some of the most sage bars and hard-hitting projects of Top Dawg entertainment but instead he is kind of watering his sound down even more on Redemption this album is hardly what it is titled to be because I'm failing to see much about it that is redeeming granted the record does have a really strong start with the bloodiest a track that has grown on me since I originally heard it that in the song for what it's worth both very eerie dark trapped bangers with grim lyricism that occasionally goes a little philosophical autobiographical vocally j-rock is showing more conviction than I think he has on his past two projects the image of j-rock and the song Milly rocking in his lyrics is pretty hilarious to a very sharp bit of dark humor caught in between all of these bars a very deadly imagery also the production on these tracks is kind of next-level - I absolutely love the woodwind harmonies on the bloodiest the murky metallic melody is kind of swelling and fading away on for what but then redemption starts to fall off really quickly on the track knock it off where J Rock starts singing which in theory I respect especially since it doesn't seem like he touches his vocals up all that much he doesn't slather them and too much auto-tune doesn't try to distract from them being raw and that he doesn't have the best singing voice in the world of course I'm not expecting top-notch singing from j-rock however I do think his vocals fail to reach passability I guess as most of his singing on this thing just comes off too awkward too clunky too amateurish you bitch not enough the singing on this track is just literally annoying and goofy as it is on a lot of other cuts here like I'm tap out where he actually becomes a bit of an auto crooner and I think loses a lot of his personality on the song the song troopers is well and out of sight out of mind where J Cole is actually a legitimate highlight on the record and it's and it's a really j-rock that kind of is putting me to sleep occasionally the singing does work out like on rotation 112 where the auto-tune chorus vocals don't sound that bad they're super catchy and they contrast really well with rocks incredibly amped verses like he's just yelping and his upper register all over this track and it just makes for a really attention-grabbing sound even though there are these some low points on the album there are moments where j-rock does focus on his grimy and deliver some very dark straightforward rap bangers es tails is definitely one which has one of the meanest instrumentals on the entire record which rock pairs with lots of lyrical tales of drugs the prison system violence cops racism themes that are nothing new for Top Dawg entertainment fans but rocks Rottweiler voice just brings so much weight to these topics on moments like this it feels like j-rock is fully capitalizing on the natural talents that he has but then there are other moments here where it feels like that talent is being squandered like with wasting listeners time with the replacement of Kings dead on this record from the Black Panther soundtrack I mean it was probably always meant to be on this album but still having a spoiled so early on and in a different context previous to this album's release also on top of it having that horrendous future feature become a meme before the release of this album I think is only hurting this records potential - there's also the Wow freestyle with Kendrick Lamar which falls way below expectations not only because it's another Kendrick feature it's titled the Wow freestyle I want to go wow and on top of that the whole beginning of the song is hyped up with like hey let's get it like we used to back in the day I was like holy shit this is gonna go so fucking hard and yet it doesn't the beat is weak the flows are just okay even Kendricks voice sounds kind of silly like I would have assumed that given again that going back that do it like we - intro we'd be kind of throwing it back to a time when j-roc and Kendrick things are a little bit more simple things were a little bit more straightforward and lyrical maybe we'll be hearing something that has like the tone of a cypher but instead the WoW freestyle just sounds like a weakly structured throw away the song broke I appreciate rocks rapping for the majority of the track I appreciate the very sad and downtrodden theme of the song as well as the broke acronym kind of explaining what certain words mean within the context of the track but right at the beginning of the song Rock drops that really bad continuously debunked Harriet Tubman quote that fake Harriet Tubman quote the one saying she freed a thousand slaves that she would have freed a thousand more if they knew that they were slaves so on and so forth a quote that ironically has been continuously used by people to sort of put the onus of slavery on the slaves because oh if only they knew that they were slaves they would have tried to do something about it when in fact in this country when slavery was the law of the land they were numerous slave rebellions slaves were very well aware of their conditions and that they were not good and then we had the closer win which was a teaser track to this record which I just did not take - at all at first exposure I think I've only grown to dislike it more listening to it in the context of the album and trying to process it as a finishing track win win win win win win win win win win win win win win the bombastic beat combined with J Rock silly flow and ridiculous repetitions at the end of his lines it just kind of sounds like a parody song it sounds like somebody tried to make fun of this genre of music but it's it's actually deadly serious I'm not gonna say this album is a total mess but it's like mostly a mess I mean there are some highlights on here and a few passable tracks as well but much of what's here in my opinion is J ROCs worse material yet period and I can't help but feel like TD is sort of flopping a little bit on this because like where where's the quality control I mean I respect the artistic freedom but this does not sound like J Rock is trying to top previous projects or really anybody else on the TDE label I'm feeling a decent too strong for on this one transition have you given the sample Melissa did you love it did you hate what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a comment in the comments if you're feeling full of thoughts over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or they link to subscribe to the travel j-rok redemption forever 
ljtIQkFRL1g,my god hi everyone here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new drake album scorpion this is the latest full-length album from the six god from champagne papi drake canadian actor singer songwriter entertainer Aubrey Graham he's back and if you didn't already know he's at a kind of weird point in his career back when Drake was a mere little Wayne protege and was dropping super lovey-dovey pop rap songs for a mostly female audience while his material wasn't all that great the appeal of it at least made sense eventually Drake would go on to win over most of the rap listening audience with moody fusions of hip hop music and R&B on albums like take care and nothing was the same and his brand grew even larger from there with some of the most pivotal points in his music career so far 1 his if you're reading this it's too late mixtape which i think is kind of a high-water mark in his career also his kind of explosive collaborative project with future what a time to be alive and those super viral Meek Mill diss tracks in that beef even with Drake being exposed on the ghostwriter front he still came out ahead at this point it felt almost like Drake could do nothing wrong artistically and maybe Drake is aware of that because it seems like he spent most of his time since trying to test that very premise pretty much everything Drake has done since has seen him squandering his full potential to some degree whether it's the very bloated underwhelming and occasionally cringy views or the the more life release that he put out a little while back which is essentially filler the album but somehow it's okay because it's a playlist and then there's what's really the biggest L of his career so far and that was his whole Pusha T beef that went down recently where Drake essentially responded to Pusha with this dumpy freestyle after push sort of put some bars for him in little Wayne and Birdman in the final track of his latest record Daytona Pusha T has been throwing bars of these guys for years why Drake decided right now was the right time to respond I don't know maybe he was kind of feeling himself because of his elevated status and the music industry also kind of maybe having a bit of invincibility so to speak off of the whole Meek Mill when although let's be honest the brutality of that exchange came more from meek Millz horrid failed flat response blowing up in his face than it did from Drake's lyricism and Pusha T is obviously not going to be the pushover that Meek Mill was so while Drake had a pretty formidable response to Pusha pushes clat back after that completely cut Drake open and just threw his entrails all over social media talking about this Adidas press Ronnie had planned with his kid which nobody knew about at the time exposing him as as like a deadbeat dad or you know calling him out as not having much contact with his son calling into question his racial identity making fun of his parents and his upbringing also making fun of Noah for teased illness it was so mean without question pushes response here is one of the coldest and most destructive diss tracks ever it put Drake in a total checkmate and his only response to the whole thing was a little Instagram story post where he essentially explained the front cover image of the single and and that's it the whole beef just disappeared from there and it was an eerie silence which caused a lot of fans to wonder on this forthcoming album which had already been slated for release are we going to hear Drake address some or all of this in some way shape or form I mean he already dropped singles from this thing like nice for what and God's plan and I'm upset which were clearly recorded prior to all of this there's most likely a ton of other material on this thing that was recorded prior as well would Drake be laying down any tracks or bars in between the span of time that would do anything address anything get to the heart of anything also what direction is Drake going in artistically on this album it's two disks are they different is he changing up his usual style at all is he still gonna be trying to make watered-down dancehall music well the short answers to those are yes yes and no not anymore not really I don't think the sounds or musical styles respective to this one and two are really mutually exclusive but generally the second disc of this thing has a bit more moody alternative R&B vibe than the first and as far as changing up his style generally scorpion is one of Drake's most stripped back records yet the beats and flows on this thing are some of the simplest and Drake's entire catalogue and this can be a pro and Drake is trying to get across a really catchy or relatable idea but it can also be a con when the musical and lyrical ideas of a given song are so meager that Drake has really kind of given us very little to hang on and yeah Drake does give the dancehall ting kind of a break here so because the two discs of this thing are different I have slightly different opinions of both of them I think disc one is much more enjoyable and consistent though not by much a lot of the material on this disc is kind of averaged by Drake standards I would actually call it quintessential Drake right from the first track survival which features a very Spacey trap beat very faint haunting tones hanging in the background and of course Drake tops this with bars that simultaneously portray him is mega successful but also very sad especially with bars like my Mount Rushmore is me with four different expressions which is so hilariously egotistical it makes Kanye West seem well-adjusted not to mention this track is one of multiple times on this record where Drake seems to truly think that his success and fame is as a result of some kind of divine intervention I mean lots of artists out there thank God when they make it and that's cool that's totally fine but literally there are multiple points here where Drake seems to be under the impression that God has hand-picked him to make it in this music thing this intro track it's not a bad sound it's not a bad vibe but it's just kind of a vibe and there are also 24 more tracks on this thing and since this is the bar that the intro track is setting of course they're going to be moments that are much lower than this and they come rolling in with the song non-stop which is truly one of the more uneventful tracks in the tracklisting so little goes on in this song lyrically and instrumentally really the only defining factor of this track is that Drake is trying to sound really cold and really tough which after the way you just kind of slithered out of that beef with push a tee I don't understand why you would ever try to act tough ever again I mean the closing track on the first disc has Drake saying too many Walt Disney characters Mouse's and goofs I mean you know I love a challenge but challenged by who challenged by who not push a tee apparently no no thank you don't act like you're taking all comers when you're not especially with bars like I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect but that'll never happen I'm watching by step please just give me some catchy songs like maybe a few Marvin's rooms here and there and and let's just call it a day but Drake can't even do that on this record because of Drake's career at this very moment in time is defined by anything it's inconsistency when one of your major singles to this album is the song I'm upset something is wrong it's one of the most painfully boring Drake songs period it's a do-nothing instrumental that is total trash the flow is so basic it just pretty much sounds like Drake talking and the lyrics are loaded with so much personal my new show in the grander scheme of things it means absolutely nothing which is also partially an issue with a laundry list of other tracks on here to fall deeply in love with it you have to be so obsessed with Drake as a pop-culture icon that you'll basically eat up anything that comes out of his mouth because the portrayal is so flat and uninteresting and effortless there are some narrative bright spots in the tracklist like emotionless where the high-stakes decisions in Drake's life seem to have very heavy and important outcomes that he kind of filters through a very relatable lens I like a lot of the themes that come up in this track of the very poisonous entertainment industry then he's sort of out doing his idols and the greats in the genre that he came up in and that kind of creates an awkward situation where he feels sort of isolated then we have Drake reminiscing over his past and kind of losing touch of the genre that he exists in the new competition we get some fatherhood bars as well him dealing with misinformation in the media talking about how he's not gonna approach blogs that the story is wrong because a wise man once said nothing at all I mean there are some very smart cool and philosophical bars peppered throughout this tract that I like a lot but since when his Drake not been the artist to stand up and speak out since when is Drake not the artist who lays it all out there since when is Drake not the ultimate honest actor so up until this point that has either been a facade and Drake hasn't been an honest actor or he's decided that honesty isn't so important when he has something to hide either way the track has a great flow structure instrumental I love the Mariah Carey sample the song eight out of ten is well in my opinion is a pretty powerful cut definitely a big boss and very glamorous highlight Sandra's Rose is another highlight for me as well a track that is a tribute to his past his mother as well kind of sounds like one of those super inspirational personal and triumphant Drake songs that he typically ends a project off with but now we're kind of getting it in in the midst of all of the rest of the tracklist and as much as I do like it that the bars on this track are such a mixed bag this one bar about his uncle trying to help him out with stones and crystals and it would take more than that for him to control his issues also him saying that these guys want a classic and that's just 10 of these songs I like that a lot then him saying he's been stabbed in the back so many times he just walks backwards but then talking about how like Charlemagne the God he goes through like the the lightest and darkest patches sort of referring to the different colored pigmentation of his skin on his face that's such a stupid thing to say then on the song mob ties Drake pulls out this amazing young thug impression like it is dead on it is like scary accurate I mean the song is okay but it literally sounds like Drake is playing himself and then his own feature artists on the cut it kind of comes off like a halfway decent track from young thug's beautiful thugger girls I mean Drake has been called out before for stealing other artists sounds and flows and so on and so forth but this is like a new level and meanwhile talk up is a very grimy dark mean-mugging banger whose credibility comes mostly from jay-z landing on the track for whatever reason the song sounds slightly quieter than a lot of the others in the tracklisting a weird technical issue that I wouldn't have expected on a record with a budget this big but still that ex Zimmermann line on a Jay Z's verse was pretty badass not only that but you know just just generally hos VARs on the track are very nice it's a good lyrical pick-me-up after such a slog up until this point and and we're pretty much only done with the first disc here which overall like I would probably rate as like a decent two strong five maybe maybe a light six I'm like a good sunny day uh there's more I mean even though this thing kind of speeds by in a very quick 90 minutes it is not a fun 90 minutes especially in this second leg which is longer and more of an artistic wasteland which as I said earlier features more singing more spacey R&B tunes which in theory I don't necessarily mind I don't mind Drake as a singer I think his singing has in fact improved over the years but on most of the slower and more melodic cuts in this second disc Drake isn't really providing his fans with much of a song it's pretty much skeletal boring beats Drake moaning out into oblivion and some very washed out synthesizers on the song summer games Drake kind of goes synth pop it sounds like an awful postal service song things kind of pick up on the song nice for what which I mean I love but I kind of already knew that I loved it going into the record as a single it's one of those super catchy patronizing bangers where Drake basically kind of throws a lot of empty platitudes and hollow compliments at his listeners that are maybe a little bit more self-conscious that's a real one and your reflection without a follow without a mention it's kind of like Drake is telling me you to you the best you do you the best the beats switch up at the end is really great to kind of throws it back to like an 80s hip-hop remix of some sort it's a banger again it's a great track but it feels super out of place shoulder to shoulder with these super jaded all R&B crooners miraculously the song ratchet happy birthday is actually a highlight for me on this thing but only because it's so hilariously goofy which seems entirely intentional though I mean the track features these really awkward and silly synthesizer samples and piano arpeggios Drake is singing on top of this track with some really warbly auto-tune and lyrically it's like he's making a serious effort not to be so serious with lines like Reese's Pieces don't be ridiculous and it's your board I like that Drake is kind of letting go of this sadboy aesthetic on this track a little bit getting a little playful getting a little tongue-in-cheek but again why Drake wanted to put this cut on the sadder and more depressing of the two disks I I don't know there are so little in the way of like a logical flow across all the tracks on this side of the album then we have the song that's how you feel what is the mastering deal on this track the the synthesizers the bass it sounds so overpowering and kind of khalipa do we not care about how this album sounds are we literally just gonna throw anything out there with with not a care in the world we are basically Eminem now it's to the point where the sound quality of my project doesn't matter it's also to the point where Drake seems to be losing direction of himself in his own songs like this track featuring these very underwhelming Drake verses book ended by like these really weird Nicki Minaj live snippets it's just so random and unnecessary also these live Nicki Minaj vocal samples sound more interesting than even Drake himself does on his own song the appearance of future is well and the song blue tint just kind of seems like a distraction from the lack of a coherent song idea and this cut too then we have the song in my feelings where Drake is essentially dropping like a simple anthem keke do you love me are you writing this rap verse that he's recycled at least a few times recently like the amount of legitimately interesting song ideas in the first leg of this album were already very few and far between to begin with and now it's like he's starving people that have made it this far into the album even more the funny thing about this song is that even though my phone is nowhere near me I still feel like I'm just flipping through Instagram when listening to it I'm just on Twitter right now coming after this we have a track that was highly anticipated by a lot of people the song don't matter to me and the reason for this anticipation is because of Michael Jackson actually appears on the song or rather a vocal snippet from like an older recording session that didn't make the light of day up until now is is what made it onto the song Drake did Michael so wrong so wrong on this track did you need to expose Michael like that did you really need to like I know that Michael Jackson wasn't a god he was not a perfect being he was a man and a very flawed one at that but the dudes vocal chops were insane the dudes vocal track record was great and you were clearly throwing out there a moment in his career where vocally he was he was not really at peak performance and it seems like you don't really care it seems like all you really care about is that you got the feature you got the appearance you got the clout which is kind of one of the sad things about the music industry current-day because a lot of artists who have passed away like their older material their back catalog their lost tracks they're sort of undercover gems all that stuff it's it's all kind of available for grave robbery to the highest bidder on top of that Michaels voice is so heavily manipulated on this song like he sounds so washed out in disembodied like he is a ghost or a hologram or something the way he's placed into the track like his introduction into the track is really awkward - even though disc 2 has been mostly awful up until this point it does end much stronger than it started the song after dark features some pretty sensual grooves some very funny lead falsetto vocals on the hook that I like quite a bit ty dolla sign features on the song sings much better than Drake does on the track and pretty much steals the show the song Final Fantasy is easily one of Drake's most sexually explicit tracks yet it's kind of playful it's kind of odd but whatever potential it had is totally squandered by the weird and very awkward beats which up in the middle of it which features a nod Maury audio snippet like oh he looks like Drake the baby looks like Drake whoo also bars like slashing like Guns and Roses oh and Drake reminding us that he likes to have a glass of wine at sundown like a white woman from the suburbs the finishing track March 14th which clearly was not planned before this whole push Atty thing this is essentially an awkward attempt at connecting with his son through song I mean hopefully Drake fulfills the role of fatherhood on a personal level because this first attempt at trying to make his audience privy to this whole situation just felt very very uncomfortable especially since it still seems like he would have much rather had this situation slip into the background but goddamn what a slog this album was I'm really glad it's over I'm really glad I'm done with it but jeez I just pray for a day where Drake gets back to writing more focused albums with stronger clearer directions instead of just trying to pad this stuff out into oblivion but yeah those are basically my thoughts on that I like the second disc even less than the first I would probably give it like a light to decent three and I would average both of these discs out to pretty much like a light to decent four and then we go transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit

pressings of records that we have reviewed on the channel as well as you know audio equipment turntables that sort of thing we get kicked back from it supports the segment and let's do it the worst tracks the week the worst worst tracks of the week that's my little uh new improvised song introduction to the worst tracks of the week ok I hope you liked it I hope you liked it let me do it out in the comments what you would have rated it look at me and I'm looking a little less pale I look like I got like a touch just a dab of Sun not not so much so that I don't look like a ghost haunting the webcam at night but still all right first off this new Bad Religion track The Kids Are Alright you know I enjoy a nice political punk rock song every once in a while but the lyrics on this one are so corny and the freaking vocal melody is just so painfully basic I I feature this in an effort to make a plea that I hope the younger generation sort of tries to pick up the torch on this whole political music thing just a little bit more and just tries to make something that's a bit better but hey the the branding and the cover art and everything is is genius I'll say that much but the song unfortunately is a kind of underwhelming boring and very flaccid moving out from there ASAP ferg has a new couple of singles out sort of Lucy tracks that are easily a couple of his worst the the track verified here that I'm featuring more prominently is probably his most obnoxious song in a while I kind of get the the clout posting thing that he's kind of going for with the lyrics and everything but it's it's a really obnoxious track seemingly centered around just being verified on Twitter and so much more on top of it but still at the surface level there's not a whole lot to it and it's just a really annoying track again there's another singly drop along with it that is link down there below and also this new Alice glass track mine which is unfortunate because Ivan I've enjoyed much of what Alice has dropped as far as solo material thus far since leaving Crystal Castles but unfortunately this new track over here just kind of sounds like a very boring pastel goth piece of pop that almost like reaps not reaps but reeks of Grimes worship yeah there's not really much special about it in my opinion but let's get into the tracks that I thought were met not terrible not amazing certainly worth pointing out pointing pointing in your direction you might like them a little bit more than me let's go first off oh man what is what is this mysterious this mysteriousness over here oh this this must be the new Sun Kil moon yes mark kozilek does have a new project on the way and the first track he has seen fit to release from it is is a cover of The Partridge Family song come on get happy yeah it's it's it's a goofy little cover didn't blow me away or anything like that but it is interesting kind of here mark in a slightly different context what a happy-go-lucky guy what a happy-go-lucky guy next Paul McCartney yes sir Paul McCartney I believe is his proper title has two new singles out titled I don't know and come on to me the latter of the two has a very weird awkward and eyebrow raising hook I'll say that but both of them in and of themselves are not really bad piano rock tunes good hooks the vocal performances are pretty decent the instrumentation is nice and organic you know wasn't all that exciting or anything but you know still some fun tunes that might grow on me a little bit if I hear them in the context of a better album let's see moving on from there Morrison Adler has a new track out excuse me titled for my crimes not as lusciously arranged as a lot of the tracks on her last full-length album but still very pretty and haunting a very stripped bare and atmospheric piece of a very dark folk music make sure to check that out also villi and lil yachty got together on this new track over here titled wombo it's kind of goofy sort of a left-field piece of pop trap it's not bad it's not bad at all moving on from there we have knife fights and this song over here is titled give you game it's out on Sub Pop Records and this song features of course Palace ear Lazzaro or Ishmael Butler of freakin Shabazz Palaces Fame and he's teaming up with one mr. Eric Blood I believe and together they're essentially embarking on this this new musical duo project this first song over here sort of sounds like a slightly more spacey psychedelic and and strange and soulful take on the Shabazz Palaces sound it's not a bad move it's it's not a bad direction to go in you know does it sound entirely like what Ishmael was doing before but you know not not totally alien either it's not a complete departure you know if you like the kind of digital trippy otherworldly experimental rap sound the Shabazz Palaces is kind of a bill their name on I think you'll at least sort of see where this track is coming from and get quite a bit from it even if I think structurally and hook wise it is a little lacking moving on from there the new Dirty Projectors track over here that's a life style is not too bad didn't blow me away like some of the popular tracks off of their greatest records or even some of the more adventurous songs on their most experimental output way back in the day but it does seem like a bit of a return to form to the very angular soulful and in vertuous guitar pop that Dirty Projectors are known for not quite the alternative R&B direction that David had the project's last record going in it still kind of is a little disheartening to kind of hear Dirty Projectors stripped-back personnel-wise and you know not hear the voices that personally made the project so great to begin with and it's just really kind of David being the main brain right now and that's pretty much it but still it's not a bad cut it's not a bad cut the guitar work is great moving on from there I'm also digging a little bit just just to touch on this new Armand Hammer track over here of course Billy woods and Lucid are back as a duo with a nice piece of grimy underground hip hop goodness with super esoteric cryptic bars and a super dark rough beat and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best the tracks that really kind of won me over this week first Tony Malina kill the lights very sweet and to the point acoustic cut with kind of like a 60s pop vibe to it a little bit that I liked quite a bit of course given that as Tony Mele in the song is like a minute long and there's no telling how great it's going to be or where it's going to fit in terms of like power structure and appeal in his forthcoming project until you hear it back to back with all the other incredibly short songs so while this track was really pretty I'm still kind of holding out full judgment until I hear this entire album moving out from there ooh this new uh freaking what is this again Rome fortune track hood wear hood rich disco with production from Toro y Moi is a really great experimental futuristic piece of like what sounded like I don't know a blend of hip hop funk and house music really love what Chas was able to do on the beat with this thing and the lead vocals are are great as well lots of personality on this track and I don't know hopefully these two work together more in the future because this was a great freaking single super fun and one of the more eclectic tracks I've heard in a while in this particular genre this blend of hip hop in and in dance music moving on from there DJ Muggs of Cypress Hill Fame of course and MF DOOM land on a new teaser track which I guess is gonna be slated to be on on a record or at least like a series of projects that mugs is working on that I guess we're gonna tell like a story for like certain spans of time with certain certain rappers that he's working closely with like I read a lot of details on it but none of them seem to sort of I guess tell from front to back the entirety of the concept of this forthcoming record but if he's pullin names like doom and he's bringing tracks that are this quality then certainly it's worth being excited for the track that I'm talking about over here is titled death wish I believe just double-checking on that yes death wish and it features Freddie Gibbs and Freddy's bars are pretty cool so are dooms the B is very dark murky and low-key but only hi sight only rather highlights quality lyricism that Freddie and doom bring to the table next moving on from there digging on this new myths key track which is great because I've never really been super huge on her music previously but this this ballad was just too a moose we heavy impotent to not kind of win me over and also like her vocals are starting to warm up to me a little bit as well not that they thought they were terrible before but I don't just has this wonderful womanly voice that's a really kind of appealing to me right now at this moment next lizzo new single out titled boys which from what I've heard a little Aaron had like a hand in writing or sort of creating or whatever if you're a fan of him that's a banger banger alert banger alert over here guys but banger it's a very fun sensual lusty track with a real sex drive and a quirky instrumental nice a nice kind of house vibe in the beat to kind of reminded me of like a smarter cooler and improved and more thoughtful version of like I don't know like Azealia Banks 2 & 2 or something like that crossed with something else as well almost had like a bit of an LCD Soundsystem vibe I'd say as well and like some of the the vocals and the instrumental - that's fucking awesome moving on from there igloo ghost has like two small short sister projects coming out very soon he has seen fit to release song from one of them titled night racer and given that it is igloo ghost you know the production is absolutely insane it's like watching anime on on way too much acid it's amazing moving on from there idk has a new single out I guess from what he says he's a taken the double XL freshman 10th spot he's taken it I don't know how legitimate that is but he's come out with a track titled uh it's it's it sound like the trippy red freestyle or whatever so again it but it doesn't seem like the be an overt disor anything like that it seems like it's kind of clowning the whole situation but still I kind of love that this is kind of you know in my opinion this is a true artists response to this whole shit you know what I mean because idk easily deserved one of the main spots on this whole double XL thing and he really kind of came through with a great beat great energy awesome bar and pretty much exemplifies why he's going to have a pretty long shelf life going forward you know I think IBK has a serious future it's all going to depend on whether or not his next project really kind of like sees him separating himself from his very clear and very contemporary influences but with tracks like this he's clearly displaying that he's on the way to doing that so I'm pretty excited for for what this dude has coming down the pipe maybe more than that of some of the people who actually made it on to you know the the main nine double XL list moving on from there ooh cupcake is back with a song title two hot pockets it's a banger banger alert it's fucking awesome and I'm really happy to hear a cupcake finally you know between this and her past couple of singles landing on production that actually like fits and enhances her very quirky weird out there and and unique personality that is awesome that is amazing and it's it's only making her music even tastier and I think this might be the last one though we got a couple more but this is code orange over here they have a new EP out they have seen fit to release a few tracks three knives and the hunt featuring Cory Taylor of Slipknot Fame are two incredibly heavy punishing amazing songs that see the band getting even more ambitious when it comes to detail and experimental weird out their sounds in their production I'm actually like so fucking excited for this band's future because they just seemed to be continually just breaking down boundaries in the metal genre and are just like trying a lot of things and taking a lot of risks artistic risks that a lot of other bands out there aren't and and in the process still making very catchy engaging interesting music not not like too out there or I guess alien or experimental for your average you know metal metal fans who appreciate and the Cory Taylor feature is is great and I want to shout out Charli XCX she dropped two new tracks one focus one no angel focus was a little repetitive and underwhelming to me kind of didn't really have as much structure as I would have liked it just seemed like very flat and OneNote however the the what I guess is the b-side to that song no angel is the is the true hit here in my opinion I had a fantastic instrumental great energy more interesting vocal line given that as Charli XCX you're talking about very cutting-edge futuristic and weirdo pop music something that sounds almost like a playful bastardization of what you typically hear in the top 40 although I will say these two tracks over here not two of her weirdest but uh but still very enjoyable and you know Charlie just continues to kill it for the most part and oh I want to shout out also ariana grande I know this track came out a little while ago but I wanted to sort of trip back and talk about it because I do think it is so good this new collaborative single actually has that's gonna be on her forthcoming record features Nicki Minaj it's titled the light is coming and it actually features production from Pharrell Nicki's attitude right at the front Ariana's very deep womanly voice powerful singing voice and for Elle's production just come together into a fucking firework man it's just a great single obviously given that Pharrell and Nicki are not gonna be on every track and Ariana herself can be a little inconsistent as far as like songwriting quality on her tracks who the hell knows what the rest of the record is gonna be this good but I can at least say like this song is fantastic if you hear no other song on this forthcoming record at least make it this one this one was very fun very creative and you know for a pop artist of Ariana's stature and I get given that it's Pharrell you know he kind of gets a pass anywhere that he goes but still for an artist of ariana grande's you know the cloth that she has cut from this is a pretty weird cut you know it's a pretty odd freaky cut and I like that like it like it quite a bit alright I think I'm uh just about done sweating my ass off in front of you guys excuse-excuse the undershirt over here but it's hot it's hot out okay it's hot it's hot in here it's hot

E7uoajRW7sM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well laying down a quickie review here of the new project Freddy from Gary Indiana rapper Freddie Gibbs who you may know from his many solo projects over the years his break out record his soon to be classic as the years draw and I'm sure a collaborative album with Madeline pinata now Freddie since the release of that album I've been keeping close tabs on a lot of the music he's releasing because of course when you're so close to a real high point artistically in your career you gotta look out you know because hey who knows when the next fantastic record is gonna be dropping and even though Freddie's follow-ups to that project even though they have been quite as excellent still I do find excellence in albums like shadow of a doubt for example his return album I thought had a lot of flashes of greatness on there too though it was a kind of short and relatively underwhelming project and now Freddie to me this seems like we're still kind of just trending trending downwards unfortunately like I wouldn't call this record a total blowout of disappointment or anything like that but it is a little on the short side despite having 10 tracks in its track listing just about two minutes and change for each song here aesthetically it doesn't really seem like that much of a change from shadow of a doubt because we're kind of getting a very similar flow style to which we received on that album also on top of that a lot of very skeletal yet Spacey moody and kind of murky trap beats - so it's like Freddie sound hasn't even really progressed that much since the release of that album lyrically we still kind of get a lot of the same references to just gang culture violence of course graphic sex again none of this stuff is bad to have in song but there's not a whole lot in the way of focus on a lot of these tracks you know just topics the the subject matter is the the content just seems super super general for Freddie nothing really kind of lines up in any significant way in my opinion there are some tracks that in my opinion hit harder than others triple threat is pretty great death row featuring o3 Greedo is actually a freaking banger grito delivers I think one of his best features that I've ever heard there's a nice jumping a little synth lead that kind of reminds me of NWA a little bit in the instrumental that I thought was pretty great you know I guess I was just kind of expecting a bit more of an aesthetic change or something just a bit more adventurous I guess I mean it sort of seemed like this might be Freddy kind of turning a somewhat maybe a motional leaf or something on this record not to not to say I thought he was gonna go totally introspective or go Drake on us or anything like that but I thought that maybe he'd kind of changed things up get a little tongue-in-cheek or just provides something that really I don't know maybe start sampling some more Teddy Pendergrass since like he obviously referenced him so blatantly in the the cover over here maybe like kind of pull more from that era of music to kind of inspire the content or the sound of this new project but again unfortunately like sonically and strim enta Lee lyrically again and rhythmically when it comes to flow there's not a whole lot of progression between this and and what Freddy has been releasing or was releasing and just several years ago yeah I'm just kind of underwhelmed by this and it just kind of seems like Freddy is continuing to just spin his wheels in the mud a little bit for sure he's definitely still very much an above-average rapper and emcee for sure he can rap a lot of these SoundCloud kids with multicolored hair under the table without even getting up out of a sound sleep but I feel like the potential the the baseline level of talent that he comes into every project with he's not really building on top of it all that significantly he just kind of content at this point to continue giving fans just more of the same without altering growing improving maturing but Freddie has a few pretty decent tracks on it for the most part it is pleasant to listen to while it's on but overall I'm pretty indifferent to this thing and don't have a whole lot of strong feelings on it there wasn't a lot about this record that really kind of begged me to dive deeply into it and then pull every nook and cranny of it apart because on the surface all of it just seemed so unambitious and kind of plain for Freddie Gibbs honestly so yeah I'm just kind of feeling pretty mint on this to be frank over here next to my head is a another video you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Freddie Gibbs Freddie forever 
ynCFF7DWHmI,hi everyone slapped in the hands tan oh dear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the brand-new Death Grips album year of the snitch Death Grips are a Sacramento based experimental hip hop trio consisting of drummer Zach Hill producer flatlander also frontman lyricist extraordinaire a ride as a trio they exploded onto the internet based music scene much earlier this decade through releases like their ex-military mixtape and the Money Store ever since their musical breakthrough their sound has remained one of the most polarizing things in modern music today and for good reason the group's clash of hip hop industrial music noise glitch pop and electronic music is is not the fusion for everyone and I think death grips sound has only managed to get more and more difficult as the years have drawn on like on the animalistic and unruly no love deep web or the incredibly abstract government plates or the one-two punch of the double album the powers that be the first half of which features all these really super prominent Bjork vocal samples littered all over the record and then following that up with Jenny Beth which is a roaring guitar riff heavy record bottomless pit' pretty much played as a somewhat catchy update on a lot of the sounds the band had forged up until that point nothing all that exciting and nuba still and incredibly well produced and catchy album but immediately after this release Death Grips went left-field once again with their steroids megamix incorporating elements of cyberpunk and Gabbar music in there already eclectic and chaotic repertoire not to mention that this mega mix or EP is just this continuous 22 minute long musical experience now as far as my expectations for year of the snitch went I kind of hoped that Death Grips would continue down this experimental Road continue to try new things especially since it seemed like they were kind of painting themselves into an artistic corner with bottomless pit' as good as it was because to me that album and Jenny death kind of feels like the closing of a chapter in the band's career and I was sort of hoping that steroids was a bit of a pre loo to what they might be doing going forward however I was kind of lukewarm on some of the teaser tracks to this album going into it so I didn't really know what to expect out of this album which is partially whirring but simultaneously exciting I like the fact that I've been listening to Death Grips for almost a decade now and I can pretty much expect for them to surprise me with every new release it's great that a band almost 10 years on is still pretty much pushing the envelope and they pretty much do that on you're the snitch while departing pretty boldly away from the industrial hiphop sound that they're known for now it's not completely gone I mean I think the the core elements of the band sounds still very much remain on this album but death grips are incorporating way more elements of psychedelic rock and krautrock electronic music experimental and progressive rock you keep even a little bit of jazz too on top of that it feels like death grips are starting to incorporate some of the out-there compositional ideas that you might find if you went back and listened to some of sack Hill's solo stuff on albums like astrological straits which felt like they were having more presence in the band's sound on that steroids megamix - also those aisle wise records that Zach Hill and flatlander have been releasing on the side so again while you're the snitch does feel like a stylistic and a genre change for the band you're still getting Zach Hills insane drumming Flatlanders abrasive futuristic and in very dark production rides intense and absolutely insane vocal performances and his cryptic lyricism but now all of these elements are being fed into very different musical styles in with incredibly kooky instrumentation weird synthesizers and effects and delays and samples turntable scratching quite a bit of that there are also multiple instances on this album in which death grips are sampling their older material - generally I would say the songs aren't quite as dark and edgy as a lot of Death Grips past material like on records such as no love deep web instead in the 37 minutes that this record lasts you're the snitch comes off way more absurdist and abstract and completely weird also there are lots of seemingly random transitional moments from one track to the next or short interstitial tracks that actually add quite a bit of flow and personality to the record honestly the whole thing is a really wild ride right from the start kicking things off with Death Grips is online which is what a 90s rave must have sounded like if you were on enough to to kill a horse with all these entrancing delayed synth leads very persistent bustling driving be in these enveloping washy synth chords that kind of feel like when they pop in I'm whizzing down a concrete tunnel at a thousand miles an hour also rides shrieks throughout the track the booming bass the turntable scratches all add a lot of very quirky and freaky flavor to the mix the track is trippy it's overwhelming it's infinitely groovy the track flies has grown on me quite a bit since the release of the album originally I found it kind of underwhelming but in the context of the record it feels like a perfect counterpoint to DG is online also the kind of sour and warped Cynthia PG O's make much more sense in the context of the electronic dance music influences that much of this album is immersed in also the super disturbing lyrics on this cut about flies vomiting obviously to digest their food the lyrics on the hook I think are a little open to refrain but the way that I'm reading them it's like flies are vomiting up ride as if he is the disgusting enzymes that come out of them is he filth is this song filth is he death I I don't know either way on this track I feel like the band is really kind of embodying the dark underbelly of the Internet and also kind of enhancing the narrative of tracks like trash from bottomless pit for example as well as show later on the album there is a very eerie and droning transition out of flies that brings us into black paint which is quickly becoming one of my favorite death grip songs period it's a jammy twisted piece of experimental arena rock at points it kind of reminds me of some of the more guitar centric tracks on jenni death but even better this time around I loved the lyrics about darkness being shrouded in it it almost feels like an update on the Rolling Stones painted black but for the Millenial industrial hip-hop generation the song features these amazing dense heavy tension building verses that eventually explode into these like riotous riffs that feature on top of them ride chanting a it sounds like something out of an ac/dc song there's an awesome instrumental bridge on the cut a kind of jammy trippy freaky synth solo at the very end the song Linda's in custody is very quiet and settling cool down point with these quirky synth leads on the hook a super-busy and synthetic beat that kind of reminds me of past Death Grips releases like no love deep web or government plates and ride wrapping in a very quiet fashion with his vocals kind of overpowering the beat anyway right up in your face super claustrophobic people around the internet have been talking about the Lynda being mentioned in this song in fact being Linda Kasabian further cementing the series of nods throughout the Death Grips discography to Charles Manson and the Manson Family and while this cut is not one of the harder or more aggressive in the track listing here it does still have lots of detail to offer plenty of strange effects whizzing by and really impressive musicianship and production techniques all around we get kind of a fun transitional moment with horns section which features these keyboard passages and and drums that just do not let up they're so mind-blowing Lee intense for the minute and change at this track lasts we get a breather post that with the song hahaha another supremely weird teaser track that now makes a lot more sense in the context of the album and despite the psychedelic and kind of silly additions to Death Grips sound on this cut believe it or not this is actually one of the more familiar sounding moments on the record meaning this feels more in Death Grips industrial hip-hop wheelhouse that in the song streaky - whose absurd keyboards and vocal effects stand out so much more in the context of snitch also I think I can unequivocally say that these two tracks are maybe two of Death Grips most fun songs meanwhile the utterly chaotic show kind of serves as a like a modus operandi for the record it's kind of like the band trying to sound as noisy and abrasive and chaotic as possible in a very short span of time and definitely succeeding in the process again to me this cut is very much like the trash of the album oh we make trash trash begets trash we upload trash we're overwhelming the Internet we're overloading the internet over here it's a show we're just literally making a show watch it gawk it freak out at it the song dilemma is a super jammy linear and kraut rocky and peace a song that generally sees Death Grips sounding more like a live and a full band as opposed to a group of people just kind of assembling a piece of music and in a very sanitary fashion in a digital audio workstation between the grooves rides performance also the interesting synth leads on here the riffs it's all very thrilling and futuristic sounding the fear also sounds very much like just a live band performing but now instead of a kind of linear krautrock thing it almost feels like a fusion of jazz rock and progressive rock with these super sinister keyboards never thought I would ever hear Death Grips put together something that sounds like this yet here we are and it's fantastic I love the lyrics on this track to the seemed to call out to again literally fear mental instability phobias also rides freakish shouts on the chorus are amazing this is the first time in a while like maybe since no love deep web where I felt like the band's music sounded genuinely frightening the outro cut is kind of short and abrasive and low fie and strange and then that kind of guides us into disappointed a predictive track the band was releasing maybe in anticipation that fans wouldn't really take to this new sound of theirs so kind of beat them to not liking the record call fans out on not being able to handle it and while yes I understand that there has been some criticism and some kickback against this record I myself was not super crazy about the singles going into it but generally the the response amongst fans for this album from what I've seen is pretty positive I do love the track I think the instrumental is fantastic I love rides shrieks of why me I love how sarcastic and mocking the song is generally I would never deprive Death Grips of the opportunity to break their fans balls or basically get at their critics they've done it numerous times before but maybe in this instance they've sort of put the cart before the horse just just a little bit because you're of the snitch is a pretty fantastic record Death Grips fans have been riding with them for pretty long up until this point and have sat through some pretty incredible and strange releases to get to year of the snitch fans generally enjoy steroids fans generally enjoy government plates and fans generally enjoy the first half of the powers-that-be and I definitely see year of the snitch as being in league with those albums on the weirder side of the spectrum in the Death Grips discography in fact I think it may be my favorite of the weirder albums that they released so far with of course releases like bottomless pit and the Money Store and ex-military being so much more accessible by comparison but overall again I think this is a great listen I think it's a great new sound for Death Grips I think it's super exciting and again I'll use the word overwhelming mind-bending utterly strange completely dynamic super versatile lots of Sonic layers to this album - I wouldn't say it's as high fidelity as bottomless pit but there's still a lot of sonic details on this album that I uncover with every listen whether it be weird rhythmic nuances and Zach Hills drumming or another strange super esoteric sample placed hidden somewhere in the track the performances across this record generally are pretty exhilarating I love the absurd attitude and nature of this record - in a way this album comes off as Death Grips not really taking themselves all too seriously and that's not to say that they didn't put effort into the album or something like that it just feels like they're letting go a little bit of the super dark edgy and tortured aesthetics that got them to where they are today and are instead embracing a sound that is much more fringe and out of control I'm feeling a light - decent 9:00 on this album tatata tatata transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the links subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana death grips forever 
t7-aROT2eqo,what is going on here inch flannel this shirt it's it's a it's a it's a color I have no idea my reality is falling apart my world is crumbling hey everyone destiny teeth tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new RICO nasty project nasty this is the latest full-length project from DC based rapper Rico nasty over the past year Rico nasty has become one of the most exciting faces and hardcore hip-hop trap and pop rap and her musical transition has been pretty miraculous just a little while ago she was dropping projects like tales of taco bella and sugar trap 2 both of which kind of had her sounding like a generic auto crooner / super glitzy instrumentals kind of like a cross between a little woozy varenna and a little yadi the latter of those two she actually collaborated with even though I don't think Rico at the time had a very strong sound a very distinct voice she certainly did have a big commodity on these records and that was her very nasty sarcastic and in bitter personality now her sound and delivery has only grown nastier as she has continued it's it's kind of reached an apex point on this new project over here nowadays Rico is rapping far more than she's singing on a project and she delivers her verses on this thing and this super raspy animated voice that just kind of snaps me into attention every time these singles leading up to this thing I absolutely love tracks like trust issues and rage both of which feature killer production from kenny beats with lots of distorted tones throughout some of which sound like guitar riffs it's kind of like i'm listening to a fusion between nu metal and trapper app and it's pretty amazing it's like a match made in heaven so going into this thing i was pretty excited to hear some bangers just hearing rico dish out these equally badass and abrasive takes on trap music and she does that on multiple tracks here not just the teasers not just the singles trust issues and rage but some deep cuts to tracks like ice cream which features an amazing like ice cream truck song sample essentially a track all about attracting guys in the same way that i guess an i scream truck would attract kids it's a pretty funny comparison and speaks a lot to Rico's personality the song countin up which is easily the most killer track in the first leg of the record kind of feels like a throwback beat something Pharrell would have produced in the 2000s but like with a punk twist Rico's flow on the track is fantastic her nastiness is unparalleled the song transformer is maybe the most bombastic track on the entire record a truly evil song featuring a really extreme feature from little gnar definitely a more fitting pairing for nasty than black boy JB earlier on the record whose feature sounds I don't know kind of average and formulaic for him as much as he does try to play into the hole in the air hook refrain theme of the track on the best moments of this project Rico nasty pretty much just delivers explosive performances super brash bars the lyricism isn't super top-notch but it's partially made up for with their crude unforgiving in vicious persona Rico is an artist that does seem to put a lot of effort into just kind of peppering little personal details throughout a lot of these songs throughout the record though so as I listened through nasty I got a bit more of a sense of the personality beyond the mean mug that she puts on still I wouldn't really say that's enough to kind of make the album feel all that deep or personal nor is the album all that varied either I mean she couldn't literally pack this entire thing with one banger after another so of course she has to bring some kind of variation and when Rico does that she kind of exposes just how little tools she has in her tool belt to kind of build out a tracklist with a lot of great and diverse songs because Rico's continuously abrasive delivery as invigorating and exciting as it is on first listen it does kind of grow tiresome after a while especially as she does nothing to reel her voice back of it when she's hopping on these mellow and melodic instrumentals like an Oreo and hockey the first truly clean vocal we get on the album is on the track won't change and believe me it's a welcome change this track kind of feels like Rico is referencing back to her glitzier and more auto-tune based style from a while ago but now with better production and hooks and songwriting overall she's just a sharper artist than she was a few years ago though I will say not every one of the tracts on this thing are fantastic I mean there is the track yoy which is maybe one of the more obnoxious on the record with the brevity and similarity of these songs all stacked on top of one another there are a lot of tracks that just kind of pale in comparison to others it's pretty clear that Rico and Kenny are just trying to pen as many bangers as possible to kind of see what'll stick which is not a bad way of going about things if you're just kind of generally looking for attention but it does kind of make for a very one-dimensional record especially when you have tracks on here like la la as the closer which just kind of feels like very slow uninspired syrupy filler without a doubt Rico can get in your face and spit some really tough brags over a kind of left-field instrumental and it's exciting it's colorful it's entertaining it's fun but for the sake of longevity there needs to be more brought to the table than this especially since a lot of your competition is trying to do exactly the same thing many of whom you're already surpassing because you bring so much more presence to a song than they do so why not go the extra mile and do a track with a bit more structure a bit more substance to it since you're a unique voice and style are already doing so much for you I thought nasty was mostly enjoyable it's a decent break out but the question is kind of where does it go from here I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best true

XyB3yOo81cU,Hey hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Sofie album oil of every pearls on insides this is the debut full-length commercial album from producer DJ singer Sophie someone I've kind of been a fan of ever since I first heard her experimental and bubbly production on mind-bending singles like lemonade and BIP and hard a lot of these cuts eventually landing on a great 2015 compilation project titled product and the three years since the release of product had been a time of transition and maturation for Sophie in the personal sense with Sophie essentially coming out as transgender and artistically with her Landing production jobs with the likes of Madonna and Ben staples and finding ways to work art pop into the chaotic and glitchy bubblegum bass sounds that she built her name on this is no doubt an album I've been looking forward to because pretty much every teaser tracked to it has been flames not only that but the final product is essentially nine tracks and 39 minutes and this thing is every bit as mind-expanding and and soul igniting as I hoped it would be who is making music like this who absolutely Sofie is far from the first artist to combine elements of aggressive dance music and and Glitch pop and art pop however she also manages to work in elements of ambient music and industrial along the way - and I feel like Sofia is one of those artists where the devil truly is in the details I mean in the strange rhythmic switch ups that typically make it into a Sophie song the synth Tambor's the weird vocal manipulations all of these things are truly unique to this particular artist now before I go too deep into this review I will get my one major complaint about this album out of the way the flow of this record from track to track it's a bit odd not in the best way it just doesn't feel like there's a whole lot of logical and stylistic cohesion to many of these tracks especially as we barrel toward the midway point as we're going - is it cold in the water - infatuation - not okay - pretending all of these songs are respectively creative and unique pieces of work in the tracklisting here but they all come together somewhat awkwardly infatuation has a stunningly beautiful vibe presenting these strange sound effects glassy keyboards and alien lead vocals that slowly blossom into an empowering and soulful wall of luscious harmonies the track does kind of feel like as a linear progression but not much of an ascension along it the glitchy lead synth melodies that kind of grow more and more aimless as the song plods along don't really add that much to the track the ending in my opinion is kind of fizzled as pretty as the sound of this song is it just kind of feels like I'm listening to an overly long transitional moment without that payoff at some point without that payoff at the end the song not okay not a terrible song in and of itself but to kind of follow this moment with a dystopian post-industrial banger that cashes out in under two minutes is kind of a head-scratcher while it is an unorthodox switch up I wouldn't say it's interesting as a result of it not to mention that this track leans up against the massive ambient drone cut pretending which yeah it's one of my favorite tracks on here I love it the sound design on this cut is so massive heavy vivid and fantastic it sounds like it could come out of like I don't know some amazing summer blockbuster movie soundtrack but how the album ends up here through the progression of songs that came before it seems almost random or by chance then we move on to in material which is like one of the brightest and most fantastic pop anthems on the entire record it feels like a sharp but abstract and very delayed response to Madonna's Material Girl the intro of the track is packed with this really reverb II and angelic synth lead and invoke elite it feels like I'm being pulled up to heaven and then when I get the full frequency range everything's up front in my face and I get that baseline it's like I've arrived also the lyrics on this track really weird really out there but I love them essentially about existentialism or again in materialism or physicality the singing on this track is delivered by this really cartoony whacked-out kind of squeaky pitched female voice just kind of feels like something out of a really twisted cartoon but even more twists then this track is the closer whole new world and pretend world where a lot of those dark and heavy industrial elements that were featured so much more prominently on the first leg of the record return to play for the duration of the entire cut it's 9 minutes long it features one twisted musical passage after another actually I would insist the song gets more twisted and abstract and and abrasive and out there as it plods along with each synth change and and rhythm shift getting more and more grotesque until basically all the sonic gaps in between the instrumentation gets filled out with this really unsettling but bright drone that kind of swallows the song hole at the very finish it's like I'm listening to the musical equivalent of being born and even though yeah the song gets stranger as it continues like it starts off pretty freaky with these weird snorting vocals that I just cannot decipher how exactly Sofie manipulated them to get them to the point where they are now yeah I just could not tell how this is functioning then there are these laser beams synth leads and and these garish lead vocals that are just so whacked I can't take my eyes away from them and they're just saying this this new world it's an alien one and I love it now the first leg of the record is pretty much like the lead singles that T's toward the album in the first place tracks like it's okay to cry which is a really lucious earnest and wonderful song definitely one of my favorite pieces of art pop this decade glistening gorgeous synth leads a really calming vocal great atmosphere and buildups I just loved lyrical sentiment of the song too the song is so sensual in the amount of passion Sophie packs into the track it's okay to crash it just hits me in the fields then there's pony boy which makes me feel feelings I never thought I had this is like the kinkiest thing ever the crushing oppressive be the the girlish penny by refrains the devilish lead vocals delivering these incredibly sinister and violently sexual lyrics it's like some supremely BDSM and it is now my goal to make sure that before I die I am spanked until I cry to this song yeah face shopping has quite a few aesthetic similarities to Ponyboy which maybe I didn't really appreciate until I kind of heard them back-to-back this track also features since that are kind of screeching rumbling bass earth-shattering percussion but this is truly Sophie's sound and and it's such a unique and in one-of-a-kind sound that I don't really mind hearing a lot of these same textures being played once again at a kind of different angle with a different tune especially with that chilling vocal break at that two minute and 15 seconds on this track it's like we're suddenly transitioned from complete torture and confusion and chaos into like Oh everything's perfect everything's fine it's utopia also I just love what the lyrics on this song say about just physicality looks maybe one could say that some of the inspiration the sophie is going into these lyrics with might come in fact from her recently coming out as transgender and dealing with issues of dysmorphia or just the disconnect that one might feel when feeling uncomfortable in or just having difficulty existing in their own body the song is a cold in the water is another pretty beautiful ballad and the track listing here it's like a wonderful far-off alien song laying on a bed of intergalactic arpeggios otherworldly lead vocals calling out into the vast reaches of space it's not one of the more structurally solid moments on the record but the sounds on this thing are so vivid and varying that the track does not get redundant at all and those are essentially my thoughts on the record for sure there are sounds and themes that tie and much of it together I wouldn't call the entire record a totally disjointed experience but still there are a few rifts in the flow of the album that kind of break what I feel it could have been a more cohesive listen apart all that being said though this is a very inventive smart sexy thrilling and probably DNA altering album again it could have been cohesive but this thing was still a fantastic listen which I'm not gonna forget anytime soon I am feeling a decent too strong eight on this thing transition

_LEQYT-ffsM,okay hi everyone Denis tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new NAS album nasir new album from New York hip hop heavyweight nasty nas Nostradamus nas joining in on Kanye West's short album streak this summer this is the fourth project he's had his hands on he had push a tease Daytona his own project yay also his collaborative record with Kid Cudi and and now this NAS album like every other release in the series thus far we're talking seven tracks rounding out at about twenty minutes similar in aesthetic to the other releases in the series the songs on this thing are pretty raw pretty direct with a somewhat artsy Flair which is typically brought through Kanye West's production for an artist of nas's pedigree this of course is all good news since we're pretty much guaranteed with such a short tracklist to have no frills on this album at all we are not going to be subjected to a song like summer on smash from nas's last album life is good thankfully the album kind of kicks off with a bang on the song not for radio featuring Puff Daddy the track is marked with this epic grand monstrous instrumental with the cinematic background vocals and string samples very fitting for lyrical references to diamonds and Egyptian gods and nas's verses in the second leg at the track nas's lyrics transition away from all the references to God and power and extravagance and he starts dropping all these really provocative hyper political proclamations they do come off a bit disconnected and stiff nas's flow is somewhat low impact on this track however I do appreciate all the strong statements he's trying to make in such a short amount of time on this track about politics and racism and discrimination again it's a really good and powerful start to the record and the refrain of I think they scared of us makes for a really incredible hook - I pretty much have nothing but good things to say about the track cop shot the kid following immediately after insane beat with all these relentless rhythms a very odd groove and these super persistent Slick Rick vocal samples which were pulled from one of my favorite songs of his children's story also this really tripped out and delayed tire screeching effect that pops up in the song every once in a while nas's comments about police brutality all over the song are super direct and vivid and grim Kanye echos them really well on his feature on the track - I mean I love these two songs so far up until this point it seemed like man this is gonna be another one in the can another nail in the coffin in this Kanye West summer series because given how solid and consistent it is in these two songs like how could it not continue to deliver and yet NAS falls short unfortunately like many of the projects Kanye has had his hands on so far this summer this thing is not flames from start-to-finish after cops shot the kid I wouldn't say the album takes a nosedive but it kind of goes from hot to lukewarm and then just continues at that pace the repetitious and underwhelming white label sees nas pulling on like a lot of veteran flexing and extravagance but not really to any significant end the song is also peppered with incredibly weak similes one of which being you believe in your own lies can't be real and the odds is that what you love could kill you like a heart physician who dies from a heart attack I'd say things get even weaker on the track Bonjour I mean it's not a bad instrumental Tony Williams does really well on the hook too but the opening verse on this cut about women pre-baiting in order to kind of like dampen down their sexual urges but getting slayed anyway is like the most grossly self-serving verse I've heard nas drop in like a decade things kind of pick up on the longest song on the record everything which features a pretty epic beat one of the most epic on the entire record also Kanye singing on the hook is legitimately beautiful as I have said in my reviews of kissy ghosts and also his record yay I do feel like Kanye has made the effort to improve his singing on this series of summer releases and it shows here too I also enjoy generally this song sentiment about wanting to change the world for the better also thinking for yourself and being an individual however I can't help but cringe at the series of bars that nas drops on this track that kind of come off a little anti-vaccination granted it doesn't get super conspiratorial in the way that they kick off it just kind of feels like nas is rapping from the standpoint of a concerned parent who despite the fact that studies show you should get your kids inoculated it still kind of hurts to see your kids getting a shot and oh they're in pain I don't want to see my kids upset so on and so forth but then there's a point at which he's rapping about oh we don't know what the side effects are going to be no no we we know what the side effects are going to be long has been studied the act of inoculating people against deadly diseases the side effect is that we don't all die of fucking smallpox and believe me this song is one of many examples on the rest of this record where it seems like nas's social commentary could be a lot sharper Adam and Eve does pick things up a little bit at least when Flo is concerned nas sounds a little more aggressive and hungrier than on many of the other tracks here I like some of the religious imagery that pops up in the track some of the themes of betrayal but unfortunately it's not really a track that thematically or conceptually hits quite as hard as like the the album's two intro cuts and that's kind of the other thing with this album it seems like for the rest of the project nas can't really dive into or deliver a song topic with the same vigor and excitement that he used to really kind of unpack an idea to the point where he's bringing a really interesting and a unique and a smart point of view to it the song simple things is kind of pleasant to listen to it's cute it shows nas and kind of an endearing light but it finishes the album off and more of a whimper than a bang I mean it pretty much contributes to the overall scattered and unfinished vibe of this album I guess you could say that Nasir is an admirable release there are some highlights there are some cool and interesting moments here and there but I mean I got to admit I think a lot of the time the production is kind of carrying nas and making the record interesting ultimately this album falls very short of kids egos or Daytona or yay in that I'm not really hearing the artist in a new light I'm not really hearing them push their craft to the edge or do it better than they've ever done it before in actuality Nasir is just kind of so-so it's just media it's just like barely getting to the bar of acceptability and then just kind of coasting from there I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a comment in the comments if you're feeling full of thoughts over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that up or the link subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Naz forever

FJwmTnjDkrI,hi everyone clear ffunny throat Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new blade album red light blade is a Swedish auto crooner and Drain gang member coming up off that hole yung lean wave fusing together elements of trap music alternative R&B cloud wrap he has a few releases under his belt so far though nothing has really stood out to me stop me in my tracks as I don't know I guess there wasn't really anything that that struck me as as being too unique about his sound in my cursory listens of his debut record the collaborative record that followed that not too long after but whenever he does manage to drop something I do get a lot of requests my morbid curiosity starts itching at me and and I guess this time it sort of got the better of me so I've been listening to this new album back to front and I'm just like what this is awful what is the selling point of this the only thing good about this record is the vaguely futuristic and dreamy production which is not that dynamic it's not that versatile it's all across the entire LP so you're kind of getting just one dimension here so even if I do enjoy the aesthetic of these beats for a few tracks it does tend to wear thin by the end of the project but still if this album were an instrumental record in my opinion it would be so much better I mean the very bright futuristic and carefree trap beats on this thing are pretty blissful sounding like a cross between like a Denzel curry instrumental and some vaporwave band camp but blade himself on this record is absolutely intolerable he sounds almost as lifeless tuneless flavorless in 1 dimensional as NAV the singing on this album if you'd call it that sounds near tone-deaf and there's really nothing in terms of like an interesting emotional display or like inflection or vocal virtuosity it's just kind of a really awkward awful young boy voice moaning away with just like a lot of auto-tune slathered on top and for a guy who sings for pretty much the entirety of this album I I don't really get the sense that he cares all that much about melody as pretty much all of the drivel that pours out of this dude's mouth across this project just sounds really thoughtless and off-the-cuff I've really only heard a few projects a few artists who are at this visibility level who are so beyond the help that auto-tune can provide for sure blade mostly abuses it for its aesthetic purposes not necessarily to fix the pitch of his voice but there are so many vocal and melodic blemishes all over the performances on this thing that the auto-tune just cannot cover it up in fact it makes it sound almost worse throwing the auto-tune on his voice is is kind of like I don't know having a scope but not a gun to put it on or you just bought a fresh set of guitar strings but you don't have a guitar I mean blade is consistently outshined by his guest singers on this project and they're not even really that much better than he is and it's not just how little effort it sounds like blade is putting into these tracks it's also that some of them are are kind of painful to listen to the song Golden Boy is kind of a prime example the vocal mixing is a little off the instrumental is much more quieter than the singing which when Laird gets really loud and starts to clip a little bit honestly on a few of the tracks here the mixing and the mastering is trash I mean I guess this album does have a certain awkward European who sits around all day getting high with his friends and consuming American media through the internet appeal to it so I'm sure some people will be able to relate to the attitude or the vibe of the album but if you're the kind of listener who actually goes into a song or a record looking to hear some decent mixing or a cool beat or some good singing or a song or I don't know funny or entertaining or interesting lyrics a versatile tracklist a unique bright personality yeah this album is probably not for you I haven't even really talked about the lyrics yet and I'm not gonna go too deep into them other than just to say that they're generally goofy as fuck which is clearly intentional but it's not really adding to the quality or the character to the album it only makes me feel stronger in my opinion that the whole record just kind of sounds like an extended piss-take however I don't think there's a lick of irony to what's happening on this thing I will commend blade on one thing with this record though this album and his sound in general would be nearly impossible to parody because you can't really take this into a humorous direction like you can't make the vocal sound worse you can't make the beats sound more rickety there's literally no way to tease a funny moment out of it by making a were sounding version again I thought that guest singers on here we're kind of tolerable and and the aesthetic of the instrumentals were pretty cool for at least the first few tracks but outside of that like god this album is just a barren wasteland to me as far as trying to find something of entertainment value I'm feeling a light too decent one on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next it the life you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comments in the comments if you're feeling angry Anthony Fantan o blaid red light forever 
uOLb73_zgVg,ah hi everyone Anthony tor tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new self-titled lump album it's a collaborative project between Laura Marling and Mike Lindsay as I said this is a new collaborative record featuring to UK musicians Laura is a seasoned songwriter with six solo albums under her belt at this point and a pretty distinct singing voice and style even if I think some of her latest stuff does see her getting a little predictable she has a very pensive and poetic songwriting style whose appeal I cannot deny a distinctly smoky voice to that surprisingly dynamic when she's performing a more energetic number and then there is Mike Lindsay who is one of the main brains in the band Tong an experimental folk outfit known for their fusions of electronic and acoustic instrumentation I remember loving their record good Aeros about a decade ago at this point this album came out around a time when the whole folk tronic trend was kind of at its peak it was a shame they weren't able to follow that record up with something that was as satisfying and bold however tong continues to release records to this day they even have one dropping this year I'm also kind of confused as to how this genre died out around the turn of this new decade because surely the broad idea of bringing electronic music and folk music together had more gas in the tank than like for Tet and Juana Molina and the books and Matt Bose I know that's not all the great records that came out in the genre over the years I'm just saying anyway I've been looking for a reason to be more excited about electronic funk fusions once again and lump has essentially provided me that opportunity this thing is a short little album it's seven tracks and the last track on this thing is a clever little credits track that sees Laura Marling kind of announcing all the personnel of the record over a trippy electronic sound bed the previous six tracks on this thing are a pretty satisfying set of complex and creatively layered and composed full tronic combos Marling and Lindsay really do pair well on this thing the experimental gently pulsating and beautiful musical backdrops on this thing provide a refreshing background for Marling to deliver her vocals over and then Lindsay who contributed to the bulk of these sprawling instrumentals he now has a call me strong and sensual voice to command attention amongst these really lush psychedelic and dense soundscapes the track late to the flight is the opening cut on this thing features some very lonesome acoustic guitar leads and woodwinds too that gently sprout up as Laura Marling his voice kind of beams down on them like a sunrise and the brighter she sings the more the instrumentation kind of comes alive the instrumental on this thing just gets fuller and fuller and fuller especially as its met with these droney beautiful multi-tracked orgasmic vocal harmonies the lyrics on the track seem to literally be about being late for a flight talking about details such as what you're wearing oh you're sitting next to kind of a normal experience but given a very surreal presentation filtering it through a lens that feel slow-motion dreamy and beautiful the song may I be the light miraculously is another track that sounds like morning's first ray of sunshine beaming down onto an open field of plants and flowers the track features this bustling meditative be matched with a droning sense and a set of vocals from Marling that are kind of hypnotic repetitive feels sort of like a chant Marling eventually starts delivering these beckoning lead vocals and then BAM [Music] this stunningly beautiful vocal line attached to some really great woodwinds pops in and just brightens up the whole mix I just wish the instrumental provided more oomph more support around this switch up around this chorus however I do enjoy the instrumental transition to the next cut on this thing though Rolling Thunder I much prefer this track for its slowly intensifying instrumentation Laura's strong guiding lead vocals on this thing and the incredibly noisy explosive and amazing crescendo of instrumentation toward the very finish curse of the contemporary is maybe the most instantaneously catchy cut of the whole bunch the instrumentation on this cut feels futuristic and strange but the swanky lead guitars and vocal melodies sound like something out of a 60 psycho 2 n-- with Laura Marling singing about being bored in California among other things the chilling and dark handhold hero is a nice emotional change of pace featuring Laura Marling singing a very dreary dirge atop these throbbing persistent synth arpeggios there's a suddenly industrial percussive shift on the retail into the track that I like quite a bit but this was another moment on the record that I felt like there could have been more acoustic instrumentation thrown in to kind of compliment Laura Marling style not only that but the instrumental could have been a little bit more dynamic to shake your shelter was unfortunately yet another song where I was much more impressed with Marling his vocals than I was the sound bed underneath her I think the watery guitar leads and very gentle rhythms kind of make for an awkward start on the song although I love the blissful metallic ringing tones that kind of bliss everything out and melt all the instrumentation together later in the track kind of making that that rough start worth it even though this record wasn't the groundbreaking fusion of sounds or the artistic pinnacle for both artists that I kind of hoped it would be it's still a texturally unique collaborative record with quite a few solid songs on it and maybe a reason to look forward as well because considering how many good tracks are on this thing even with it being so short maybe Lindsay and Marlene will get together again in the future I'm feeling a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please

tu41W2j52OY,uh hi everyone don't Finny leave Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new tropical fucks storm album a laughing death in me space this is the debut full-length album from Australian underground rock supergroup tropical fuck storm featuring members of bands such as Palm Springs and high-tension and the drones with Gareth lyddiard on guitar and vocals Fiona kitchen on bass and vocals Lauren Hamill on drums and Erica Dunn on guitar and keyboards and this thing is easily one of the most gnarly and electrifying and apocalyptic rock albums I've had the pleasure of listening to all year now if you're familiar with the parties involved and you've watched recent reviews of mine of Records like I see seaweed and feeling kind of free from the drums it shouldn't be surprising that you're going to hear elements of blues and art punk and noise rock on this album but despite being a band of average sized tropical fuck storm has managed to drum up this larger-than-life sound that also showcases elements of psychedelic rock and like some subtle industrial elements - there are a lot of linear song structures on this album that get progressively more and more intense as these tracks plot along with Gareth pulling off a lot of these really dejected and weary vocal performances whether he's singing or kind of narrating his way through a track and his vocals as well as the very hectic instrumentals on this thing are heavily enhanced by Fiona's very chirpy and bright sharp colourful vocal harmonies there are a lot of moments on this thing where the tracks have kind of a meditative pacing a very intense crescendo at the finish kind of like a great spiritualize track but then there's also maybe a dash of like birthday party and very early Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and the mix on this thing - also the combination of very gnarly and noisy guitars and kind of tortured and depressed male vocals and and these bright vocal harmonies hanging in the background reminds me a bit of a silver mountain Zion this record is something I feel like the post rock fans could definitely appreciate however this is not a post rock album there is not a tedious formulaic crescendo on this record to be heard it's like the gargantuan size of that genre but with all the cliched trash just kind of left on the side of the road also there are moments on here where I feel like I'm listening to an evil demented Arcade Fire like maybe this is how the band's album everything now would have sounded if the cultural commentary was actually on point and if Satan himself had produced it this thing is nine tracks long forty or so minutes and pretty much all the tracks on here find a very good balance of being cerebral heady thoughtful but also very raw and straightforward the song you let my tires down is a perfect opening statement on this record a track that features these thunderous riffs and strung out guitar leads that suddenly transition into a very subtle bed of drums and bass on top of which Lydia delivers these very weary vocals about somebody in his life who is in trouble with the law they wounded a rent-a-cop he has to kind of deal with this person's legal issues now that are going a little nutso cuz they're off their medication it's like a combination of a heartfelt ballad a seedy story with an incredibly blistering noise rock crescendo at the finish it's the kind of track that really just pulls your heartstrings but using like barbed wire the next track antimatter animals are where some of the more industrial elements on this record pop up with all of these fuzzy buzzy scuzzy bass and synth tones the beats sound heavily treated and very choppy very Bumi kind of like they were sniped and sampled and cycled over and over and over the track feels a lot less organic than its predecessor kind of like the band came up with a bunch of weird sounds in the studio and then sort of hodgepodge them together however it's no less thrilling to listen to than a lot of the other tracks on here in fact it's not too unlike a lot of the groovier and more electronic moments off of the drones last album feeling kind of free and there's something just deeply sinister about the sound and the music on this track that just feels like a long ago buried evil that is finally now rearing its ugly head if there's anything holding the track back it does have one of the more cumbersome grooves on the entire record I do think the pacing could have been a bit better however that's not as much of an issue on the Roaring chameleon paint which has these booming kick drums a bassline that lurks like a serial killer these warped and sliding guitar leads it all creates a very dark atmosphere meanwhile Lydiard his lead vocals kind of sound like they're drawled or kind of stumbling over themselves like he's drunk out of his mind and the lyrics portray this fanatical person kind of moralizing and shoving their ideology down other people's throats like a dick the sagely advice that they're kind of giving out is portrayed more as sagely abuse also the line on this thing about having a POV not making you an NGO really stuck with me and kind of said that this person clearly in their own head has deluded themselves into thinking what they're doing is for the greater good then the band changes gears with the incredibly tense and exhilarating the future of history which features more cartoony weird dissonant guitar leads and bass lines I feel like I'm watching a twisted animated short where the world is like burning to a cinder or maybe a meteor showers just blasting the planet into oblivion or a total nuclear holocaust which is not too far off base considering how apocalyptic violent and tongue-in-cheek a lot of the lyrics on this track are then there's the chilling soft power which lyrically seems to focus on how aggressive foreign policy across the world has gotten over the past few years of course in the lyrics there are a few obvious shots at Trump and why not I mean he's kind of contributed to this the track also features some of the most devilish guitar work on the entire record there's also an odd vocal break in the second half where it sounds almost literally like I'm listening to a long-lost musical transmission from like a bomb shelter it's a pretty dark moment on the album and then we have a very necessary instrumental breather immediately after this with the track shellfish toxin which features some like Beach sound effects and very eerie synthesizers it sounds like circus music if the world were the circus and tonight's entertainment was everyone's starving to death the title track is easily one of the most painfully sad moments on the entire record it's a bit of an aftermath kind of like the calm after the storm very evocative sound play it kind of sounds like the world's death rattle one of the more emotive vocal performances on the album - there's an incredible build of guitar and vocal harmonies at the very end of the track as well it's a track that I think could have been a perfect closer but then the album goes on to the song rubber bullies which is easily one of the blander and more long-winded tracks on the album not one of the more eventful instrumentally in my opinion though I do like the lyrics there are a few cuts on here that I think kind of get lost in their own chaos a little bit sure could have made a stronger statement in a more pointed way or could have I guess cut things down a little bit timewise and just been a bit more direct but outside of that I think this is a pretty great record there are lots of highlights on this thing very dark social commentary great performances good instrumental layering a very raw sound however pretty much every track on here sounds like it's been meticulously assembled so while it is a little rough around the edges it's an incredibly dynamic sound - I guess what's holding you back from feeling like this record is is as good as it could possibly be is that maybe it just didn't go far enough I mean there's some pretty big topics and discussions and issues being tackled on this record and as good as it is currently I feel like it's it's really only starting to scratch the surface things definitely could have been a bit more thematic or a conceptual or grandeur and scope still walking away from this album heavily impressed though feeling a light - decent ate on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling

paETFHcjTUg,hi everyone naughty naughty little boy here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Big Ups album two parts together this is the latest full-length album from New York indie rock noise rock and post-hardcore outfit big ups who have dropped two very solid albums thus far which I have given the very glowing reviews to 18 hours of static very wordy and intense art Punk record dropped back in 2014 it had a kind of aggressive yet abstract sound that I hope the band would stick to on future releases but instead the band went a more abstract but still equally enjoyable route on their next LP before a million universes a measurably darker and more mature release exploring the darker and moodier side of the math rock and post-hardcore genres pulling heavily on bands like Slynt now even though that record that follow-up was still a very good underground rock record I still had a feeling that the band still had room to improve and grow and sort of drum up their own sound in this particular style I mean sure they carried the torch for the sound really well wrote some really great tunes laid very good performances to tape sounded a lot like the band was taking this mid nineties experimental underground sound and making it a little bit more weird and adding some throat shredding screams onto it so with this new album over here I was just looking for progression I was looking for the next step in the band sound but two parts together kind of sees Big Ups no closer to doing that honestly in fact I think they're kind of drowning in their influences more than ever and as abstract as the band likes to play it on this new album quite a few of the songs on this thing are pretty formulaic relying heavily on this loud soft dynamic to make the tracks have any semblance of an appeal kind of lulling the audience into a stupor with very subtle very quiet very understated drums and guitars vocals that don't really go above the volume of a murmur and then all of a sudden the band will just busts in with this wall of guitars and just get right in your face with these animalistic vocals oh my god the heavy bass the pounding drums occasionally it does create a pelling moment on the album like the song trying to love which features this very eerie male/female vocal mix some very sparse drums and guitar lines that move through a few passages until we hit this really weird percussive bit that's bustling kind of tension building a heavy explosion of Rage at the midpoint of the song a very weary outro that I like a lot it's a good progression and again like one of the better tracks that sort of abuses this whole loud soft thing a few of the other cuts notably the the starting two songs feel so much less logical in their flow and their progression kind of disjointed comparably so the payoff the volume isn't quite as sweet on the closing track imaginary dog-walker the band actually drives their instrumentation down to the point of really pretty pretty much just silence before returning with one final buildup that's actually string backed and is pretty pretty beastial really the band does save the best for last on this one and then there are a few cuts on here that have these really tight kind of groovy guitar licks and bass lines very expressive drumming kind of sounds like something out of a Fugazi song on the songs PPP and tell them and as much as I love Fugazi one of the greatest bands of all time I can't really say that Big Ups really put their own twist on this whole thing the best of the direct cuts on this album though has to be the song fear which has some very sharp guitar phrasing a driving linear structure kind of almost has a krautrock vibe to it mixed with a dash of Mission of Burma especially toward the end of the track where you kind of get this psychedelic wall of guitar layers and vocal samples bass and drums easily the trickiest moment on the entire record as the mix generally on this thing is super super dry like all the instrumentation is very upfront very raw very crisp very organic the the mix really kind of berries or hides nothing leaves nothing up to the imagination it's really just kind of all right there naked as the day we all were when we came out of the womb so I certainly commend this album on that on it's very heavy sound on its organic performances on the handful of good tunes on here that they managed to deliver but also on this LP there are a few tracks that are super disjointed and not all that fulfilling there is a huge lack of refreshing ideas the vocals a lot of the time are pretty so-so and underwhelming and overall the runtime of this thing even though it is a tad longer than their debut I find it to be kind of meagre and as much as I enjoy the genre of music the band dabbles in this record to me just kind of feels like an exercise in nostalgia not really an attempt to build on the form or improve on past efforts because I just failed to see anything that this album does better than anything big ups have released up until this point you could even say it sounds like a far less interesting version of their last album as a result I'm feeling kind of a strong five to a light six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best

kXkSqBW2wTs,a hi everybody Iceman here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new 9th wonder in Black Thought EP streams of thought vol 1 EP this is a new EP from Philly rapper extraordinaire and the roots frontman black thought suddenly teaming up with legendary hip hop producer 9th wonder for a short collection of 5 tracks streams of thought vol 1 also to stream the thought I love that thought Black Thought loved that streams of thought vol 1 is there gonna be a vol 2 are we getting more of this please please say yes I have long been an admirer of black thoughts lyrical abilities the dude usually fucking kills it on his features and has been at the forefront of many an amazing roots album illud elf half life how I got over things fall apart undone game theory do you want more you should most definitely go back and listen to any of those albums if you haven't already but I wouldn't really say this EP reminds me of anyone roots record up until this point what it actually kind of reminds me of in tone is that amazing mind blowing cold blooded freestyle that he dropped with funk flex toward the very tail end of last year if you have not watched that freestyle what are you doing with your life the 5 tracks on this EP feel very similar in that it's pretty much black thought just spinning straight bars in a linear fashion not a lot in terms of song structure or anything like that again streams of thought it's just Bozz it's just Bozz of course there are a few great guests along the way to styles P Rhapsody whose latest record was really great as far as the production goes on this thing if you're familiar with 9th wonders work and you should be you can pretty much go into this EP expecting a bunch of meticulously chopped-up soul jazz and funk a few beats on this thing take a boom bap your tone more aggressive more hard-hitting others are a bit more mellow on the more aggressive side of things we have tracks like 9th verses thought and Dostoyevsky Black Thought does manage to break with the lack of a theme on this EP though on the final track thank you it's the most emotional point on the EP and the EPS lone topical track to with Black Thought getting very personal and nostalgic on the mic going back into his life and into his memory bank and pretty much thanking all of the people and places and things that got him to where he is today but outside of that pretty much every other song on this thing just sounds like a really in your face freestyle which I think only a very limited amount of rappers current day could do that on an EP and it's fireworks because with this heavy be steel voice and relentless flows black thought is just like a boxer just punch and relentlessly at the B and the quotables on this thing the quotables the quotables I'm electrical voltage not the regular dosage I'm too obsessive-compulsive I'm a fucking explosive mixed message in a bottle I left with the postman what obi-wan universe you owe me one solid my homie Gonzalez only no gun violence on the corner where they probably on the twenty one savage catch to in your cabbage young Cesar Chavez I'm a high priest and a wild beast once where you're now chief the mouthpiece to the far east damn Beast coast dude I said I've seen it all I had it all and I ain't mad at all this rapper tossed gravitas like a cannonball staying up all night throwing my sleep pattern off I need a doctor on call to keep adderall position on my commission is trilateral you fucking with me you tripping for trying that at all I mess around make a call get the get involved oh my god I know people it's a small world after all my credit cards say it's on word at the mall my broad looking like she's Cinderella at the ball reborn every day worried like a Capricorn from downtown no Ryan Lewis and McLemore also I love that one bar on here when he's like I'm hunter s Thompson I'm keeping it gonzo I also love this set of bars over here the diplomat pistol slap aristocrats any rapper coming for me i'ma send a missile back I mean sorry if I'm just like reading lyrics for the bulk of this review but like so much of what black thought says on this thing is sick as fuck just endless lyrical mayhem it's exciting its cutthroat its mean it's witty its brutal its hilarious just these dense verses for one track after another and it's a really nice kind of brief length to like a very nice tasty helping of lyricism just good performances good production just uh it's so nasty no real big complaints on this thing outside of just I I would like to hear more it's just a collection of tracks at the end of a but but a very high-quality collection of tracks and a fantastic collaboration - I mean 9th wonders beats complement Black Thought really well it's just kind of a match made in heaven and hopefully there's a volume 2 and maybe even 3 of this thing in the very near future I'm feeling a light 8 on this thing transition have you given this EP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a comment in the comments if you're feeling full of thoughts over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the links subscribe to the channel hit the bell is well Anthony Fantana Black Thought 9th wonder forever 
cMSJeU79b7Q,it's time for another y-you know review you know what we came here to do a bunch of albums that I couldn't review packed in a gauntlet just for you let's go into it nah yeah a lot of people been asking about this new Kyle album and and I don't know I appreciate the lane that he's in and I get that he's sort of on that whole super cheery upbeat bubblegum pop rap thing it's cool but I just don't see what he brings that an artists like Graham or chance or any League of equally happy-go-lucky chicago-based artists don't already I know DRAM is not from Chicago don't get up my ass about that I guess by comparison Kyle's music is a bit sweeter a bit more commercial I guess that's maybe enough of a difference for some people but for me it just kind of gives me a stomachache Craig Zen God this record if you're really into that dirty grimy three 6 mafia inspired sound that artists like suicide boys bring to the table if you like it with an extra helping of edgy vocals and you know maybe your ask our Lord fan or something like that you'll probably dig on this but I don't know given what I've heard before from those artists from similar artists that this doesn't stick out to me all that much I mean it's it's fine it's okay while I have enjoyed a few church's songs here and there I've never really been a giant fan of the group and and honestly this new record over here it's it's not converting me either it's their most glitzy smooth sanitary and commercially produced record yet a lot of those same new wave and synth pop elements still come through in their music but it's it's sounding more modern more contemporary than ever Lauren Mayberry still remains to be the best thing that churches has going as her vocal performances on this record are really passionate and exciting but I mostly find the production on this thing to be way too sanitary overblown commercially colored to me it just kind of sucks the humanity out some of these songs though in general I don't think this is a bad album I just don't really think it's for me when previous records from this guy got a lot of hype and attention I I just kind of failed to see the excitement and unfortunately that's also kind of my feelings on this new record over here I mean if you're really into hypnotic deep house with a lot of vocal appearances many of which are very relaxing and smooth I could see you appreciating this much more than me but for the most part I find a lot of the grooves on this thing to just progressively get more and more stale on nearly every track here the guest singers on this thing some of which I've enjoyed so much more in other contexts fail to really wow me or leave an impression I mean it's Pleasant while it's on but I just find the tracklist to be super bloated I don't really see why this record needs to be as long as it is and I'm just really failing to hear anything on this album whether it be the grooves the beats the sound play the progression the again the singing I'm just not hearing anything that makes this a truly crucial house album if you are huge into ambient techno break beat stuff a little bit of IDM I think you'll really enjoy this ski mask album it's pretty solid sticks to the style with a lot of heart a lot of focus personally I didn't really hear anything on the album that made him stick out to me as an artist like individually but you know if you're just really into music in that style and you just kind of want to hear more in it then certainly give this thing a shot I mean he definitely delivers a lot of material on this thing so you certainly get your bang for your buck if you decide to purchase it or just stream it for free somewhere as much as I am a fan of the work of bands like drive Like Jehu and rocket from the Crypt and hot snakes over here their latest album their first record in 14 years is just a tad underwhelming to me not nearly as raw a combination of post-hardcore and garage rock as their previous records were kind of seems like a little bit more laid-back indie rock rock and roll influences get mixed in here and they're just just not the exciting intensity of previous records kind of feels like your standard disappear for a long time and come back so much milder underground rock band comeback affair it's certainly listenable but not adrenaline pumping but this waka flocka flame mixtape has so much material on it and so little on it that feels like it really truly sticks out it is so dense I just wonder why he just threw so much so-so tracks out there yes it's just okay this is the debut album of this Michigan rapper I've been getting a lot of recommendations of over the past few weeks and I don't know I like the heart that this guy brings to the table there's a lot to his sound that reminds me of Chief Keef little herb you know that whole Chicago drill movement but I will say grizzly by comparison with this record is so much more commercial seems like he's got more of a focus group approached to the tracklist where he has certain features helping him chase for certain sounds and certain vibes on certain tracks so it's kind of a mix of everything he has this very raw delivery where he's not so much on the tempo of the tracks all the time kind of getting caught up in the aggression or the emotion of what he's saying and doing and he's certainly a cut above your average trap rapper in that he delivers quite a bit of introspection and storytelling on some of his tracks - he's not merely this mindless gangster rapper portraying violence for the sake of portraying violence there's quite a bit of room for reflection on some of these tracks so while yeah I get the sense that t grizzly is putting in more effort than the average trapper I still found his delivery and his flows into whole style to just be a little average kind of dime-a-dozen run-of-the-mill it seems like he's got a lot going on for him now though so maybe with the next release the next record he will come out with something that really Wow's me Stephen Malkmus of pavement fame new solo album and yeah I've never really been a big fan of his solo stuff and and I can't say that this record is changing my mind on that especially with so many humdrum plain-jane somewhat rough and lo-fi indie rock tunes on here without that much in the way of interesting lyrics there's some cool guests on a few of these songs that's nice although there is that really awful auto-tune detour a rattler that I would I would like to never hear that again ever yeah if you dig mount misses vibe but you're probably gonna get into this record but I just I just fail to see anything about this album that's really going to make it translate outside of the hardcore pavement camp that typically follows solo releases like these so race to 5/9 book of Ryan goddamn I'm get so many requests for this and I've been listening to the album again and again and kind of revisiting certain tracks and just kind of failing to get a grip of what's so exciting about this LP granted I do get and I do understand and I give Royce credit for this being like his most personal album yeah he dives so deeply into his mindset his family life his past his upbringing his childhood there's some really compelling stories all over this record but there are a lot of moments on here where he has upbeat tracks or popular tracks like some are on lock they just feel really out of place and unnecessary there are other songs on here like cocaine which while I love the story the singing in the hook just is really awkward and then there are moments like power which I don't know I can honestly see like Eminem performing this song and having it work on to his latest record obviously not from the standpoint of the literal story on the song but it feels equally as person and the flow is really tedious and there's kind of this really indignant angry delivery on there that I could see em pulling off just as well yeah it's just a little bloated it's a little all over the place it's a little overwrought I feel like this record would have been so much better if the instrumentals and hooks were much more on point and if the personal storytelling of the album was just a lot more focused so while yes I see the hype behind the record and I certainly respect the the immense amount of effort that Royce put into this album conceptually and just the amount of songs that are on this thing the album is still just so inconsistent to me and just doesn't land and that's gonna be I'm gonna leave it at that thank you

DbKWD0CYuX0,I hate shooting in the morning hi everyone wake phanie up Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new teairra wack album wack world this is the self released debut album from miswak a Philly rapper singer and songwriter who I happened into based off of a few personal recommendations in the DMS and those are recommendations I'm glad I took because I was pleasantly surprised by this thing by just how enjoyably artsy weird and cute this project was this thing is 15 tracks and 900 seconds long meaning that every single song on here ends at exactly one minute the whole thing just seems like a quirky musical challenge to pack all of these very short tracks with some semblance of a song but also to cover a lot of stylistic bases leave an impression on the listener and somehow make it all kind of work together as an album and even though the tracks on this record are kind of short I do think Terra puts a lot of effort into what she displays to the audience here it's not like I'm just listening to a random array of odds and ends if built out with a few more additional minutes of music a lot of the cuts on here could sound like really great full-fledged songs it's like I'm being subject to bunch of previews of tracks that I know if I heard the whole thing I would really love them still though I do appreciate the concept of what she's going for here and just from a stylistic standpoint from an aesthetic standpoint I can certainly recommend this project to fans of Tyler the creator or no-name or maybe DRAM some solo Kevin abstract I'd say Frank Ocean as well though it's kind of hard to dig into wax influences beyond her contemporaries because again the songs on here are so short that it's it's a little difficult to place it's kind of hard to get a full taste of what she's going for sometimes there's quite a bit of variety in the tracklist on this thing it's like a random array of contemporary or alternative R&B pop rap trap rap some autocrine stuff jazz and soul influences coming through on some of the chord Russians and vocal melodies and a lot of what's here seems to just kind of be filtered through this DIY bedroom pop lens there's also a super sharp sense of humor coming through on some of the instrumentation and especially the lyrics on this thing however that element of comedy that occasionally pops up it feels like it's kind of a mask for like a deep sense of sadness the tracks on this thing are just raw they're intimate their eclectic they're hilarious I kind of feel like I'm listening to a Moldy Peaches or a Kimya Dawson but for the SoundCloud generation now even though every track on this thing is just a minute long there are still some highlights the song cable guy which features these kind of stunning soulful lead vocals right at the start and then some very funny playful acronyms where she says MTV men touch vaginas B et bitches eat tacos on the very next track we get a total emotional and aesthetic change with these despondent watery pianos very Spacey minimal beat a touch of auto-tune on the vocals totally dejected vocal delivery saying things like if you love somebody I promise that you should tell them there's another line that stuck with me on here where she says selling white showing off she feels like she's Ellen the song hookers is a forlorn bit of synth funk where whack changes up her vocals yet again she's a bit of a vocal chameleon on this album this time she has kind of this mumbly slurred delivery it's really kind of the synths and the hard grooving beat on this track that steel the show that in the ching ching ching hook that is incredibly sharp however the track ends in the midst of like another repetition of this hook it's one of the many moments on this project that's just like uh why did it end I love it it's so endearing why does it have to be over but then again there are other tracks on here which feel somewhat satisfying with their one-minute length anyway and managed to leave a strong impression melodically or lyrically anyway like on hungry hippo which features a very bright glossy synthesizers wax singing about this guy liking her diamonds and her pearl and she says thank you ID assignment I also love the plinky pianos and rich background vocals on the track pets Emmett Herry lyrically wack kind of delivers like an ode to a dead pet with of course like some dog barking samples here and there it's it's like a really cartoony track and that's another thing about these songs a lot of them feel like these weird animated sketches like if you had approached a series of animators and told each one to come up with a little animated short within one minute some visual eye candy that's kind of how this album feels in a lot of respect it's like quick sweet distracting ear candy however within this very short amount of time while wack isn't really able to build much of a narrative or a story or a topical concept I think she does manage to reveal a lot about herself impact this record with personality I also dig the childish insults and weird alien sense and over-exaggerated redneck accent that she pulls out on the track buck off the 3/4 time signature and old-school doo-wop and R&B style guitars on silly Samer a nice change of pace - and I can't help but smile her singing and rapping about eating her vegetables on the song fruit salad as well yeah I'm not sure what else to say I just had a lot of fun with this project it's very straightforward it's very light-hearted it's very personal it's very youthful and bizarre kind of unorthodox and it's kind of got me waiting with bated breath for when she decides to come out with something a bit longer a bit more mature a bit more structured because things are already sounding pretty fun with in this very short window of time share there a few tracks here and there where she kind of drowns in her influences and they kind of breezed by because they sound maybe a bit too drenched in auto-tune the production is a bit too bland they're just not as much personality or eccentricity and I think I'm just gonna leave it at that I'm feeling a strong 6 - a light 7 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit

SMUocQXGbqc,why are you making me do this I thought I already reached my not good quota for the month you do it you're told little baby or you get that belt this new Godsmack album it's not good Boston Massachusetts alternative metal and post grunge outfit Godsmack they are back once the musical bane of my existence in high school as songs like whatever and keep away and awake were some of the most overplayed songs in rock radio history yeah I'm doing a bit Diary of a girl I'm doing a bit dad I can't I'm doing now go away the thing that kind of got to me about Godsmack over the years is that their songs felt so dark on the surface but yet we're so shallow once you got below that veneer a lot of their guitar work just kind of felt like an extended Alice in Chains ripoff meanwhile the singing of the band's frontman Sully mostly came off like a vastly inferior Eddie Vedder you know with all their but none of the real you know vocal prowess this is the band's seventh big commercial studio release and they've been consistently releasing albums over the years I just don't know what it is about this new album over here it just got the best of me it got my morbid curiosity I guess I was just really out to lunch on the Oracle and 1000hp and you know I'm really glad that I decided to take the plunge revisit with when legends rise because god this is this is quite the alt metal album it's pretty much a beautiful reminder of all the reasons the genre pretty much has died out the band is sounding more overproduce than ever and and there are multiple parts on this thing where they're kind of giving it to that typical millennial whoa whoa whoa whoa chorus style which is something that a band as edgy as Godsmack I never foresaw giving into and yet they do it so hard and for whatever reason the band's frontman Sully doesn't really have that gruff deep vocal tone that he once did it's kind of like he's singing in a higher register on this record his voice is sounding friendlier and more approachable than ever there's kind of a bright sheen on the band's sound generally on this album it's kind of like they turned into a born-again Christian alt rock band [Music] you know just basically everything on this record is so part of the course it's so predictable it's so average for Godsmack the subpar chunky and aggressive but not too aggressive guitar riffing all these lyrics about kind of rising and persevering so many lyrical cliches on this thing like about being bulletproof or you know shooting stars I mean they might as well be writing songs on this thing about looking into someone's eyes or flying away or coming or going home listen to these woes [Applause] [Music] it's so macho it's so damn macho I love how they took that millennial whoa whoa and then kind of turn it into a Viking chorus I have no idea why rock bands sort of do that filter on The Voice where you kind of get that distortion on it where it sounds like you're coming through like a loudspeaker or a McDonald's drive-through box it's like the least menacing thing ever it's been done over and over and over like hundreds of times at this point it's it's no longer an interesting effect there's another thing dogging me about this record and the song every part of me is one mere example of it but I feel like Godsmack is wearing their influences on their sleeves like harder than ever on this record it's not just the Pearl Jam and the Allison chains thing anymore like there are numerous tracks on this thing that sound like blatant Metallica ripoffs like not only are their solos on here that sound like Kirk Hammett solos there are riffs on here that sound like maybe load reload era Metallica but then there are vocal lines on this thing that sound totally James Hetfield and for sure Metallica has most likely been an influence on Godsmack for a long time as they have been for many metal bands but goddamn there are numerous tracks on this thing that just sound like blatant Metallica ripoffs and if you're gonna rip off Metallica why are you ripping off like one of the worst eras of their career you could do us all a favor and take us back to ride the lightning but no you you won't do that instead you're dropping tracks like take it to the edge which is easily one of the hardest songs on this entire record okay this sounds like a bad James that feel the pressure driving my fish down deep inside it oh yeah gonna take it to a whole new level in spite of your bullshit tasting sweet anxiety breaking through a melody maybe I just don't care anymore what you think of me what are these lyrics what are you taking your fish down deep inside of it just sounds kind of gross I'll take it to the edge I'll take it to the other side I'll hear you screaming he's coming alive if I'll take it to the edge I'll take it to the other side I feel it breathing down deep inside death is this song about giving birth I take it to the edge of course following this the bid cannot top this aggression they can't top taking it to the edge so with the song under your scars they slow it down with a piano ballad very necessary [Music] the song say my name later into the tracklist things get a little kinky I think with lyrics on here like you like the poison running through your veins you're addicted to the pain and the shame I'm chasing the same game every day who don't know your bullshit and your vanity a blind decisions no regrets a bittersweet of toxic sweat but where the kinky part comes in in my opinion is on the bridge where I think the band has has quite a funky breakdown you bring it down now I wanna turn around by now god I haven't heard anybody sing like that since the 90s I do have to give credit where it's deserved though the following track let it out I think is the album's one true bright moment of legitimately good songwriting and again maybe it's all still relative at the end of the day because I don't think the lyrics have improved that that greatly I mean letting it out is just as cliched a piece of imagery as nearly everything else on this album but I just feel like the vocal melody on this track is so pure Godsmack it doesn't feel like it's distilled from some other band that really nasty sinister chunky guitar riff you have those kind of dark and very moody and kind of eerie and foreboding vocals from Sully where I mean it Godsmack speak that that was kind of his trademark thing and the verse here actually transitions pretty well into the hook [Music] [Music] so let it out let it go I love that extra syllable he throws in there at the end of a one syllable word that's a lot of it to the the line I think that was the first time in a not good were legit gave a compliment to a record the band really does save one of the biggest and best for last with eye of the storm it's one of the more aggressive cuts on the record it's nice to hear that they're going out with a bang more than a whimper [Music] [Applause] [Music] god that makes you want to get a tribal in a motorcycle fuck ya drink Light beer get a wallet chain and beat the crap out of somebody for listening to car seat headrest but yet again this tractor sounds like a really bad Metallica leftover I mean if you would lie to me and told me that this was like load and reload b-sides and leftovers I might believe you I might believe you I might get a bit of an inkling that like hey this sort of sounds like Godsmack but I don't know maybe maybe Metallica was ripping them off or something I'm just not sure what else to say about this album it's a really really stereotypical it's really predictable the riffs are generic as hell the lyrics are generic as hell it's just so painfully average I just want the pain to stop I just want it to stop okay you did your jab you can say this guns Mac album it's not good 
9rkFbKVownA,"Hi everyone! AHHHHHH AHHHHHH AHHHHHH here, the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new self-titled project from Kanye West and Kid Cudi, Kids See Ghosts. Thus far it has been a very busy summer for producer, songwriter, singer, rapper Y-you know who he is, Kanye West Releasing several mini albums within weeks of one another the first of which, while not under his own name did feature his influence and production from front to back. Of course I am talking about Pusha T's Daytona, a 7 track album that just breached 20 minutes in length; all killer no filler. Then following that was Kanye West's new album, ""Ye"" Also 7 tracks, also just over 20 minutes. Equally to the point, though, not as aggressive and finely tuned as Daytona ""ye"" was also noticeably less extravagant and wildly experimental than Kanye's past several albums, too but to me this album still struck me as an incredibly unique and important moment for Ye in just how vulnerable and harrowing the material on this album is. To me this record felt like Kanye going through an ego withdrawal and showing the suicidal and self-destructive lows that fuel his god complex highs, which brings me to the third installment of Kanye related releases this summer Kids See Ghosts I had an inkling that this album wouldn't sound too much unlike the Ghost Town track off of Ye's latest album because it features Kid Cudi, ""Kids See Ghosts"", ""Ghost Town"", and there's also a song on this record titled, ""Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2)"" so there's clearly some kind of linkage going on here So, I kind of got to wondering will Kids See Ghosts be aesthetically similar to that Ghost Town track? Will we see a similar fusion of hip hop and guitar music, maybe even hip hop and rock not too much unlike Kid Cudi's WZRD project, which, I don't know, worries me because I didn't like that album too much Also, I was so skeptical going into this thing because a lot of Kid Cudi solo material has been painfully mediocre since Man on the Moon 2 And even though I've enjoyed yays recent releases, he's in such a state of volatility right now Who knows if he can keep this quality up also didn't Kid Cudi and Kanye like have a bit of a rocky Friendship thing lately that could affect this project too. So I did have reasons to be skeptical going into this album, but This record is amazing. It's just as brief as everything else Ye has touched so far this year at 23 minutes and 7 tracks, but it flows fantastically in its short run time feeling like a Full complete album to the point where kids see ghosts actually feels longer than it is It also sounds completely unlike anything. Kanye has dropped so far this year Really dropped ever and sure while as I predicted there are elements of hip hop and rock being fused on this thing There's so much more there are experimental hip hop elements being worked into this thing clearly some Madlib worship here and there and the Grunginess and the brevity of some of these instrumentals and songs. There's even a neo psychedelia edge on this album, too I catch whiffs of some Flaming Lips here and there some Yoshimi soft bulletin Embryonic and even the terror some shots of hard rock and pop and R&B and even grunge get worked into this thing, too occasionally on this record There are some flashes of classic Kanye but there are plenty of moments here too where he is as out there as ever especially with some of the eclectic sample choices one of which is a 1930s Christmas song another one being a Kurt Cobain sample typically on this thing Kanye comes off really manic wild out of control Cudi being really forlorn dejected. It's sort of like they're both taking the emotional and and mental problems that they are known for in their music putting out there in their music and sort of Forming them like Voltron together into this short But epic experimental hip-hop opus and in a huge contrast from Kanye's Ye record the production on this thing the verses nearly everything is so meticulously Assembled like the rawness the lo-fi Production the the feeling of lightning in a bottle the feeling that things on the record were just kind of cobbled together That does not carry over on a kid see ghosts at all I definitely get the sense that the songs on this thing were worked on for a very long time The music and the emotions on this thing are on the edge in every way imaginable for me this thing was mind-blowing on impact and Instantaneously catchy - we have the opening track on here feel the love featuring Pusha T Push drops are really expressive and flashy intro verse over these very somber synth chords right after these Distorted vocal leads from Kid Cudi being echoed out into oblivion *I can still feeel the looove* It's a really powerful refrain powerful mantra to kick the record off with not only that but Cuddy singing this loud this forcefully and also this on pitch Right at the start of the record is is a very good sign so far the song sounds pretty cool. Pretty low-key pretty trippy Strange surely. It's a great vibe, but I just did not see coming right around the corner at the end of this verse Kanye busting in and kind of simultaneously locking in with these gunshot snares that are marching away into the end of the song and over these snares she's going *Kra! Kra kra kra! Kra krrrra! Kra! Sounding like Mike Patton while the song builds up this sonic and rhythmic momentum the track suddenly melts into these dreary bass tones and guitar leads that Miraculously Kid Cudi's vocal lead still fits on top of even though this track is really short we've gone through the number of compositional Transitions that you usually hear in a song double its length the song just ends in such a powerful place Thanks to the performance the production really Everything the color the volume the texture it's all on high Fire is a much more low-key moment on the record the shortest song at 2 minutes and 20 seconds It shows Kanye and Cuddy doing their thing over these very gnarly and rough chunky and Twangy guitar samples some eerie woodwind leads to some psychedelic vocal samples and sound effects It doesn't hit as high as sonic Peak as some of the other songs on here, but I do feel like lyrically these are important moments for Kanye and Cudi as it seems like they're kind of Establishing the personality the vibe the brand of of this collaborative project I also think this track works really well as a depressive counterpoint to the intro cut There's also a marching quality to the percussion on this track to the persistent snare drums and tambourines *ba! ba! ba! ba! ba!* Pair that with the guitar sample and Cuddy's haunting humming Hanging in the back and the song essentially sounds to me like a pirate dirge but in the best way possible in the best way possible there's also something about Kanye's verse on this track that just reminds me of 2000s era Kanye. It's kind of like he's been resurrected But has a newer darker edge the song fourth dimension though struck me as the most Classic Kanye moment on the entire record this song features the kind of genius level beat production that reminds me of cuts like Jesus walks Kanye drops this hilariously explicit verse. Of course. It's about sex. I love the line in this verse when she tells him He's in the wrong hole and he says he's lost that uh, definitely got to me But also I love how Kanye sort of portrays sex as like this psychedelic experience talking about it as if it's like another dimension That I can definitely fuck with and the the line that he ends his verse with saying that if he goes to jail He won't finish the sin and then the rest of the verses just silence Then Cuddy's verse this dude has not sounded this cold-blooded since the 2000s and I just love the camaraderie that is coming through on this album between these guys Already before we've even hit the halfway point It's like Kanye and Kid Cudi are bringing the best out of one another on this record Reminding one another of what each other's strengths are because we know Kanye and Cudi are longtime Admirers of each other's work have inspired one another's work and it's like together in closed quarters on this record They each want to do whatever it is that makes one artist hold the other in such a high regard Because Cudi singing on this thing is more on point than it's been in years. Like he's so on pitch It's scary sometimes I think the shakiest vocal moment for him on this thing is some of the moaning at the start of the track reborn But it's not even really that bad but back to fourth dimension Cudi's bars on this thing are really Slick really trippy and I love the hilarious vocals snippet that sort of ends the song out talking about, you know Just have the music do this and that the other thing and then you know Just two and a half minutes, that's enough for a record. The song free is One of my favorites on here. I mean almost every song on this thing is a favorite of mine It's this crazy hard rock rap fusion. That's just Kanye and Cuddy go absolutely insane on this thing The track is a fantastic extension of some of the themes off the track ghost town throwing out this idea of freedom again And again and again and not just simply social or political freedom really a existential freedom freedom from pain freedom from like mortality the song features these blaring samples have chopped up hard rock guitars It sounds like something out of a Led Zeppelin song A lot of the instrumental though is owed to a very generous sample from a UK Instrumental hip hop producer who goes by the name of mr chop But even knowing that what Cuddy Kanye and ty dolla sign to do on top of this beat is incredible their gargantuan godlike proclamations of I feel FREEEEEEEEE Every single time Kanye and cutting shout that line. I feel like I'm being thrown down into a kaleidoscopic wormhole where all these colors are swirling around my brain ty dolla sign brings these Amazing vocal harmonies like these super dense super thick how many vocals are multi-tracked on top of each other it sounds so AAAAAH Even though ty dolla sign isn't delivering as extrema vocal performance as Kanye or Cuddy He sounds rock and roll as fuck. Again, Kanye sounds absolutely manic on this track. Kid Cudi less So but there's a bit of sass to some of what he delivers on the track Guess what babe? This song is not simply just a fantastic song by itself. It's also redemption for me, too Like it's a fantastic follow-up to ghost town it also sounds like what wizard should have been and the the the godlike vibe of this track the supernatural vibe of this track feels like something yeezus should have achieved reborn is an amazing and for Lauren cooled down after this cut Cudi singing truly makes the track and I love the songs lyrical themes of Moving forward and having no stress getting a clean slate beginning anew the need to hit the reset button once again Kanye drops a fantastic verse on this cut That is one of his most personal yet kind of echoing this very sentiment the haunting background vocals and cue piano and dusty beat may not sound like much just Listing them out But they do a whole lot with very little the refrain Cuddy ends with on this track too - I think adds a very powerful Sentiment to the song questioning which way should he go after either? Fucking up or going through this reborn process where maybe he's bound to make the same mistakes again Then there is the incredibly chilling title track which features the most Meditative instrumental on the entire record more supernatural vibes coming off of this track a really eerie synth lead. A spectral chord progression. Yes. Yngwie aka mos def Also featuring on this thing on the back end in a very wise and in Sage like short verse Kanye's verse is so great on this thing he comes through with so much authority and the finishing Cuddy montage just ends things off with Fireworks the strung out guitar that that basically makes up the bulk of the instrumental here, which is a Kurt Cobain sample It's kind of like Cuddy is taking those grunge vibes that he was trying to execute on speeding bullet to heaven But giving them the the song the platform they finally deserve also I love the way the track transitions from these dirty grimy lowdown verses to these heavenly Vocal harmonies with Cuddy singing out into the ether with a lot of reverb on his voice. Whoa Whoa, then all these incredibly eerie auto-tune vocal harmonies shoot back stay strong Lord shine a light on me, save me please. Damn, the vocal melodies. They put together on this track is just incredible Kanye's verse is fantastic on this thing too displaying this cycle of violence Like really one of his most conscious sets of bars and years this whole idea of asking or begging to be saved by this supernatural power for a record like this to me is a pretty powerful sentiment to end on I also love some of the psychedelics since that go into this track - again enhancing that neo psychedelic edge and just what a fantastic collection of tracks and I don't necessarily see this album as just simply being a standalone thing I very much see this record and ""Ye"" to be connected Somehow. Making it difficult for me personally to look at this and say oh, you know, it's just seven tracks It's just twenty minutes of music. No, I mean in the grander scheme of things, I feel like this album is very much tied to --Ye's recent release but the track listing on this thing is so Freakin watertight. There's not a song on this that I don't love - some agree or I don't think adds to the tracklisting fantastically every song builds on the next to create this overwhelming mind-altering and strangely beautiful vibe I truly feel like Kanye and Cuddy put one another artistically to the test on this thing with an amazing mix of emotion sound and genres all of which are super vivid just crashing into one another in this violently beautiful display It's like the cosmos imploding and reality melting and the The Matrix glitching and I'm also super impressed with how forward-thinking Difficult to pin down and futuristic. This album feels - I am legit feelin a strong 9 - a 10 on this thing What do you what do you think of that? *snoring* Hey, hey, what do you what do you is this is this exciting to you? Is this does this interest you at all? *more snoring* Well, I liked it I liked it a lot. Transition have you given this album a listen, did you love it? Did you hate it? What would you rate it?

Dr_9maz2Dwo,hi hi hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week

Carolina Pennsylvania as well all up and down the East Coast I'm sorry to those in the Midwest south and west coast we will get to you guys on the next set of dates that I do I cannot be sort of doing a gigantic across the country tour this whole this is this whole way I have a strict work schedule so you know but again there will be future tours in future groups of dates and we will make it happen so all right so so be there No be there at that shit not a drill starts this week I'm going out on the road it's gonna be a good ass time all right link down there below the needle drop calm slash tour four dates tickets information all that shit general mission and VIP tickets the VIP tickets are like an early meet and greet type of thing and we also give the VIPs an exclusive access to an exclusive piece of content day of show that is a very very fun piece of content that I think you guys will enjoy alright let's get into uh into the tracks of course our Amazon and turntable lab associate links are down there in the description to the turntable lab link you know use that one if you want to buy some colorful record pressings of albums I reviewed on the channel some turntables some audio equipment stuff we get kickback from it use that link when you buy stuff off that link and here we are the worst tracks of the week what are they oh no my boy Matty you may know him as the keyboard player from the jazz fusion futuristic jazz outfit bad bad not good he's kind of been dipping his toe into some solo ventures lately and I've heard a couple of tracks this is this being like the second or third that I've heard I think the second and this this cut is just kind of really overly reverb dreamy bedroom pop that I just don't really get much out of yeah I just feel like this is something that really needs to be retooled if it's gonna be more interesting I mean maybe at the end of the day this is just kind of a more widely appealing pop aesthetic that he's going for he doesn't want to just do the whole jazz thing forever or jazz funk hip-hop fusion stuff I appreciate that he's like you know trying some new stuff but um I'm not really crazy about these new these new solo cuts and then we had this a new song with Christina Aguilera featuring a gold link which is just just a terribly awkward pairing and I'm just not really sure what I don't know what what I think of it it just seems kind of like a drab and I don't know a drab tune with a feature that's just kind of into fitnah square peg into a round hole not only that but gold link seems to take over quite a bit of the song kind of making Christina play second fiddle on her own track yeah just just not really get a whole lot out of it all right let's move on to the tracks that I thought were meh thankfully not not a lot of tracks I dislike this week really new Smashing Pumpkins songs Solara the 3/4 of the Smashing Pumpkins have been back doing live dates and that sort of thing if you guys been paying attention to the rock and roll news and of course they've been going out on tour playing the hits playing the hits and now they're writing and recording music again and this new song while it's not as terrible is anything Billy Corgan has pretty much been doing lately with Billy Corgan and friends which is what Smashing Pumpkins has been for the past several years I don't know it's it's it's not crazy amazing either it just kind of sounds like they're trying to get back in touch with their somewhat grungy nineties roots you know I I won't turn up my nose at it sounds okay but is it one of the best Tunes I don't know I think if they continue down this road it may take a another couple of songs or at least maybe an entire album for them to kind of work out the kinks it does sound a little awkward and it does sound a little drab at this point but hey you know maybe they could find a way to sort of light a fire under its ass and make it exciting again moving on from there J Rock the bloodiest new single from Jay definitely much better and much less repetitive and tedious than his last single really could have used a stronger hook or lyrical topical point but still I think the production and the flows and lyricism on this track generally are really good so not really knocking it it's actually kind of got me a little bit more excited for this forthcoming album release truth be told and Norah Jones my heart is full new single from her although Norah unfortunately I mean I heard some decent cuts off of her last record III know I didn't really cover it in any depth or anything and I apologize for that but this this new single kind of took me off-guard is it just didn't really sound like in her usual style it just sort of came off to me as being just overly reverb dand somewhat bland artpop moving on from there oh this new axis artist if you're familiar with the whole kpop scene because you know we are continuing to do a little bit of coverage here and there the ongoing kpop take over the axis group has this new artist named Katy and who I you know has been in the music industry and South Korea for a little while now and she has this brand new track out titled remember and it is a hard-hitting and gargantuan and epic piece of like futuristic alternative R&B the music video is gorgeous and the the tune itself I mean there are some moments I don't really care for like some of the over glitzy and wonky synth breakdowns in the middle of the track but I like her vocals quite a bit and I think the tune itself is relatively solid moving on from there Interpol has new material out new record on the way my significant other loves Interpol she says she's crazy about the track I don't know if I'm as nutso about it it's titled the rover I like the vibe and I like the energy I like the direction the band is taking things and on this track it's much more exciting and exhilarating than anything that was on the band's past couple of Records in my opinion although I wouldn't say I'm like totally nuts for Paul banks vocals on this song they sound kind of shaky and warbly I mean he's a guy who's been singing for a long time I'm sure if his vocals sound like anything on this track it's 100% intentional although I'm not exactly sure if I'm really enjoying that new vocal direction but maybe it's something that will grow on me with the release of the new album if we hear more singing in this angle or maybe this track will just sound better in the tracklisting I don't know but it's it's not a bad cut it's not a bad cut certainly sounds like they're trying to shake things up a little bit and not just kind of given two expectations and I like that moving on from there gorillas have a new song out titled sorcerers and I don't know it sort of feels like a bit of a blend between the last two tracks and singles they drop not too long ago just sort of like a very synthetic very groovy very low-key piece of electronic pop not really a whole lot of high points not a winning hook there's not really anything texturally or melodically that kind of pops out of the song it just seems all very middling and so so it's certainly pleasant to listen to but everything is just very washy and bland and not all that interesting in it in my opinion I'm just not really sure what else to say about it it's just kind of a so-so cut maybe this will be a gorilla's ambient pop record or soft pop record I really have no idea and let's move on to the track so I thought really best tracks this week they're actually quite a few tracks this that I thought were great that really kind of wowed me and grabbed my attention vain I'm not gonna go too much in depth about this song I've talked about this band pretty much every week they have dropped a song from their forthcoming record it's almost like they're kind of spoiling the sound of the album at this point but if you haven't heard them yet this new song is titled doom tech check it out along with every other track I'm talking about down in the description where we link all of these songs the track again doom tech and if you're really into kind of that peak of 90s and 2000's metalcore Dillinger Escape Plan and some botch and of course some freaking converts and you're really gonna dig on what this band is doing every once in a while they put in some interesting and electronic edits in the production and that sort of thing to kind of break things up and make it a little bit more new and cutting edge and and forward-thinking and really looking forward to listening to and reviewing this new album when it drops very soon moving on from there serpent with feet seedless this project has been totally killing it when it comes to this completely seamless and futuristic and intergalactic blend of art pop with the avant-garde and electronic music and the lyrics of this particular track are so unsettling and I don't notice it it's it's like the demise of an emotional link sort of happening before my very ears it's it's a very sad tune and I don't know it's it's rare that an artist sound is so idiosyncratic and and just so off the beaten path it's difficult to describe with accuracy when it comes to kind of like initial impressions of a song for me but this project is definitely one like every time I listen to a new track from this project and this song is included it's always like wow you are so out there you are so fucking out there and I support you and your artistic rich so please please please do have your mind bent and listen to this shit thank you moving on from their new track from idols if you guys remember their last single Colossus I thought was a bit too slow heavy overwrought and I don't know just just not direct enough this new song over here Danny and Adele Co is very much the opposite the band has a new album on the way titled joy I believe and this song over here is a very positive very forward-thinking and a very topical track what sounds like to be a song pretty much about immigration and diversity in the UK kind of in response to the all of the anti-immigration notions going on in the UK and the whole breaks a thing and the music video obviously plays into that thematically as well featuring this kind of dorky weird kid dancing around and doing this okay and symbol around a very diverse array of people who happen to be in the video yeah I'm gonna leave it at that it's a very fun interesting song and I love hearing idols sort of putting out tracks are a little bit more throttling and a little bit more uh I I guess a socially aware and direct about their message to because if there was something about their last record that I didn't care for that much it was that it seemed like they had strong opinions on a myriad of issues but they would kind of couch them in language or in symbolism that kind of made it hard to sort of tease what they were getting at out this to me is so much more blunt but not so blunt it's just there's no poeta sysm to it it's it feels like really stupid or just like kind of preachy or something like that just seems like a good balance all right I'm gonna move on from there gang gang dance which is a group never really been crazy about before of its new song young boy America made in America is actually a really cool neo psychedelic dance track that does equal parts thrilling and chilling and it's really loving the production in the lead vocals the grooves a lot of great things about this track and I think this is like the first time I've looked forward to a gang gang dance I probably should be covering this thing once I get back from tour dish loaf and Leon bridges liberated newid is loaf single over here and yeah I mean at one point I just thought she was gonna end up being a one-hit wonder and it wasn't really gonna go anywhere from that that one YouTube hit that she had that sort of blew her up and I don't remember the title of it at this point but to me this new single over here is great like her singing has improved Leon bridges totally kills it it's fantastic production and I love the sentiment and the message of the song to the whole you know positivity love yourself so on and so forth message of the track music video is gorgeous as well just all in all just a very tasteful uplifting tune that I think has a lot of great qualities to it it's awesome to see her kind of taking some risks putting out tracks that are not only infectious poppy but also thoughtful and maturing as an artist too because I don't know for her to kind of get swallowed up into that whole gimmicky trap trend it sort of seemed like that couldn't have just sort of been what she was all about you know what I mean and I'm glad that she's sort of showing her true colors here and kind of really making music that's saying something and making music that sinks something something that sounds great so moving on from there Death Grips hahaha I'll admit this song took a couple of listens to really kind of get used to because there are some very odd elements of it it is really as odd as the black paint cut that I enjoyed quite a bit it's very trippy it's very psychedelic there there are some weird samples of Death Grips themselves like that destroyer line right at the start I think it's from the song lock your doors and rides vocals for the majority of the track sort of seemed buried under this very bustling and the strange production the drums seem very free and loosely improvised at some points there are these blaring three chord guitar progressions like that pop into the mix every once in a while on the hook and there's some like DJ scratching noises that pop in as well it's insane it's and it's sort of like everything but the kitchen sink and it's like they're just kind of weighing their songs down and then with all this like Sonic muck in with this track and and I guess the past couple of others too I that this may be Death Grips most maximal albums so far and I think if all of the singles so far indicated that they're going in a direction it's it's that so I don't know it'll be interesting to see how all this stuff pans out moving on from there and a Calvi whose career I've been following for a little bit up until this point her music has always had it's super bright spots super bold spots but then there are also moments that feel equally underwhelming to me this new project of hers look like it looks like it's it's gonna be pretty pretty nasty and this this single and music video she's just dropped from it don't beat the girl out of my boy is incredible it's like a cool little alternative rock song with some badass guitars and some very bold lead vocals and I love the lyrics I love the sentiment of the song a lot it's wild it's totally crazy Oh shout out to Austin yo this dude donated like a super chat during a recent livestream and he's like hey check out my check out my pop music and people sometimes suggest their own music during these live streams and you know me and the people listening check them out and sometimes it's not so good and sometimes it is good and this is one of those moments was like actually really good and the dude had soundcloud page and a music video for the song as well so so dude came prepared dude did his homework okay didn't do didn't just hand me like some kind of shit demo from whatever place would allow him to upload it like this is like a fully fleshed out filled out finished like little funny alternative dance pop tune with some funky dancing in the music video and some amateurish but endearing lead vocals and a very good production very good beat so again nice little a piece of romantic alternative dancey pop moving on from there shout-out to 88 rising for this track mid-summer fucking madness Summer Jam of the year Oh God tons of people from the 88 rising roster are on this track so it's kind of like this big group who were making our summer song jouji is on the hook of this thing and totally fucking kills it on the vocals though Oh like dudes really going there and they're into his upper register hitting notes hitting g-spot notes I didn't even know the dudes voice could hit and she's a great beat nice little I think like some acoustic guitars in there too it's very pretty it's very a blissful and I don't just uh seems like they went into it saying we got to make the jam of the summer and and certainly this should go down as one of the jams of the summer because it's a really good fun quality track and yeah that is it that is the weekly track roundup reminding you again tour this week the needle drop calm slash tour the needle drop calm slash tour okay it's gonna be a good time come on dog and love you love you love you again all the songs everything I've talked about down there in the description box and I'll catch you in the next video Anthony Fantino tor tor tor forever

34oyVszwnJk,ooh ooh hi everyone who thony Oh Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new father John misty album God's favorite customer this is the latest full-length LP from singer/songwriter Josh Tillman aka father John misty Coppertone Winfrey no proper drawn whiskey mm-hmm no farmer Don Henley shut up shut up okay I thought about killing you today I thought about killing you I've also thought about killing myself and I love myself so I have no issue with thinking about killing you you're so mean I was just joking what's wrong with you so this is Tillman's fourth full-length LP and it's his follow-up to what was my album of the year last year the father John misty record pure comedy a record that was a fantastically grim piece of social satire with a lot of wit and balladry in heart however a lot of other publications and listeners didn't didn't so much seem to think so finding the album and Josh Tillman's performance to be very bloated and dreary and kind of pretentious and I will admit this album I love it but it is kind of a slog but you know hey an ode to humanity's path of self-destruction takes time so how do you follow up such an album a record that is easily your most epic and ambitious artistic statement to date and yet it wasn't really all that well-received by a lot of the people who loved your previous material I will say though in Josh's defense on this album there were several lyrical nods to people not taking to this new direction it's sort of sad to see the album going underappreciated but surely he was aware of what was going to happen here in the end it would have looked sillier to see Josh predicting under performance for this album in the face of great fanfare now unfortunately Josh's answer to the follow-up question with God's favorite customer to me is kind of play it safe go back to more song lengths and don't get so political revisit themes that fans enjoyed so much more on previous releases like relationship issues humorous character portrayal is a few playful nods to God and religion it also wouldn't be a father John misty record without him going super meta at least a few times and kind of breaking down the fourth wall but I will say even though josh has decided not to go all out on this latest record he mostly does maintain the same grand instrumental presence that pure comedy had the tracklist on this thing has a great flow a very strong start a lot of dark ballads matched with very appropriate pick me ups to kind of add balance and even though this record is not as loaded with social commentary as its predecessor I kind of see it as an equally grim release which sees Josh exploring some incredibly dark corners of his mind on tracks like please don't die and the palace and if there is a thematic thread that pulls a great deal of this album together it's that it's Josh's mental state it's depression its substance abuse its how these things are affecting his marriage and it's also suicide with lots of lavish instrumentation more straightforward tunes and a more personal focus lyrically no doubt this album is going to appeal to a wider array of people and it seems like the reception and the reviews so far reflect that heavily but really at what cost because while I like this record quite a bit I also kind of feel like I'm being pandered too I don't know exactly what's driving it is the lack of breathing room between this record and its predecessor or something else either way it just kind of feels like josh is simply going back to what he already knows works what he already knows the audience receives well as some of the tunes on this thing just feel kind of typical for Josh because when it comes to the instrumental palette the aesthetics some of the melodies chord progressions I get a lot of musical deja vu on GFC it's just kind of unfortunate that Josh wasn't able to drum up a more distinct sound and personality for this album given that the matically it's very different from everything that he has released previously sure while josh has addressed issues like depression in the passed in song this record feels like it's trying to be more of a deep dive into his psyche I mean this is the first father John misty album to have Tillman pictured right on the front cover and that's mostly because he is the subject of this record and not just in the sense that josh is playing the narrator or a character in his own song I mean the tracks on this thing feel more like a meta-analysis or in autopsy so while I embrace the thematic direction josh is going in on this thing there are moments where the sound of this album leaves me feeling like I'm listening to a meager but personal extension of his last album or their moments on the album where I feel like he doesn't really nail it he fails to bring the audience a truly unique view on the issue of course they're still highlights all throughout the album though the song mr. Tillman is dark it's charismatic it's hilarious it's well produced it's sung from the standpoint of like some hotel lobby employee expressing concern for Tillman's erratic and strange behavior I love the folk rock guitars and drums and heavy piano on this track there are some beautiful vocal layers on this track too and a very smart nod to singer-songwriter Jason Isbell the song just dumb enough to try is another favorite of mine on here and features these dramatic and beautiful piano chords and acoustic guitar arpeggios the track is essentially about Josh's mental and emotional issues driving a wedge in the relationship between him and his wife with a lot of the lyrics of this song portraying Josh as inadequate as a partner as a lover the song is essentially an emotional build-up to Josh kind of gaining the courage to get his back together try to make this thing work and essentially start his life again I thought the song date night was pretty great too despite it being such an oddball in the tracklisting it's a short vignette sized piece of funky desert rock with kind of low fight drums that sound panned all the way to one side high-pitched vocal harmonies that sound like something out of a Queens of the Stone Age song in between these moments josh delivers this kind of deadpan talk singing where he's really on his Lou Reed the lyrics read a lot like a funny surreal trip or something which kind of shows the duality of Josh's mental state on this record you had these blissful abstract highs and then plenty of lucid dejected depressing lows please don't die as a beautiful ballad but also really harrowing as well as the song is sung in part from the standpoint of his significant other basically begging him not to kill himself the song is pretty powerful and all about the devastation she would feel if she were to lose him in a lot of ways the track reminds me of that smoochy cut from pure comedy last year which was essentially about Josh's wife comforting him or kind of you know talking him back from the ledge whenever he would be in a depressive state the genius and gorgeous title track on this thing sees Josh kind of addressing his religious background acknowledging that he's pretty much lost touch with it but then coming back and and calling on it in order to I guess find some sort of sanctuary from the mental and personal demons that he's dealing with he's calling on God in his time of need reminding God that hey I was really religious way back when I was I was your favorite customer there is a wonderful vocal performance from wise blood and the last leg of the track she sort of comes in provides this really angelic and haunting background vocal to Josh's tune that is really one of the highest points on the record now with all that being said there are a few low points on the album for me as well I didn't really like the track disappointing diamonds at all as a teaser it makes a lot more sense in the track listing because it sounds like a very peppy segue moment but I still find the very bumi and maxed out instrumentation and falsetto vocal harmonies to be a really hideous sound I do give the track points though for having incredibly interesting lyrics though where josh is essentially singing an ode to flawed love talking about how something perfect or that lasts forever probably isn't that special anyway songs like the palace and the songwriter I'm a little conflicted with musically I feel like Josh is treading water but I do enjoy the sentiments the messages of these songs on the palace Josh essentially portrays himself as being holed up in a hotel room doing drugs being afraid to leave but I feel like the sadness and the tension of this moment doesn't really come through in Josh's performance outside of the very weary vocal delivery that he has on board when he sings that in over his head refrain overall to me the song just feels like a mild snapshot of what could have been an incredibly interesting and manic moment on the record the songwriter as well to me musically feels a little uninspired a little drab but again I enjoy the lyrics I enjoy the sentiment the concept of the song Josh getting down to the crux of Fame performer subject artist addressing his wife as his muse and kind of throwing this hypothetical out there where what would happen if we switched places would you be as honest and constantly mining our relationship in our private life for source material for your music in the way that I do in that sense the song seems almost like an apology for throwing the intimate details of their life out there in his music and where only people is such a painfully flaccid closing track the lyrics during the first leg of the song are easily the most uninspired on the entire record like people what's the deal it reads like a Jerry Seinfeld stand-up routine and and basically gets to the heart of almost nothing you've been hurt I've been hurt what do we do now mm-hmm I feel like Josh was addressing these exact issues on his last record but in such greater detail it feels like there's something here but whatever it is Josh isn't really getting at it and it feels like he's not even trying to like he's dumbing it down for the audience or something I think the last few stanzas of the song are pretty poetic but it just kind of feels like too little too late at that point there are some subtle suicidal themes on the track as well so I guess that kind of ties in with the rest of the record too but the track just feels like a cliffhanger with no incentive to stick around for part two overall I like this album quite a bit there are a lot of great tracks on it but I can't help but feel like Josh's punching under his weight a little bit it's not quite as focused or fulfilling as it could have been but concept is a little too disheveled despite some of the very heavy and personal topics of this record occasionally it feels like josh is just scratching the surface it's not amazing but it's very good and and very good bye Josh Tillman standards and above average Josh Tillman album is still going to be leagues better than

CV1Ybh8v21k,uh hi everyone $15 minimum wage here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new OneNote Rick's point never album age of this is the latest full-length album from electronic and experimental music producer Daniel laputan aka OneNote Rick's point never a guy who thus far has had one of the most versatile careers of any artist cut from his cloth covering the basis of drone and progressive electronic music ambient post-industrial glitch plunder phonics and that's just under the 106 point never named we're not even getting into his electronic improvisational stuff or his vaporwave material recently under the OPI name daniel has dropped some pretty cutting-edge music replicas garden of delete r+ 7 the last of which there's is maybe my least favorite of the three but I see why the fans love it he's pretty much been on a streak lately so there's really no reason not to go into this new album over here excited especially with this incredibly odd album cover there was also a lead single from this album titled black snow which didn't blow me away but nevertheless I found intriguing it was a really strange mix of MIDI music and new-age and art pop featured a kind of rare lead vocal very naked lead vocal from Daniel himself and as to be expected because of this track but also because Daniel tends to reinvent himself with each new release he does break at least a little new ground for himself on this record as some of the songs on this thing features some pretty prominent lead vocals as well as like I said the whole new age thing some classical undertones get worked in occasionally as well especially on the incredibly gorgeous and regal introductory track but overall a lot of the tracks on this thing kind of make me think this is music that I would hear if I were to attend like a cult meeting for a particular cult whose whose message was a super futuristic and utopian as a lot of the compositions and instrumentation on this thing has a very synthetic glossy and idyllic vibe which Daniel occasionally undercuts with some weird compositional twists and turns or warped instrumentation or distortion glitches intentionally messing with some of the images of perfection and annotation that I think a lot of the music on this record brings and I like that characteristic I think it's a cool idea however I fail to see Daniel following all the way through with it from beginning to end on this album truth be told I think this is one of his most inconsistent albums in a while not only that but some of the ideas on this thing sort of sound like an idealistic and a cult take on some of the sounds that he had drummed up on his previous record garden of delete which the station is kind of a prime example of the plucky and hypnotic MIDI guitars on this track are pretty refreshing but the heavily processed lead vocals on this track sound like again something that could have been on garden of delete the compositional style is eerily familiar as well and then there's that weird instrumental shift in the back end of this track that features some melting synth layers that could have been worked into his last major release in the ambient genre or eternal but that's the other thing with this record more than any other OPN album in recent memory this is very much in everything but the kitchen sink album because you have moments on this thing like Babylon which is a painfully awkward futuristic art pop track with downright dreadful and boring lead vocals encased in these way too washed out since this exists on the same album as the dark industrial and percussive we'll take it and it's not like the flow from one track to the next between these two songs is that logical either this album is littered with 1-minute detours vocal appearances from the likes of an Oni and korean twitch while they're good they do kind of inadvertently add to the lack of cohesion among these tracks I mean there's futuristic pop on this thing apocalyptic post-industrial moody MIDI jazz all of which kind of break up the vaguely new-age aesthetic that quite a few tracks on this thing bring I mean they're highlights on here but I just failed to see how it all ties together the tracks on this thing feel even more disconnected from one another than the material on replicas which is crazy considering just how wide and varied the source material Daniel sampled on that record was I also think our plus seven is a more cohesive record - despite the point of that album being to create these separate sonic objects with each song at least all the tracks on that album shared a similarly abstract aesthetic age' doesn't seem had much of a clear progression or focal point it's more like potpourri and as a result even though there are good tracks on this release they don't really build on one another all that well still I do enjoy tracks on this thing such as toys - which features this strangely beautiful and inspiring lead synth melody whose Tam bird is is a lot like that of I don't know an alien reed instrument all of these are being supported by these epic and ascending keyboard arpeggios and glitchy percussion it sounds like a piece of music from a movie score where humans are embroiled in an ongoing war with like an alien species and one person breaks from the culture of hate to reach across enemy lines and befriend the aliens and understand their culture and realize that they're just sentient beings with wants and desires and needs much like ourselves directed by James Cameron eventually the music on this track shifts into the kind of disjointed sense escapes that I loved so much on Daniels replica record but with a softer and more futuristic edge I also enjoy the song warning quite a bit - which has these tense eerie staccato synthesizers eventually the tension of these scents builds up into a really abrasive vocal appearance from Dominic Fernau aka per ant the track is short but unsettling and twisted the song shame featuring some vocals from an Oni has some absolutely insane vocal layering it's the kind of sampling and twisted sound play I typically expect out of like an orange milk records release but the instrumental density of this track is almost like on an orchestral level not only that but the song is kind of finished off with this high-gloss new-age finish there are some abrasive shots of noise in the mix too as well as psychedelic delays this track for me is like peak cult vibes on the album it's like listening to a religious chant I also love the song ray Katz which is this incredibly gorgeous and complex MIDI string piece it is a wonderfully dynamic and sprawling piece which I think goes to show just how much daniel's sound design abilities have advanced in the past five years it's just unfortunate that he's showcasing this talent on one of his least consistent albums in a while the songs still stuff that doesn't happen also features a note knee and sounds like a moody mix of MIDI electronics art pop and jazz all set in the waiting room for purgatory in the year 3000 and then the closing track the last known image of a song really lives up to its title and that it feels like more of an impression of a song than an actual song it feels almost like Daniel is taking a replica esque approach to this track in that he may be composing a song and then chopping that track up sampling it and then putting like a new-age jazz finish on it personally I think there are a lot of interesting highlights on this album these sounds on this thing are vivid luscious gorgeous it's like abstract ear candy at its highest points I think Daniels sound crafty and Composition efforts for the most part are pretty good on here too but I still can't help but feel like the overall lack of focus cohesion as well as some of the more vocal led tracks on this thing going over like gangbusters these things are really kind of holding age of back from its true potential I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given age of a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the links subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana won at Rick's point never for ever 
lZp0ZTzHCuQ,ah hi everybody rainy thneed a tan out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new juice world album goodbye and good riddance this is the debut commercial full-length album of Chicago based trap balladeer juice world who is hitting it kind of big right now with the lyrical lemonade crowd and he's not your typical auto crooner in comparison with a lot of his contemporaries he's a lot more tortured and depressing a bit darker and more heartbroken you could draw a lot of artistic parallels between this and a lot of the Moody Spacey trap sounds that we've been hearing artists explore over the past few years but juice seems to consciously be mixing these sounds with elements of emo emo music which comes partially from his very boyish and kind of whiny vocal delivery also from the melodies that he chooses to sing of course these emo vibes pour through on the lyrics in his songs too I still see your shadows in my room can't take back the love that I gave you it's to the point where I love and I hate you and I cannot change you so I must replace you oh there are a lot of very clear and recurring themes on this thing of having a broken heart and having trust issues I mean there's even a track on here titled all girls are the same also take these lyrics from the song use to I've been drinking and driving and survive and take my sorrow and bear me alive in it wear your best dress girl cuz you're gonna die hit it bet you regret the day you lied in it when I'm listening through a lot of these tracks I kind of get part emotional trauma but also part unintentional hilarity because the lyrics are just so goddamn melodramatic especially with the twinkly little guitar samples laced into this particular instrumental also from the song heard me sticks and stones may break my bones but the drugs won't hurt me the drugs won't hurt me ex-girlfriend keeps calling my phone but the bitch can't hurt me so I'm not worried he's just an emotional boy okay he's just a young emotional boy but what's funny about this track and a lot of others on here the melodies on this thing just really seared themselves into my brain after just a couple of listens I enjoy a bulk of the lyrics on this album for a mix of different reasons sometimes I think they're so bad that they're good other times I think that they are legitimately compelling but truth be told they are not very deep poetic or profound given their subject matters of relationships and emotional issues even when juice breaks the fourth wall on a track and shows a hint of self-awareness he fails to really add another dimension to what exactly it is he's doing like when he sings listen to my story it's depressing heartbreak mixed with the drugs not the best thing devil trying to test me I'm failing and hailing you took it all back so while no I don't doubt that juice world has had his heart broken or done the drugs he sings about in his songs he just kind of takes a very surface level and reductive approach to these topics which in a way I guess is kind of in line with his emo and trap roots because there's a lot of crappy emo music out there that's not really that deep it's like a fake deep cry for attention basically white suburban men pretending to be a wounded bird emotionally to get the attention of women there have been a lot of artists taking this whole trap thing into a more melodic direction lately and juice world certainly takes a lot of cues from people like young thug and Uzi vert and little yachty and juice world is far from the first person to go emo or rock or metal with this sound either probably the most recent and most popular example of this has to be the late little peep who in his music also explored similar themes of addiction and depression and love on the rocks on good riddance there are a handful of very good highlights typically when juice brings a very good beat a melody a tune some decent lyrics my favorite in the tracklisting surprisingly may be the song black and white I don't know what it is about this song is that the nostalgic toy music box synthesizers is that the way juices vocals break as he sings in like an upper register at the intro of the song is it the lyrics about him and his friends just kind of commiserating and doing drugs together I'm in my white Benz and I'm doing codeine with my white friends it's just something so freaking infectious about this track it kind of gets me choked up too I also dig the song candles quite a bit - I love the dense layers of auto-tune vocal harmonies on this track and there's something really odd about the groove and the rhythmic pacing of the vocal melody on the hook of this thing now even though there are some tracks on this thing that I legitimately love and sort of make me look forward to hopefully a brighter future for juice world there are plenty of cuts on here where I think vocally emotionally lyrically he does go a little overboard bordering on being obnoxious or just kind of feeling like the sadness of this record is very forced the song I'm still features one of the worst vocal melodies on the hook of the entire record meanwhile reading into the lyrics of scared of love feels similar to that of like diving into a really bad cringy teenage diary entry there are other low points on here like the half-hearted hook on the track long gone or the really awful and basic similes on the song end of the road there are also a few tracks on here where it sounds like the mixing could use a little bit of work because occasionally there's a song here and there that sounds noticeably more lo-fi than the rest of the cuts on the record and on top of that across the length of the entire album juice world comes off kind of one-dimensional there isn't a whole lot of depth to what exactly he does even if it is pretty great in small doses on particular tracks because by the halfway point of this thing I mean he's kind of exhausted his whole shtick I'd say this album is mildly entertaining at points but just super inconsistent very much a mixed bag pretty shallow too but I can still walk away from this record having loved at least a couple of songs on it I'm feeling a strong five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best watch a dire view next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't die put put a comment in the comments if you're feeling full of thoughts over here next to my head is a another video you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana juice world forever 
ixElcxn6PlQ,no theny wait a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Kanye West album yay this is the eighth studio album from Chicago native rapper songwriter singer visionary meme provocateur Kardashian cohabit er mr. Kanye West now like usual with a kanye album there was a kind of tumultuous lead-up to the release of this album which of course we have to untangle for a little bit before we talk about the material on this record itself earlier this year Kanye West made a return to Twitter and started frantically dropping all of these weird motivational tweets many of which his fans got behind I guess it felt kind of cool to be caught up in Kanye's mind-state during the creative process of this record but then things kind of took a turn for the worst on Twitter when Kanye started endorsing Donald Trump and wearing the maggot hat then doing one erratic interview after another where his words just didn't really make all that much sense it became painfully clear that he didn't really know a lot about what he was talking about so the past couple of weeks for Kanye have yes been exciting but also very revealing embarrassing and very concerning to of course this is not the first time Kanye's contrarian tendencies have gotten him in hot water or had turned his fans against him so in concept what was happening wasn't altogether new however after the Charlamagne and TMZ interviews it did kind of feel like he was heading toward some kind of point of no return where he was either going against the grain just to go against it or making a fool of himself for attention not only that but there were a few weird non-album tracks released prior to this album that seemed to deal directly in this sort of social media storm Kanye had drummed up for himself the one he did with ti a versus the people was particularly cringy where he kind of tries to work through the mental gymnastics that brought him to this point where he was endorsing Trump on Twitter and then reflecting on the backlash for that with TI kind of playing to him it's also been reported since the TMZ interview since Kanye's 400 years of slavery comment he actually redid quite a bit of the music on this album which given that some of these very recent events are laced into the lyrics of a few parts on this record that's uh I don't know more or less believable but just like yay advertised weeks and weeks and weeks ago this latest record of his is a seven track release and it lasts just 24 minutes in a way it feels very much in league with his recent collaboration with push a tee Daytona which was similarly short sweet and direct which is one thing for push a tee to do a record like this it's an entirely different thing for Kanye to do it because yeah is totally stripped of the extravagance we typically get out of a Kanye release at least a newer Kanye release all the extra bells and whistles and guests I mean there are a few here but there's not really a whole lot on this record that sounds as larger-than-life as anything off of tila or yeezus or My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy not only that but this record does kind of feel like it was pulled together in a relatively short amount of time and honestly for Kanye I kind of find this record to be a refreshing direction because it's been such a long time since we've heard Kanye in the raw like this in such an unfiltered state and not just emotionally but also sonically with a bulk of the production on this thing being handled by him and frequent collaborator Mike Dean who yeh has been making tracks with for so long no doubt he's playing a very supportive role in this release and we also have a little additional production on this thing from apex Martin and Jay Pope and Benny Blanco as well as Francis and lights however the instrumentals on this thing don't sound too much different from what yeh delivered on Pusha T's Daytona there's a similar emphasis on very simple mixes patterns and layering as well as kind of experimental and strange synth sounds and samples and sure while on the surface yeh might seem less experimental than Kanye's oddity opus in 2016 the life of Pablo this is probably the most intimate and unguarded Kanye has been on a record since the college dropout and even though it's not as all-encompassing as jay-z's 444 it's on a similarly personal vibe this thing opens up would be very freaky and intense I thought about killing you which is literally about what the title suggests the track kicks off with these really angelic and subtle background vocal harmonies that are kind of chilling and strange very otherworldly and Kanye isn't rapping at the start of this cut as much as he is just kind of delivering some spoken word talking about killing you talking about killing himself talking about how he sort of struggles with these feelings and this decision despite loving himself and loving you not you you but you know the person he has in mind that person he has in mind being Kanye West himself because of the bipolar angle of the record so at least that's how I'm kind of reading the the lyrics of the song given the mental health angle of the album I'd be lying if I said that I'd never had similarly dark thoughts bitching at the back of my head from time to time and I think that's the case for most people I think but on this track I think Kanye delivers an interesting moment where the audience has to give a bit of pause and kind of reconcile these dark thoughts that they may have in their head from time to time I also love how he kind of portrays these incredibly beautiful thoughts and in love for the people around him those feelings kind of being wrapped in these darker feelings sort of like is his emotions for his family his loved one so on and so forth those sort of inhabit the same dark corners of his mind that some of his worst characteristics come out of deeper into the track he talks about encouraging listeners to speak more freely talking about having to potentially rewrite this song or other songs or other lyrics or whatever just being worried how the audience will take it having to compensate for this fear that the listener will take something that he said very negatively the song eventually starts to build with this very steady kind of melodic flow a freaky beats which up with these horrific blood-curdling screams and really glassy since Kanye rapping about working on a different set of rules being easily provoked it just kind of functions really well as an introduction to this album which i think is just kind of an exploration of a snapshot of Kanye's headspace around this exact point in time the song yikes goes even deeper into Kanye's dark mental state where he is essentially as scary himself and the people around him there's a winning song hook from Kanye a very simple beat but an incredibly killer flow and the lyrics on this thing essentially portray a man who is on the edge high off of his own ego and psychedelic drugs to rapping about praying for Russell Simmons because he got me to that lying on here about saying a of watch he has a hospital band talking about Prince and Michael Jackson trying to warn him maybe it's a spiritual something that's kind of making him see this vision or maybe it's him in the midst of a trip I don't know maybe it's as a result of the kind of mental disorders that he references so boldly on the front cover of this thing either way this track is simultaneously one of Kanye is darkest and catchiest yet the song all mine is the first moment on the album that I think this thing really falters and mostly because the opening guest vocals which are kind of sung in this very childish very silly falsetto are a little off-putting at first the B is a little too minimal the song itself I think is a little too short yeh still sounds like a total monster on the track and sexually sort of seems to laser focus on his addiction to sex and women and while he's definitely hinted toward this very hard on tracks previous this is the first time where I feel like he's he's really portrayed this desire of his as a real dark side of himself as a real addiction something that truly makes him feel almost like sick it's a character flaw I also love the noisy abrasive samples that yeh tosses into the last leg of the track it really kind of brings the song to life gives the track and incredibly experimental edge and to me reads like Kanye just internally screaming through his production I think the record bounces back pretty hard on the song wouldn't leave which is essentially about Kanye dealing with the fallout of his political comments on Twitter having to calm his wife down because you we're gonna lose it all and so on and so forth the song basically turns into a beautiful ode to women who stick by their very broken men and I like the partynextdoor hook on this thing a lot like this track the hook on it the harmonized vocals is a very kind of slick old-school like throwback 80s R&B vibe to it very smooth I would not have pinned this as being partynextdoor singing had I not known also the glamorous keys on this thing are really tasteful these subtle percussion goes over really well and this transitions fantastically into the song no mistakes which essentially continues the narrative of the album Kanye's sort of acknowledging this dark side of himself acknowledging how it's affecting this very important and significant relationship of his if the previous song on this thing is love being questioned then this song is love being affirmed and between Kanye's flow his delivery the instrumental on this thing this is some seriously classic Kanye West like he's really throwing it back on this song to the point where the song sounds almost like a mixtape that came out in the 2000s got a bit of a low fie quality to it that I liked a lot the song ghost town featuring Kid Cudi might in fact be a bit of a teaser toward the kids see ghost collaboration that him in the cud stir have coming out around the corner and it's maybe one of my favorite tracks on this thing it just has a very generous soul sample hanging in the background of course Cudi singing his appearance on the song is a little rough especially when it's kind of region high registered I don't quite know what it is it seemed like he was really holding out of the melody very well in the first leg of that two line bar that he has to sing but then he just sort of drops it I think it really could have been helped with another take but believe it or not this song actually features some of Kanye's best singing in a long time I mean his singing has always been rough and granted it's not perfect here but like he's actually singing pretty well I just love the nostalgic beat the blaring distorted guitar also that weird John Legend intro on this thing seems like he's almost overcome with the emotion of the song his performance the instrumental I'm not really sure but it kind of adds to this feeling that this is like a live recording or some and yet again we get a track that sort of adds to this narrative that Kanye is just simultaneously somebody who is madly in love with his family but also just very disturbed emotionally which I think sort of comes to a head on the zero seven zero shake this is like a new sign II to good music oh I'm not that familiar with yet outside of the contribution that she had made to push a tease recent release but her singing on this track is absolutely chilling at the very end mostly because of her lyrics talking about how she needs to touch a hot stove to see if she still bleeds and there's no feeling and as a result of that she feels free which sort of goes to show how self-destructive somebody can be in their behavior when they feel invincible I see the closing track on here Violent Crimes is almost like the bound to of the album but instead of it being in ode to his love for his wife the relationship he has with her instead it focuses more on his and while Kanye is far and away from the first rapper to have a daughter and then that forces them to rethink their feelings on the fair sex and then they sort of put those emotions into song he certainly puts his own spin on it you could say elements of this track are kind of overprotective even patriarchal but I think Kanye is being more self-aware in this track than a lot of people might give him credit sort of reacting to what he says on this song right away without really diving deeper into his lyrics or his intentions I see the song is just kind of being a very smartly portrayed struggle internal struggle that Kanye is going to have with these feelings of having a daughter also the gorgeous lavish vocal harmonies on this thing sound great the chord progression is chilling and has a bit of a gospel vibe to it and all in all I just think it's a great ending to this very short release I mean even though yae seems like a pretty unorthodox release for yay I for the most part loved it I think it paints a really smart and vivid picture of his current state of self of his family ties and also his mental health but also I think this is going to be an album where two different camps of yay fans kind of split people who are fans of yay the person yay the artist are really going to enjoy what he delivers on this record but people who are more into his music for the image that he puts up in it for the illusions of grandeur that he delivers you are most likely going to be underwhelmed and sorely disappointed because on this album Kanye doesn't really try to be anything else other than the very broken troubled and conflicted person that he is simply titling this album yeah is incredibly fitting because listening to this feels like you're getting so close to the artist that it almost becomes awkward again depending on how you interpret this and whether or not you like the direction this is going in but if I haven't made this clear enough already I do I I do enjoy this direction of course there are a few moments where I think the rough production and very lightning in a bottle songwriting does kind of kneecap the full potential of a few tracks here and there are other spots on the album where I wish songs were longer or I just wish this overall were longer it almost seems like an injustice for an album tackling the very lofty and dense topics that this album is to just be twenty four minutes in length though I will say I do think it has a hell of a job of that and and actually sequences the songs very well so there's kind of a logical progression and flow to a lot of what Kanye is saying I also want to praise Kanye's lyricism on this thing sure he has his usual very tongue-in-cheek and playful and silly double entendre zand and word plays a few of my favorites being that nobody would be here without come line and also a that sentimental sent to mental bar was amazing but yeah biggest complaint about this thing is really that I just wanted more out of it I would love to hear more I would love to hear more but that being said highly impressed with the seven tracks that are on here to begin with so I'm feeling a decent - strong 8 on this thing transition did you give this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next

great producer who has produced a couple of songs for your boy couch' chest oh you guys remember from his recent singles he did that Coinstar track he did The Slap Chop track and he's got a whole little like mini album here of electronic music wonky stuff so if you're into that sort of thing dig on this give it a shot link down there below alright let's get into the worst tracks let's get into the worst tracks uh new lily allen song over here which I'm not that into unfortunately it's it's easily one of the most vapid songs I've heard her release in a while it's titled lost my mind and it sort of sounds like it I got I'm not really looking forward to this this new record of hers all the songs leading up to it just don't really have that much in the way of any flavor there's not really a whole lot of excitement just kind of at a loss moving on from there Gorillaz saw fit to drop a couple of new tracks this week this upcoming record doesn't seem to be as like massive I guess an experience as humans might have been briefer tracklist doesn't have quite as dense a feature list either so maybe that's sort of a step in the right direction in the bigger picture you know in the grander scheme of things because humans was kind of bogged down with features and I just sort of lost a sense of her lost sight of what exactly Gorillaz is on that record you know that there's there's certainly no distracting guests on this new song over here to kind of take away from the core of the band I mean there's kind of a silly celebrity-packed music video that's attached to the song that I'm talking about here humility but I got to say I don't really care for the super carefree sunny kind of tropical beach pop that Damon Albarn is creating under the gorillas name with this this new track over here honestly there's another song that they dropped this week I'll talk about it later in this video because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit more oh and there's also this new 1975 track give yourself a try this is awful like not only is it one of their whiniest songs it has a terrible music video and it sounds like a really crappy 2000s era emo band trying to rip off Joy Division please spare me do not do this I have no have no interests in this whatsoever bye-bye let's move on to the mass section tracks that I didn't think we're terrible but certainly we're worth mentioning kind of pointing out pointing in your direction because there's some good stuff going on the Internet again come over now keep in mind I was never a really big fan of the Internet but their latest singles have been pretty groovy enjoyably groovy and I'm really excited about that again the vocals are a little underwhelming but hey you know if the songwriting and the instrumentals and the grooves are there the baselines are great I could see myself warming up to what the internet is doing so you know if you love some soul if you love some neo soul you love some funk you love some R&B you love some some some nice catchy funky pop music that's a little easygoing kind of soft on the ears give this a new single and the internet a shot the track is titled to come over moving on from there I believe this is the new suicide year song yes this is a new suicide year track I was digging on spider feet featuring yung lean kind of a dark quirky trap banger young leans vocals are a little monotone kind of dejected as usual it's it's not a bad track it's not blowing me away or anything but it's not bad night jewel has a new single out the tracks on the Ehsan b-side are on your own and the joke's on you bit of a I guess 80s new wave throwback definitely clearer and less dreamy than a lot of the songs I'm used to hearing from the night jewel name not exactly the most original thing I've heard in this style but the songwriting is not bad you know it's a compelling couple of tunes Mac Miller dropped a handful of tracks this week smallworlds buttons and programs programs was easily my favorite of the bunch I would actually probably throw programs into the best tracks of the week section that had by far some of the most animated flows and vocal delivery the quirkiest production and the bunch of tracks that got dropped the other two songs are pretty laid-back kind of eclectic kind of stoner jazz rap kind of trippy sort of thing it didn't blow me away or anything but um you know we're certainly a nice listen I'd be down to listening to a record if Mac sort of dropped an entire release of stuff like this so Mac Miller uh just waiting for a new record around the corner I guess certainly a nicer change of pace than a the last record he dropped where he was like trying to sing on every track and it just didn't really do too much for me because I don't get a whole lot out of his out of his singing voice but when it comes to his rapping and the sort of left field production that usually brings on to a track I'm definitely definitely there for that I'm present I am present moving on from there idols the UK art Punk and post-punk outfit dropped a new single this week titled colossus new album on the way it's uh it's kind of a slow burner it really is a slow burner I don't know how crazy I am about it honestly yeah after a while I just kind of felt like it was just going on too long I was kind of waiting for the payoff I mean it was certainly menacing for quite a bit of the runtime of the song but it's it's definitely one of the longer and in slog year songs the band has ever come out with and you know I guess maybe there just weren't enough layers or enough I don't know lyrical tie-ins for me to really kind of be on the edge of my seat throughout the whole thing but hey you know it's it might be a track that grows on me as I hear the album more but it is an odd promotional cut because it is a very patience testing and very girthy very girthy song moving on from there gorillas the second track that they dropped this week this one Lake Zurich is mostly an instrumental cut kind of a blend of the quirky electronic pop and synth funk well quirky electronic pop that we expect from gorillas but synth funk is mixed in there too and it's a actually really cool fun blend it's it's not entirely instrumental it's mostly instrumentals kind of like a synth funk Odyssey in a way kind of futuristic but kind of a throwback as well but I dig it quite a bit I mean as of right now in regards to this new gorillaz record it could go either way you know I'm anticipating it's going to be better than humans I mean I don't see how it couldn't be unless they really just totally throw caution to the wind in every way shape and form and it's just a total mess but honestly I still have hope I still have hope all right moving on from there this new Charli XCX track 5:00 in the morning 5:00 a.m. yeah it's it's it's okay you know it's it's not quite as experimental or as odd as some of the material that she's been dropping lately especially on a number one angel and pop to kind of a straightforward trap banger but with a few weird PC music ish qualities coming out of the instrumental again one of her least freaky singles in a while but still a decent listen still a decent listen the vocals aren't really that strange either on this cut you know it just seems like she kind of dialed it back a little bit consciously for a track that might have a bit of a wider appeal I don't know and let's go into the best tracks best tracks best tracks we actually have quite a few best tracks this week a lot of songs dropped this week and a lot of really good ones too some of which I'm not gonna be able to get too much into because I'm gonna be reviewing the albums that they are off of but let's get into it first new kpop quartet who are actually connected to a another group out there who goes by the name of Luna I believe this group yxy this they have a song called love forever and it features grimes and it's it's quite the k-pop banger some really beautiful ascending lead vocals a really bright hard-hitting instrumental very fun track very catchy very sweet very lovable moving on from there we xur finally covered Toto's Africa as I guess has become a little bit of a meme and the Weezer community so I guess now it's finally here and it's a I mean it sounds pretty good it sounds fun although it sounds in a lot of ways identical to the original track you know what one of the only differentiating factors is just kind of that blaring heavy Weezer Weezer ish you know guitar tone that you typically hear in their songs you know and and that of course that of course in rivers vocals are pretty distinct moving on from there my boy Tony Malina has a new song now called nothing I can say new record on the way kill the lights and it's just kind of a one-minute kind of sad boy underground lo-fi punk ish ballad and that's that's kind of what Tony Malina does he just writes super short songs and I'm kind of looking forward to this new record of his because this track sounded pretty ambitious pretty well assembled and very dense instrumentally just looking forward to seeing how all of these songs tie together I kind of really liked a lot his distant dismissed record which is like this 11 minute breakup album and I don't know just every once in a while I put that thing on and I listened to it three times all the way through and it's it's just it's just a good time just a good time for me so I just want to hear more sad short songs from my boy Tony Malina moving on from there st. Vincent has an alternate version of the song slow disco from her latest record and this one is fast slow disco so it actually is what it describes and it actually makes the track much more engaging than it was on the the original record so pretty interesting take pretty interesting a version of the song it's it's rare that you have an artist sort of put out their own remix of a track you know and and I mean in the sense of like oh you got a feature on it or whatever you know what I mean like she literally kind of remixed and reoriented and re temp ode in the the entire song and it's actually pretty cool that she kind of changed things up a little bit all right my girl Rosa Lea she came back with a brand new single you guys if you have not heard last year's los angeles that is one of my favorite records of the year and it's a beautiful album and Rosalia on this new song over here is not only showing that she's a versatile artist because this is not in the same Spanish folk and flamenco tradition that that album was this is a straight up pop song of course there are a lot of Foulke and Spanish elements that sort of come up in the music on this but but this is this is straight-up pop tune this is a straight up pop tune manaman and it's so goddamn sexy and moody and fun and catchy and I don't know I'm just really happy that she was able to kind of pull a track like this off it goes over well and in the short amount of time that this song has been up this thing has already amassed two point two million views on YouTube so huge song for Rosa Lee a huge song for her and you know I think a important moment for Spanish music when it comes to the you know more underground stuff of course the there are a lot of huge crossover hits an artists getting into the mainstream right now I feel like we're in the midst of potentially another Latin explosion but I think with the internet that's probably gonna come and stay because now with the internet kind of you can create a community and a niche around anything and as long as you keep beating that niche like the the demand for the type of music that that niche desires it's not gonna go anywhere it's not like you have the labels kind of killing and throwing out and deciding what records are coming in and going based merely on whether or not a certain hype cycle for a particular sound or genre or trend is is that its peak and oh no it's going away ah right get rid of it now I think stuff like this and stuff like I know the new J Balvin album just came out as well a lot of people haven't asked me about that I think stuff like that it's it's here and it's here to stay and as long as the the material that's coming out is as quality as this track is as fun and and again kind of a very uh there's there's I mean of course the Spain is a European country but there's something that are so cool and calm and collected and just just European about this true that that I like quite a bit I don't know I'm just loving the song I can't say enough nice things about it alright moving on from there this is a new track from one pen gut has a new record coming out I believe on terrible records this song is titled independent this guy is a solo artist he kind of mixes together an element of like art pop and hip hop and electronic music - it's a really interesting song and I mean I can't tell you what all the lyrics on the track mean but it's a really eclectic track and I don't know the first time I guess a Norwegian rapping has really kind of kept me on the edge of my seat so I guess there is that of course people will flood the comments of being like hey hey I know 50 Norwegian rappers who were amazing and hey you know listen I'm sure they're all good okay I'm sure I'm sure they're great I'm sure they're all better than Eminem okay but the thing is this is the first time I'm hearing some of it and it's kind of like wow it's it's really gripping me and it's not just because of you know the fact that it's Norwegian of course like his flow is really compelling and I think the instrumental is like really eclectic and weird so I really kind of digging this quite a bit moving on from there I'm digging this new track from lump which I want to turn you guys onto loops excuse me I'm digging this new lump track although I'm not gonna say too much about it because I do want to review the the new record this week at some point if you don't know lump is this new musical project featuring singer-songwriter Laura Marling and one of the dudes from that experimental Fulk outfit tongue and I'm really kind of liking the sounds that they're drumming up this song over here is titled maybe I be the light give it a shot it's really good this is the forthcoming record from a band that I it's been years since I've reviewed their stuff and they're they're kind of a blend of jazz progressive rock a sort of obscure prog rock offshoot called Zul and the band features drummer Tatsuya Yoshida of the band ruins and he's appeared in and collaborated with other groups as well but that's primarily the group that I know him from because they're an experimental kind of progressive noise free improv avant rock bass and drum duo that makes some really incredible and intense music however this over here is a totally different band that goes by the name of koenji Hayek II if you guys go back into my video catalog I reviewed their last full length record which I thought was pretty good this new song over here and I believe it's one song it's like this 11 minute experimental prog jazz monster which I'm gonna butcher the pronunciation of this but Jory Doran vish this digest door door and visca digest I believe that's how you say it but yeah it's an incredible like amazing epic prog jazz experimental rock insane like banger we called a banger odyssey it's really more of an odyssey that it's it's just pure orgasmic prog bliss so give it a shot it's actually pretty incredible and electrifying I think you're gonna have a lot of fun with it if this is sort of your thing moving on from there pink champagne which is the latest single from the band kitten kit in the band another kind of 80s pop rock new wave ish throwback with a lot of passion a lot of fire coming out of the vocals very amped and a very electrifying performance again nothing too original or like reinventing the wheel which is something I I sort of brought up with their last big single that I talked about in a in the worst best tracks segment but still an incredibly catchy and fun and passionate song moving on from there whoo my dude Kumasi Washington Street Fighter mas new song new new single new release from his forthcoming two-and-a-half hour album which has a really weird kind of very almost brutal just a very gurgly steady bass line which is kind of a little unlike a Kumasi Washington song usually the bass is a bit more dynamic but I feel like he almost had like a bit of a synth funk in tension with the rhythm section on this track a little bit of course he builds on top of that with his typical typically epic and heavy and very dense vocals and strings and so on and so forth it's it's a really I guess uh beautiful multi-phased and very intense experimental jazz and sort of forward-thinking cutting edge listen so definitely give it a shot and I think we have a few more here this new track Maru or not Maru I'm an idiot Haru this is a solo j-pop artist and this song I'm going to butcher the pronunciation pronunciation of as well you may woo me me you I believe is how you say it this is a project this is a record I'm still kind of getting acclimated to and I'm looking forward to kind of doing a review of this record when I get a chance I'm not going to say too much more about it now give this thing a shot if you're into experimental j-pop with some subtle like and strange rock influences worked and give it a shot father John misty new song out which I'm not going to talk too much about because I'm reviewing the album this week so look out for that and that my friends has been the weekly track roundup okay thank you for listening thank you for watching again shout out to our sponsor over here rich wallets rich wallet dot-com slash Fantan oh that link is down there below and yeah along with all of the songs that I just talked about right here in this video so alright you're the best love you love you love you forever 
GO_hwQqCDZo,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new Nicki mini-album Zephyr this is the debut mini-album of singer-songwriter recent 88 rising signing Nicki aka Nicole's afonya it is a short 25 minutes and 8 tracks but a very promising start to a hopefully successful career in pop and R&B even though Zephyr is of a meagre size it is still a project that showcases some thoughtful songwriting quality vocals tasteful production a very sensual vibe as well as a mix of classic and contemporary R&B sounds the song news flash is an excellent start to the record kind of feels like instrumentally a mix of Amy Winehouse some Norah Jones with lots of rich pianos and very crisp sequence drums vintage horn hits sassy lead vocals delivering lyrics about shutting down this guy who she sees as kind of being out of her league not to mention in her description he seems like a little bit of a d-bag kind of like a pickup artist type even though Nicki feels like an artist who kind of wears her influences on her sleeve from the start of this project she still has quite a bit of personality on this cut not only through the singing and lead vocals but with some of the more playful and ad-lib e vocal bits that pop up here and there the transition the song from one section to another also that hook like when the horns burst in and go be someone else's it's just an impeccable start to this thing a great introduction to a new artist overall if you only listen to one single song off of this project make sure it's this one Nicki then takes things into slightly more sensual territory with say my name sonically while it is one of the softer tracks on this thing its intentions are some of the most animalistic with Nicki going as far as to tell her man on the track to shut the fuck up and close the tour there's a real element of tension and lyrics on this track like her and this guy just kind of got through arguing but she kind of wants to get back to that moment where their relationship is in a state of bliss strictly in the physical sense in in this instance it's not a bad tune either though I will say the production on this cut is a little bit more contemporary and a tad bland these song friends seems almost like a track that's stereotypically I would hear like a Kalani or asses on top of basically singing about making this mistake of getting to physical or to intimate with a guy and now you sort of regret it and wish you would just remain friends the hook pops but I wish it lasted just a little bit longer while the verses kind of feel like these musical internal ramblings of all the downsides of this decision that she's made and even though the subject matter of this track is pretty awkward it's undeniably one of the cuter songs on the entire project then there is the very dramatic and spacious spells which feels like a euphoric dream their distant shimmering pianos on this thing and gellick background vocals this very subtle puttering track beat which I wasn't all that crazy about at first but it has kind of warmed up to me it doesn't really overtake the song that much Nicki not only wins me over with some of the lyrical bright spots on this track like even though this person doesn't believe in heaven she's going to love them till it hurts like hell but also she delivers what's easily one of the most emotional vocal performances on the entire project - between the good song and the beautiful vocals and the instrumentation on this track it feels almost unfair to critique or review it because I'm really just being seduced on this song I'm kind of powerless against it the moment when she's singing about God breaking this spell certainly seems apt given that the song feels like a lovesick trance the song vintage feels like an old-school 90s era pop and R&B blend with this bustling be bright ringing synth chords very nimble vocal leads and harmonies I don't know if it's the tune or the chords or the beat but there's just something about the song that feels eerily similar to that ghost town DJ's song my boo meanwhile the lyrics tell this story of falling back in love with someone who you used to be in a relationship with so that relationship that connection it's it's vintage and even though you had this falling out you kind of forget why the relationship ended and getting back together with that person feels kind of easy it's sort of like familiar territory it's after this track though or I feel like the the mini record here starts to falter a bit the song dancing with the devil doesn't have the sharpest tune on the record though I will admit it is a high point on the album when Nicki busts out with that God I'm so gone line the song pools is yet another very Spacey glassy ballad I feel like she did this aesthetic better on spell though not only that but the track seems to have like a similar descending vocal melody that just has too many eerie similarities to it just kind of feels like a redundant moment in the tracklisting overall and the very somber and simple vocal piano combo at the very finish of this thing shows that Nicky works pretty well in an intimate context as well even though I wouldn't say this record sticks to the landing I still think it's a relatively solid effort and even though it's not exactly cutting edge when it comes to the genres the Nicky's playing and there are still a lot of great performances and good singing and quality writing and classy instrumentation on this thing it seems like Nicky has a lot going for her right out of the gate I'm feeling a light 7 on this thing transition have you given this thing listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should our view next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantan Oh Nicky Zephyr forever 
1C33F3MAGuU,hi everyone when Nene went Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ASAP Rocky album testing Harlem rapper and ASAP mob figurehead ASAP Rocky is back with his third full-length commercial album since breaking out in 2011 with his pretty incredible live love ASAP mixtape a psychedelic cutting-edge and one-of-a-kind project that I still enjoy quite a bit to this day following this mixtape ASAP rocky had a successful debut record hit songs a growing profile a gigantic major label record deal it looked like there was really no place to go but up for rocky and the rest of the mob in the first half of this decade anyway since 2015 though the potential that ASAP rocky showed has been continually squandered with a painfully mediocre and bloated follow-up album at long last ASAP a record that embraced Rocky's cloud rap origins but somehow failed to carry over the catchy songwriting and slick flows and lyricism that also made him as popular as he is not to mention the consistently embarrassing group releases the ASAP mob have dropped again and again and again or the mobs inability for any single member to grab the spotlight consistently in the same way that rocky has it's kind of nice the group brought playboy cardi into the fold around 2016 certainly shows they're not down and out and they're still looking forward but most of the time I just kind of see cardi is someone who's doing his own thing now while testing is not the continually flavorless and washed out slog that at long last ASAP was it somehow sounds just as lost in the woods I mean certainly this record is an extension of that whole cloud rap sound and vibe and aesthetic that ASAP Rocky is known for but rarely are the sounds on this album actually euphoric or blissful or overwhelming or intoxicating in the way that great music in this genre should be mostly a lot of the strange samples and psychedelic effects and random ad-libs and vocal snippets come off kind of sloppy or unkempt especially since the songwriting on this thing is generally lackluster and doesn't really have a whole lot of structure to it on top of that Rocky's voice feels mostly buried in a lot of the chaos on these songs the delay is the Reve Erbs the strange effects and samples it's like he's working with his producers to just pack as much as he possibly can into nearly every track here because he knows his lyrics he knows his flows are not going to steal the spotlight because his style his delivery really has anything hasn't changed all that much in the past seven years in fact I would say rocky sounds less enthusiastic now than he's ever been when this record is at its best rocky picks a hard-hitting or quirky or just kind of trippy or psychedelic piece of production drops a catchy flow has some kind of semblance of a hook praise de Lord is an excellent example of this the song features the sharp little harmonized flute leads bumping bass a crucial skepta feature Rocky's opening verse on this one is one of the most braggadocious and slick on the entire album then we have the strangely glassy and surreal buckshot which features these icy synthesizers these really engaging beat drops and effects some rattling trap hi-hats as well and it's one of the few moments on the album where all of these hallucinogenic implications in the production actually add up into an enjoyable experience it doesn't just feel like an overwrought distraction from a clear lack of a song idea the song OG beeper is pretty hot as well features a strange and very eerie synth line very prominent block boy jb ad-libs a very minimal beat I think this track overall is kind of a display of the power of simplicity although there is kind of an eyebrow raising reference to six 9s gumbo flow in in the latter points of the song which I'm not exactly sure is is this a tribute to him is this a shot at him I'm not really sure it's about as head-scratching as the abrupt ending on this song because I mean it really is one of the better tracks on here I don't know why it couldn't have had a proper finish so what else can I praise on here Frank ocean's appearance on purity is absolutely amazing really a high point on the entire album I also loved all the twisted and pitched vocal harmonies and layers throughout this track kind of sounds like something off of a James Blake song and Rocky's finishing verse on this track is actually one of the more heartfelt on the entire record to the Kid Cudi feature on this album is tolerable but outside of that I'm just not sure what to say most of the tracks on this thing are either an utter mess or just severely underwhelmed the song ASAP forever lives up to its title in that it literally feels like it's going on forever what makes this song appealing is it the boring shimmery Mobe sample whose source material is needlessly rehashed at the very end of the song like we we know where the chords came from they sound mostly undoctored we didn't really need to hear it in its full form at the finish of the track is it the really drab and flat beat that barely has a groove to it is it Rockies unenthusiastic delivery this is easily one of the most uninteresting singles you've ever dropped the instrumental on Tony tone sounds pretty slick there are some cool and very deep musical references that rocky peppers throughout his verses but his delivery just sounds kind of jaded and I'm not really sure what the appeal of the interupting ad-libs and vocal snippets on this track are either and while rocky insists that he doesn't give a fuck about a list there's another spot on the album where he says that if he's gonna be in your top 10 he better be number one if the song fucks sleep is an indication of anything it's that you really do need sleep you should get some sleep because you literally sound half asleep on the track maybe that was conceptual or intentional in some kind of way but it hasn't really helped the appeal or the entertainment value of the song and fka twigs while I love her I think her music is great I don't mind her vocal performance here the song is really just too much of a mess for her to save it or add to it in any way artistically that's going to improve it overall I really got to give it to RCA Records for letting a total mess like call drops slip on to this album I guess the label is a really Pro artistic freedom if something like this can land on testing the track features this jangly guitar sample that sounds kind of leaned out ASAP Rocky's drop tops vocal melody sounds like a subconscious interpolation of the background vocals on that Flamengo song I only have eyes for you and the song is mostly just ASAP Rocky singing in a comatose fashion over these very dreamy guitars with Kodak black later on the track providing a feature over the phone from prison in concept I feel like this track should be one of the most experimental and interesting of ASAP Rocky's career the Spacey instrumental the heavy use of guitar the psychedelic effect even Dean Blunt is on this track of all people the kodak black phone appearance on paper all of it sounds really cool but in practice it's just slop the song brother man is a much smarter and much more tasteful infusion of hip-hop and soul with a lot of very jazzy dynamic backing instrumentation dreamy strings and pianos really rich backing vocals it's a super engaging and sweet moment on the album but the insistence on having to fight for something or stand for something in the messaging of the song just kind of disconnects for me because ASAP Rocky doesn't really stand for that much in the lyrics or that much in his music in general even though the track sounds cool at the end of the day it just kind of feels like an empty platitude or a hollow promise there are more work guitars trap beats and awful singing on the song kids turned out fine on the song changes ASAP rocky essentially sounds like an emotionally crushed hobo Johnson nabbing the andre 3000 international players anthem flow to rap about a girl who left him and essentially how exes and friends of his are kind of moving on and getting hitched and living adult lives the track makes numerous weird transitions from ghostly vocal samples to bad auto-tuned singing passages a totally unexpected beast switch with some pretty subpar rap verses then coming back to the original sound of the song with ASAP kind of admitting he has a hard time focusing then he's rapping about what being like a mix of Biggie and Tupac like no no please stop stop this stop look I think there are some interesting ideas on this album here and there the issue is is that they are not performed or organized all that well a great deal of the time ASAP Rocky is an awful singer and he's barely holding it together as a rapper these days the songs on this thing have no flow and just feel cobbled together sure while some moments here might seem kind of experimental and ASAP Rocky is just kind of throwing everything in but the kitchen sink there's not really a strong sense of direction overall on this record nor does this thing really feel like an example of ASAP Rocky doing what he does best or at least I don't know try to top himself or improve or I'm feeling us strong for to a light five

KmLvOn-f5Oo,"*Sigh* Hi, everyone MOVETHONY ONTANO here, the Internet's busiest music nerd, and it's time for review of the brand-new BTS album: Love yourself: Tear. This is the latest full-length album from the k-pop phenom known as BTS the ""bulletproof boy scouts"" themselves. It's their sixth full-length studio album with each new release growing their profile over here in the States and beyond. One of their biggest releases so far being their EP mini-album that dropped at some point last year ""Love Yourself: Her"" which featured smash hits on is such as ""Mic Drop"" a track I liked quite a bit It's a pop rap banger of sorts as many BTS tracks are. The thing is it's kind of hard to stylistically pigeonhole the group even though they are umbrella termed as ""K-pop"" Because once you go into a BTS album you can expect not only to hear hip-hop elements and electronic music elements but pop of many different shades Something that unquestionably makes the group stand out but simultaneously kills the consistency factor of their previous releases. But Love Yourself is a little different in that it's kind of a conceptual release as was its predecessor Love Yourself: Her I wouldn't say this album is as much as
sequel as it is a mirror image of sorts. With Love Yourself: Her featuring much brighter and lovesick tunes, whereas Tear over here sees the group exploring more moody and heartbroken territory for like 11 tracks in 40 or so minutes And the record actually has a pretty decent start
with the song ""Singularity"" It's a super sensual introduction and sounds very much like a slow emotional 90s R&B throwback. With super minimal percussion bass and piano.
Very minimal However, each of these bits of instrumentation make incredibly tasteful embellishments once you hit certain points in the song
certain bits of the progression. ♫ Buh-do-do-do-dooooooo ♫ The bass and piano essentially just feel like they're caught in this incredibly graceful dance with the vocals. Which, I might add, are very well performed. At this point I should point out that
South Korea has a very long-standing tradition of making very sad, and forlorn, and dramatic,
and passionate soul and R&B music. And even though BTS are categorized
strictly as a K-pop group, this song, and a few others on this record as well, 
feel like a very conscious nod to that tradition The song Fake Love, the biggest hit on this album feels like an ultra poppy rap
blend with a potently emotional edge The lyrics on this thing feel a lot like they're just kind of about being untrue
about a relationship that you're in. Pretending to be happy even though
you're sad in the relationship. Pretending to be strong even though
you're hurt in the relationship. I guess just falsifying your emotions in the relationship. It's slightly obnoxious and kind of glitzy and feels a little bit like a bastardization of all the stylistic parties involved. But the song is still delivered with a lot of heart. And I can't deny how enjoyably slick
the production on this thing is. Nor how meticulously the song has been assembled ♫ Fake love ♫ ♫ Fake love ♫ Truth be told pop comes down to a lot of formulas
and if that is in fact the case BTS has really kind of perfected what they're doing here The song The Truth Untold feels like another nod
to the world of South Korean soul and R&B It's a very slow, very spacey, powerful piano ballad and emotional showstopper
where the vocals really steal the spotlight The lyrics on this thing are pretty much the groups of usual mix of Korean and English With a lot of references to, I think, wanting the other person or wanting the relationship with this person But not being able to give yourself to them
or to the relationship I mean Even though I'm hitting kind of a personal language barrier here with this track and others on this record as well The pianos and the vocals come together
and just create a passion powerhouse that they give me all whipped up The following fourth track on here is a
very tasteful piece of tropical jazz rap With fun woodwinds and flavorful guitars
really crisp drums, very close claustrophobic sensual rapping The group transitions really well into
a soaring hook on this cut, too Which is an issue that I had previous
with some of BTS's work Where continually the group would
deliver these hyper-aggressive verses Whether it be kind of a pop or rap blend And then suddenly transition breakneck style into these soaring, glamorous choruses That just kind of felt disconnected from
the rest of the track stylistically But again this track over here by comparison feels so much more logical and consistent After this though, I feel like is when
the tracklist starts to fall apart a bit and kind of lose its own sense of identity and concept The track Paradise
It's a decent pop song It's kind of bland but doesn't really feel
all that strongly adhered to the mood that the record had been delivering so far The song Love Maze feels like a bit of a return to that and it's infinitely a better song
more fleshed out structure and stylistically kind of feels like a throwback to a piece of American 2000s dance pop with bumping bass,
tight percussion jangling rhythm guitars
and orgasmic falsetto on the hook A lot of quality rap flows and the lyrics on this track essentially being about The difficult decisions and directions that one might need to find themselves choosing when in the midst of of love or the love maze Now if just a track ago,
the album was hitting a bit of turbulence I feel like after this is when things
kind of take a bit of a nosedive The song Magic Shop is easily one of the worst
on the entire record The song features these EDM style chords and beats rushing in underneath one of the most garish and grossly melodramatic
hooks on the entire record *magic shooooop* The track Airplane pt.2 is a sequel to a track that landed on the recent release
from member J-Hope on a solo effort And even though it's not one of the worst songs on here There's certainly some flavorful
instrumentation on this thing Overall it just sounds like the group trying to capitalize on the recent Latin pop trend in a somewhat awkward way The group continues their tropical instrumental streak on the next Anpanman With a kooky banger beat
kind of a tedious redundant hook ♫ Turn it up. Turn it up ♫ However, I do love the groove and I kind of give the cut points for having a very unique subject matter As this song is pretty much a reference to the Japanese picture book, an anime series of the same title Essentially a show conceived by Takashi Yanase about a superhero who doled out these Japanese sweet breads Whose conception was rooted in the starvation that a lot of Japanese faced during the Second World War The song So What is yet another low point on the album For me it just kind of features a lot of very speedy
faux macho rapping over a lot of EDM style beats Which is not really something I'm interested in hearing whether it's an American group whether it's a foreign group It's really just not my style.
I just find it really... Overblown
So formulaic it's just a turn-off. Just kind of your typical mash of EDM and pop. However, Love Yourself: Tear does end pretty strong
with the outro on this thing which is a kind of emo trap banger Yes, this thing has a hard, crispy trap beat
with strings on strings on strings And a series of fiery rap verses that
simultaneously sound hard But also like each member of the group is on the verge of an emotional breakdown Especially J-Hope during his final verse of this thing
who just sounds like a total mess And even reading into the translation I mean, some of what he says is actually quite poetic So even though you could argue
yeah sure, you know, love is a pretty cliché song topic subject matter At least it seems like BTS is giving it their all and approaching it. Overall, even though this album wasn't a perfect record I still pretty much liked it It's the kind of futuristic but studied, versatile,
but widely appealing pop music that I wish we were making over here
right now in the mainstream Instead we're suffering through
nostalgia like Charlie Puth Justin Timberlake's country phase and Taylor Swift trying to go dark and edgy While Love Yourself: Tear
does have its consistency issues It's K-pop It's about as commercial and it's premeditated as mainstream music gets So while it kind of sucks they didn't really stick to their intended concept I guess I'm not all that surprised Because at the end of the day a group like this is most likely going to focus on just trying to have a little bit of something for everybody on a record as opposed to bogging it down in concept. However, I think this album BTS and their success are a big sign
that Western artists need to start paying attention to A sign that South Korea is providing
real competition in the music industry I mean
I don't know what the future holds but for now BTS is delivering some incredibly slick music with tasteful instrumentation
infectious hooks and passionate vocal performances too Sure, a few of the Instrumentals on this thing
are kind of tacky and the group didn't really follow through
that much with their concept But those aren't even issues that some of BTS is Western contemporaries try to avoid I guess the point that I'm making here is
groups like BTS, these k-pop groups are making pop music that's just as good as pop music over here if not better And hopefully going forward they continue to win over more listeners hone their craft and maybe make records like this
a bit more consistently enjoyable I'm feeling a decent to strong 6 on this thing. Tran-sition Have you given this record to listen, did you love it? Did you hate it? What would you rate it? You're the best. You're the best. What should I review next? it's like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry leave a Leave a comment in the comments if you're feeling full of thoughts Click on the link next to my head to hit up another video or the link to subscribe to the channel hit the bell as well BTS. Love Yourself.
