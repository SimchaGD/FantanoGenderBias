u37lG0BMFZk,"Ahhh, Ahhh Hi everyone, Longthony Waittano here, the internet's busiest music nerd. And it's time for a review of the new Tyler, the Creator Album, IGOR. This is the sixth full-length album from one of the most polarizing and uncompromising rappers and producers of this generation, Tyler, the Creator. It has been a few years now since the release of Tyler's most critically-acclaimed album yet, Flower Boy. Which was a pretty amazing moment for him in his discography. Easily his most consistent record yet in-terms of style and quality. Better production and lyrics on this thing, quality features as-well as smooth fusions of hip-hop and soul throughout almost every instrumental here. Not only was Tyler writing some of his best songs to date on this album, but a lot of the amateurish and childishly edgy characteristics of his past works that really held his music back, kind of melted away. It's like a switch was flipped and we were being presented with an all-new Tyler here. And IGOR presents us with a brand-new Tyler, the Creator as-well Like a few of Tyler's previous projects IGOR sees our hip-hop anti-hero embracing a new character and a new narrative. IGOR is more than just another persona though, it's also a vehicle for Tyler to express his heartbreak and explore more singing and tuneful song-writing. Flower Boy definitely saw Tyler gravitating more towards these sounds and maybe with his next record some of his long-time fans were hoping that he would come through with an album that was more of a true-blue hip-hop experience. But, IGOR is not that. The instrumentals on this record embrace even more soul, even more R&B. And, not to say that aren't points on this album where Tyler raps, there are. He even makes sure to work a few bangers into the mix like NEW MAGIC WAND as-well as WHAT'S GOOD, but these cuts are more the exception than the rule. Again most of the tracks on this album fit into more of a soul categorization. With some of the instrumentation on them throwing it back the '60s and '70s. Such as A BOY IS A GUN and ARE WE STILL FRIENDS as-well as EARFQUAKE to a degree. And, it's a weird vibe. Tyler's embrace of these sounds, feels like a combination of several different things. The tone of the instrumentation, the kind of messy production and the singing on here leaves me feeling like I'm hearing Tyler be a little tongue-in-cheek. But given the narrative of these tracks it does feel like he's trying to express some genuine feelings here. The textures and timbres in the instrumentation are great too, but it is a decidedly rough presentation. A little lo-fi in the same way Cherry Bomb was. Some of the mixes are kind of funny. But even though some of Tyler's lack-luster production in the past has rubbed me the wrong way. With IGOR it feels like it's coming from a place of skill. Essentially, it's the difference between making a sub-par recording because you can't make anything else other than a sub-par recording and going back to embrace and more flawed and gruff, raw aesthetic once you have gained the ability to make something as clean and as well crafted as Flower Boy. It's almost post-punk in a way, Tyler's ability to subvert and mutate the smooth, jazzy and sweet sounds of Soul and R&B throughout multiple tracks on this album. It's also worth mentioning that it is painfully obvious that the work of Pharell has been hugely influential to the instrumental front of this record too. Which given Tyler's history should no surprise. He has been and unapologetic fan of Williams for a long-time. But never before in my opinion has he embraced so many obvious Pharell-isms in his music this hard, but also kind of made them his-own. The world that Tyler presents on IGOR, and I do think it is a world, is vivid, it's seamless, it is immersive. While I'm mentioning influences in this review, I should also name-drop rapper, producer, legend Madlib too. Not only because of the artfully rough production and vintage samples placed throughout this album, but also the pitched vocals and character development that Tyler engages in on IGOR also reminds me of some of Madlib's Quasimoto efforts. As far as the run-time goes IGOR also has an impeccable flow. There is really no excuse to leave until the last track is over, even if the narrative of the album doesn't follow the most obvious progression. On IGOR's earliest moments we already see the relationship that the album is based-on in a moment of crisis, with Tyler begging his romantic-interest here not to leave. And, as the album progresses we get different flavours of romantic-toxicity, illustrating exactly why this relationship is crumbling in the first-place. Things essentially reach a dead-end with the revelation of I DON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE. We also have a moment of finality after that with ARE WE STILL FRIENDS. Like volatile relationships themselves, the album is kind of like being stuck in the middle of a continuous tumble-cycle. And, when it's over you are busy to decipher exactly what happened, who's at fault and how you can prevent it from happening again. IGOR is an album that leaves the listener with in my opinion quite a few loose-ends and unresolved feelings, but it's still a very satisfying and cathartic project. The song EARFQUAKE is kind of mellow and maybe even a little funny at first glance, but with more listens it becomes clear that Tyler is actually pouring his heart into these squeaky weird lead vocals. The heartbreak coming off the lyrics is tangible even if there is a supremely large element of camp to what Tyler is doing here. ♪ When it all comes crashing down I'll need you ♪ There's also a Playboi Carti feature on this track that is placed perfectly. His weird baby-voiced verse fits the aesthetic of the song quite well and he is one of many very fantastic and impressive guests on this record. Many of which are a little obscured and kind of buried in the mixes of particular tracks, I mean they certainly add to the character and flavour of this album, but there aren't a whole lot of features on this record that stun or steal the spotlight away from the character and the persona and the story and the focus of the album. Which ultimately I think is a good thing, if anything the features, especially on a record like this, should be playing a more supportive role. The song I THINK right after this makes for a pretty interesting transition. I think the lo-fi production on this tracks obscures it, but this song is so friggen' Kanye West. I have never heard Tyler write a song that is so obviously Kanye. This track, the instrumental here, some of the flows. It's the dance beat, it's the glistening synths. This sounds just like something Kanye would rock during the graduation era, frankly. It is a very solid tune though, given the aesthetic of the album, the narrative of the record and the jazzy bridge that Tyler works into the track, he obviously puts his own spin on all of this. RUNNING OUT OF TIME in my opinion, not a bad track, but easily the weakest of the more mellow and soulful cuts on the first-leg of this record. I think the intro draws on a bit long, but it's still a necessary moment on the album. If not only for it's swirling, cascading synth-arpeggios and lush instrumental-bridge. Also, super cold-blooded verse at the ending of this track. And, what this song gives to the album narratively is that Tyler feels this relationship or his chances to save it, his ability to maintain this other person's interest is slipping away, he's losing his grip on it. All of this tracks up until this point do a very good job of setting the tone for the record, but after this we begin to enter banger territory. We get NEW MAGIC WAND, which is the first touch of real emotional darkness on the album in my opinion. Which is forecast by the instrumental's sinister electric-piano, the kind of skittery metallic bits of percussion in the instrumental that sound like spoons being hit onto dinner plates, the distant horror-movie synths, the growling distorted bass, of which there is quite a bit of on this entire album. Tyler's lyrics on this track seem to be coming from more of a place of extreme jealousy, violent psychosis, desperation. There's a love triangle angle presented in this track where Tyler essentially feels like he's competing with his significant-other's ex-girlfriend for attention, for love. He says he needs to ""get her out of the picture"". And, he genuinely seems like he's going mad on this track. It's like this Norman Bates style of ahhhhhh rahhhh total and absolute madness. And I also think this tracks illustrates exactly why the title of this record is what it is. We see this love, we see this relationship turning Tyler into IGOR, which is a name that typically is associated with monster, with freaks, with hideous beasts. A BOY IS A GUN is another stroke of genius in the track-list that is also obviously Kanye inspired. From the glamorous grooves to the pitched vocal-samples, as-well as some of the refrains on here. ♪ You so mother-fucking dangerous, You so mother-fucking dangerous ♪ This sounds exactly like something that would have landed on Kanye's first couple of records. Not to mention that, ""How come you the best to me? I know you the worst for me. You sweet and as sugar, diabetic to the first-degree."" That is the most Kanye line that Kanye has never written. And the rest of the lyrics on this though do continue to expose why exactly this relationship that Tyler is in is so bad for him and the other person. Their exchanges and interactions are just absolutely hideous. To the point where, I'm waiting for the relationship to be over. But again, the tone changes on the very next track, PUPPET, where Tyler now feels like he is being controlled by his addiction and his affection for this other person. Tyler's attitude essentially doing a total 180 from the last track and now he's bending over backwards doing everything that he can to keep this persons affection. The song eventually turns cinematic, with an instrumental shift presenting these marching snares, sparse twinkling melodies and dusty strings, it feels like a combo of an old-school soul song and a harrowing Bright Eyes ballad. Kanye West himself also makes an appearance in the second half of this track. It's a little buried, but it adds quite a bit to the song and occurs just before the instrumental turns the track into a slow downward elevator ride into hell. The track WHAT'S GOOD is easily the hardest and most aggressive cut on the entire record. I would say he's still in character here, though he does blatantly reference a car accident that he was in last year in the lyrics. We also hear this song right after a vocal-snippet ending the song PUPPET off, where somebody is saying ""but at some point you come to your senses"". Which is one of several moments on this album, where you catch these casual spoken-work snippets that sound like they're lifted from a conversation or an interview. Tyler even places one all by itself on the fourth track of the album. And, you might tune these moments out or not think too much of them on first listen, but please do pay attention. Because for the most part, these little passages do tend to forecast whatever the mood the next song is moving into. Anyways, WHAT'S GOOD, fierce delivery, fierce flows, bold noisy beat, truly evil attitude on this track. it's not my favourite tune on this entire record, but it is braggadocious, it is self-affirming and it is pivotal to the evolution of this relationship and of IGOR on this record. It's like continuously seeing the ego and the love of IGOR balloon and pop, balloon and pop throughout this record. So IGOR now has seen the light and the love this album is oriented around, it's GONE GONE. Which is a very bright and summery tune, the instrumental here might be trying to symbolize the euphoric bliss of breaking off a relationship that is very bad for you. There's very little on this track in-terms of feelings of regret, even with lyrics like ""At least i had it, instead of never or maybe I'm too dramatic"". This song is also a two-part track because eventually we transition into the THANK YOU side, which is built mainly off of a verse from Tyler where he's sort of confirming that he doesn't need this relationship, this is a good move for him. Him and this other person were working off of two different blueprints in the midst of a genius set of bars that reference buildings and architecture. I also quite a bit, the following track I DON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE. Instrumentally and vocally the song sounds so small, but emotionally this track is Tyler throwing a temper-tantrum. He's stomping around and saying ♪ I don't love you anymore ♪ And, it's hard to tell at points if he actually feels this way or if he's just saying this convince himself that that's what he wants to feel. Going deeper into the lyrics here does reveal emotions of wanting to move on, but necessarily knowing how. The instrumental on this track is dark, it's moody, it's painful, it's depressed. Not quite as happy about the breakup of this relationship as GONE GONE. And finally, ARE WE STILL FRIENDS is maybe one of my favourite closers of 2019. It birngs back the hokey soul-singer vibe of the first leg of the album, but i would say it goes even harder in that respect. With Tyler's voice just spotlit on a stage in front of backing bass and guitar. Very gentle, you have some backup-singers in there as-well, kind of buried drums. The track builds up to this vocal freakout that is actually pretty amazing It's a powerfully dramatic finish, but I can understand that you may not feel that way if you think the production is a little messy or muddy or if you haven't listened to the entire album up until this point. Because the song makes way more sense when you're viewing it through the weird lens that IGOR offers. Maybe the goofy background-vocals or the fake-ass synth-strings that are mixed very, very high. Maybe they don't do much for you. But, this track is actually amazing when you consider that it is the climax of what's essentially Tyler doing the musical equivalent to a one man play here. Of course, there are supporting musicians and artists, but you know what I mean. I do maybe have a few issues with the album though, there a few tracks where I think the structure and the development of the song could be better. Tyler also is wearing his influences on his sleeves very obviously throughout this record, to the point where it can be slightly distracting. And, while I do like the lo-fi aesthetic there are points where in the long-run of the track-list it does feel like it dampens the overall auditory experience. I might call it one-dimensional if not for the fact that the songs and narratives and emotions displayed throughout this album are so wide and vivid. I actually think the sound of this album is about as rich as the pink, black, white, grey colour palette of the album art here. It's obviously limited, but still presents a very compelling and sort of unsettling image. Overall I think IGOR is a fantastic album and is easily one of the best breakup albums of the decade. Which is no small feat considering that we're literally right toward the end of this decade. I'm feeling a decent to a strong 9 on this thing. Tran- -sition have you given this album a listen?

zHTFhBvSNaI,"hi everyone sinus pressure here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's it's time for a review of the brand-new Vampire Weekend album father of the bride this record is the latest from the Ivy League of indie pop Vampire Weekend sans original member rostam who's separated from the group a few years ago the gang is back although according to the production credits rostam does have input engineering and production wise on a couple of tracks here father of the bride is Vampire Weekend's fourth full-length album believe it or not it's been six years since the release of their last and critically acclaimed LP modern vampires of the city a record that featured some of the group's biggest singles and most lavish production yet and despite the waiting period that Vampire Weekend have put fans through on this one their popularity doesn't seem to have dropped off that far with this very album climbing up to number one on the Billboard album charts this week and I suppose it's not hard to see why Vampire Weekend is polarizing as they've been they've always had a style all their own something that no other group in their absence has been able to provide Ezra's whimsical tender and occasionally fun songwriting the band's impressive musicianship which is typically executed with style as well as their sharp fusions of pop and Baroque instrumentation in world music as much as I dislike the usage of that term but the teaser tracks to this record of which there were quite a few forecasts a very different sound and album for Vampire Weekend the track harmony Hall with it's sort of glam ish and very rich piano rock in the vein of the Rolling Stones there was also the funky and tightly composed sunflower featuring Steve Lacey of the internet fame the guitar licks and drums on this cut felt like something lifted off of an unknown mortal Orchestra album and as fun as some of the guitar work on this track is the song itself in my opinion is kind of forgettable the song big blue is a small cut with big jam band vibes coming off of it I love the tune but I think some of the guitars weave in with the synth choral vocals awkwardly placed onto the track in a kind of hideous way not really crazy about the brevity the song either the song this life is full flavored pop that just radiates Paul Simon it's eternally sunny and sounds like a bunch of bronzed skin boomers rocking out with Hawaiian shirts unbuttoned cargo shorts on Jimmy Buffett tats this song qualifies as one of maybe a few tracks on this record I might call post dad Rock so already from the teaser tracks on this record Vampire Weekend we're showing a pretty wide mix of sounds and styles I should also mention the father of the bride is the band's longest album to date at 18 tracks in almost an hour of runtime and while I did like a lot of songs off of this record I'm really not crazy with how this album panned out it is a bit of a long-winded mess and the more it goes on the more diminished the returns seem to be I get it's been a while and Ezra most likely has been sitting on a great deal of these tracks for a long time but I would have much preferred hearing this album pared down to its best 30 to 40 minutes of material it's certainly better than sitting through the auto-tune aneurysm that is spring snow or realizing how limited the songwriting on this record is sure peppered throughout the lyrics on this album there's different themes surrounding love broken love young love marriage but this album fails to build any kind of narrative around its incredibly narrow focus outside of the duets between Ezra and Daniel hiam where they're singing together at seemingly different points of a relationship entering marriage in a rocky fashion which is an idea and a concept rife with potential that father of the bride capitalizes on almost none of don't get me wrong though because there are some very good tracks on this record they're mostly on the front end of this thing but once we get past the first leg of the record I feel like the quality of every song thereafter is just like I don't know pulling a random card from a deck and you either get like an ace of spades or like a two of clubs there's the drab and an interesting rich man which is one of a few tracks on this record that features Ezra and company throwing in these forced quirky production choices that just sounds silly don't add that much flavor to the instrumental really just distract from the song I'm just not getting a lot out of the steelo fie guitar loops painting the background of this cut nor am I getting a lot out of the zany sound effects painting the background of the song how long which features some very nice writing from ezra easily one of the better hooks on the entire record but the instrumental backdrop is pretty lackluster there are also some really weird glitchy edits at certain points on the album like on the opening cut where you can hear the aftermath of the guitars being performed in the studio session like you're right there also hearing the course of singers on this track digitally stretched out as they enter into the song and I know these elements are supposed to give this album a raw and an intimate feel but it just comes off force this is not a loaf I record where on Sony its Vampire Weekend come on Steve Lacey on this track delivering some deadpan background vocals some of the robotic vocal effects on Ezra's voice the blurting horns the Latin drum section that comes off like a drunk dad Samba again another moment on the album where it feels like the instrumentation would rather distract from the song then serve it the song my mistake is a horrid attempt at trying to pull off some intimate sad downtrodden piano jazz which Ezra's voice just was not built for meanwhile the song sympathy is an acoustic rock rager the lowdown bassline the fierce strumming the handclaps on this cut feels like something out of an old Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds record but with what sounds like a synthesizer sampling a chorus of singers working in a very clunky awkward melody however I do love the ending of the track the drums that bust in they're heavy as hell the double basses Wow I'm sorry if I'm complaining for a lot of this review but I really do feel like Vampire Weekend unfortunately embraced quantity over quality on this one the band is obviously playing it more off-the-cuff which isn't a bad thing if wherever your artistic whims take you leads to one near genius moment after the next like the White Album but father of the bride is no white even on unbearably white I will say though even though there were a number of tracks on this record that had production choices that sort of bugged me a majority of these moments are still at least listenable and there are quite a few tracks from this record that i think are great all the Danielle Haim appearances on this record I think are fan tastic not only in terms of the vocal chemistry between her and Ezra but these songs attached are really solid too hi I'm also has some pretty prominent background vocals throughout multiple points most notably on the track stranger where the relationship themes throughout the record go domestic with its rich pianos and funky horns the track essentially sounds like a husband and wife dancing together in their underwear at their $500,000 summer home at the Cape as I mentioned earlier Harmony Hall amazing song amazing single I'm not really surprised that rostam had a huge hand in the production on this track because it is so friggin good it sort of makes me wonder how amazing the production could have been on the rest of the record if he was on the rest of the record still though Ezra was no slouch when it came to the songwriting on this track - I don't want to live like this but I don't want to die is easily one of the best refrains of 2019 the song bambina is amazingly cute and undeniably catchy with its killer percussion and the Boogie coming off the fuzzy guitar leads on this one it's one of the few songs on this record where it's instrumental quirk actually works in its favor the song this life I mentioned earlier amazing also the closing cut Jerusalem New York Berlin is a passable sad closure for the album yes it's a decent album but there's just too much flat too much flab in the tracklist and I'm not sure if there's much more to say than that they're just not all bangers sadly they're not all bangers and I think I'm going to leave it at that I'm feeling a decent 6 on this one

oqESEEskJI4,hey hey hey everyone Anthony Phan Tiano here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for a weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and worst tracks of the week as you may know I just had a tour so the week before the tour building up to the tour I missed a weekly track roundup and then because I was on tour for a whole week I missed another weekly track roundup so it's back but in this edition I'm gonna try to go back a little bit and cover some of the pivotal and notable songs that came out while I was gone so this is a bit of a catch up as well as a mention of a lot of the tracks that dropped this past week as well so it's a maybe a bit of a long episode but still gonna touch down and cover a bunch of tracks from a bunch of different artists I probably won't touch down on everything it's not gonna be as in-depth for every week I was gone as it would have been if I drop on that week but still you get what you get you get what you get alright let's first mention the Amazon and turntable lab associate links especially that turntable lab associate link if you want to buy yourself a colorful pressing of a record off of that page off of that link we get kicked back from it supports the channel supports the show and it's the worst track of the week everyone it's the worst tracks of the week of which there were there were quite a few honestly I'm sort of shocked you guys while I was gone you you really messed music up you really messed it up guys you couldn't have kept it nice and clean and orderly while I was gone no you had to come out with a bunch of terrible songs let's get into it first the Violent Femmes are back or rather just Violent Femmes the famed acoustic rock and punk and post-punk and art rock outfit they have a new song out Hotel last resort it's easily one of the most horrid and bland and boring songs the band had ever released I don't know who was asking for this and yet we got it moving out from there the hives are back reminding us that they are alive with a terrible new track easily one of the corniest they have ever released the vocals are god-awful the lyrics are weirdly chauvinistic and annoying and gross and I don't know they're just still trying to peel to rather trying to uphe'll to these generic old-school rock-and-roll isms just translating them through a bit of a punk lens it's kind of stale at this point you know it's kind of stale at this point it was really sort of starting to run out of gas by the time of their third record and they're still pushing it and it doesn't really sound any more interesting or refreshing so it's a pretty lackluster in my view pretty lackluster I'm moving on from there Cepheid Oh sunshine is the name of their new track over here easily the most I don't know navel-gazing and inconsequential song that the legendary lo-fi indie outfit has dropped from their forthcoming record kind of disappointing it's it's really been a mixed bag of tracks teasing toward this album and I wonder how exactly this thing is gonna pan out moving on from there Passion Pit and galantis go sunshine touched indie pop fused with EDM on this new track I found you it's aggravating and super glitzy you know I mean I'm sure there are great intentions behind the song and everything like that but I just do not really care for hearing passion pits already very sugary songwriting thrown into a bit of an EDM context I just really don't I'm moving on from there Madonna has seen fit to release two god-awful songs over the past couple of weeks one with sway Lee and one with quavo she is really trying her best to appeal to just the the current trend of trap and trap fuse with pot and yeah both tracks future and crave are are awful she dropped another track this week that was a solo cut that I thought was absolutely forgettable this new record that she has coming out very soon is not shaping up to be all that great in my view in my opinion moving out from their edge here in and Justin Bieber I don't care the they get together on this one and I kind of go into depth on this track on a track of you over on the Fantana channel if you do wish to watch it over there but the Biebs and Ed Sheeran get together here and they come together with absolutely bland trash on this one vocally there is absolutely no chemistry the instrumental is bland and I don't know you you wouldn't remember if it were somebody else's instrumental I'll tell you that and the song lyrics themselves are yeah well like literally no effort was put into this track just throw it into the recycle bin moving on from there Bruce Springsteen has put out another cut and yeah vocals and productions sounding incredibly rough on this one not really getting where Bruce is going with this latest record of his there goes my miracle is the name of this latest one and also dude insipid lyrics on this track totally insipid stomach-churning lyrics on this song I just did not get it moving on from there Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie Fame has seen fit to do a cover of the Minor Threat song filler on piano it's it's trash let's it's let's not even get even any deeper into it than that kyo cheese no this is this is the biggest heartbreak of me for the week frankly the biggest heartbreak of the week my dude Alex Cameron has come through with a brand new track if there is one artist whose record I have been just hotly anticipating in 2019 is definitely Alex Cameron's as last length LP force forced witness I think is one of the most captivating funny and enchanting singer-songwriter records of the decade but this new track over here which is titled Miami memory is is not so much the case I do think the lyrics are pretty funny lyrically Alex is definitely on the ball here but the rough distorted almost industrial drum in flying on this cut totally tears away any potential appeal of it whatsoever just the production has got awful the instrumentation has got awful it does not serve the song in my opinion it's just very rigid it's very obnoxious totally distracts from everything that alex is doing with the tune of the track with his vocals with his lyrics with the story just do not get what he was trying to achieve with the production on this one sounds like a total mess sounds like a total mess to me moving on from there we also have a brand new track from Africa Express which is a new music project spearheaded by Damon Albarn of gorillas Fame it's supposed to be like a multicultural outfit with artists all around the world many of whom do have roots in Africa but a great deal of them just seem to be like white dudes from sort of relevant but also some underground pop in indie groups and yeah it just sort of sounds like very gentrified African ish pop music I don't really get the appeal of this project the tune that they have T is here Johannesburg featuring rough rice of Super Furry Animals marina liberal or Abba Radio 1 2 3 and SIBO is drab is uninspired not really that flavorful on the instrumental side of things and yeah again just not really seeing what exactly the angle or the appeal of this is maybe subsequent singles and teasers will be more interesting I hope so but as of right now as far as like a first taste for this project its it's not a very exciting one let's move on to the track so I thought were kind of meh not blowing me away but certainly worth mentioning first off we have a brand new cut from tricot titled butter and yeah I'm not so sure if I'm crazy about this one usually the group is a bit more of a math rock endeavor this song sees them putting out more of the ballad with more R&B vibes behind it which is not inherently a bad thing but I think their songwriting could have used a bit more tuning on this one frankly moving on from there titus andronicus has dropped a brand new track as well it is a wild rowdy screamed distorted piece of folk punk with a lot of attitude maybe not my favorite tune that they have dropped in a while but still still solid tumult around the world is the title of it moving on from there a brand new cut as well from Jack White's The Rock contours I think the vintage rock and roll vibes on this one are cool but the vocals to come together in an absolutely horrid way the way they're layered the way they're not so much harmonized but slurred over each other in a very messy unlikable fashion moving on from their unsane tit is the name of the brand new single from Slipknot just kind of sounds like Slipknot playing it by the numbers on this one really playing it by the numbers and not much else they're just kind of working the regular not blueprint here with the the soaring clean vocals on the chorus the scream manic but rapped vocals on the versus those grimy riffs pretty hard-hitting drums the one thing that really stood out to me is that um I guess and I guess the bridge seemed a little black metal inspired I suppose but that's that's really it honestly that was really it moving on from there we have a couple of new tracks from UK rapper Skepta I'm not gonna say that these are two of his best songs sort of seems like he hopped on some very trendy instrumentals very trendy trap inspired instrumentals put together some basic refrains and just tried to come together with I don't know a couple of the most easy to have stuck in your head songs that he possibly could bullet from a gun in Gries mode whose lyrics are easily the corniest of the two are the songs that he put out here moving on from there Mark Ronson has a new cut out sort of seems like with all these new tracks of his he's trying to strike this like very dramatic lavish ballad formula the Miley Cyrus single is in my opinion the best example of it so far this new cut over here featuring Yabba is maybe the weakest so far I really don't know mark ronson you know he's very very hit or miss you know he'll come out with a record a project that is in a certain style a certain sound going for a certain vibe he'll come out with like several amazing songs in that sound and then all of them will just like you know drop off from there and this is definitely an example of that in my opinion it's very one-dimensional very bland singer absolutely nondescript and the tune is pretty weak to move not from there lana del rey has done a cover of Sublime's Sublime's do in time which is is pretty faithful to the original nothing much changed up outside of just a dreamy er aesthetic and you know on as usual vocal style came out okay came out okay you know if you're looking for her to kind of reinvent the wheel here it's it's not gonna happen yeah it's a very straightforward rendition I'm moving out from their idols have released what seems like a track that could have been from the sessions from their latest record it's very roughly recorded and performed it's a song that I guess I'm not that surprised ended up on the cutting room floor here but you know if you're looking for another dose rougher dose of the Bands politically-charged in your face very guttural and and nasty art punk sound then give this a try holy ghost has come through with another disco flavor jam do this is the title of the song it's a pretty fun pretty sweet pretty straightforward nothing all that new for the duo but still again pretty likable Flying Lotus has come through with a brand new track another teaser from his big big big record coming out very soon this new one features none other than Anderson Pak and I do think the track eventually smooths out into a decent song into a decent tune but to get to that point God the intro is an incredibly rough and very messy and not in a likeable way easily one of flylo's worst arrangements instrumentally and vocally that I think he's ever put forward not sure what to say outside of that yeah I'm just sort of hoping this is a song that ends up wowing me once I hear it in the context of the entire album but as a standalone moment I'm just not really feeling it just just not chance the rapper and Tisa Korean has come through with a new track with production from Berta beats groceries I just kind of seems like a very absurd trap flavored banger with a lot of very silly one-liners and weird lyrics just to be playful and tongue-in-cheek and strange and again I'll say the word absurd so nothing too substantive or memorable or I guess groundbreaking from chance but if you want to hear a banger this is kind of likable alone is just trying to be as ridiculous as possible give it a shot Carly Rae Jepsen has come through with another teaser to her new album which is out now not gonna talk too much about it as I am gonna be reviewing her new album soon too much is the name of the track I think it's a little I think it's a tad over produced frankly but um you know just letting you guys know letting you guys know that I am planning on reviewing this record making you aware so I'm gonna review the record so you don't got to ask me every 10 minutes moving on from there Baroness has another track out that they are teasing to their new album with throw me an anchor is the title of this new one and this is another instance of the production on this track not feeling as full as it has on past efforts and I wasn't really all that impressed with the song on this one either not really getting where Baroness is coming from her going with this new set of tracks they have really been a mixed bag in my view and I don't know just not as excited for this Baroness record as I would like to be frankly due to the songs they have been showing fans up to the release and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best from the past few weeks there were quite a few you know the past couple of weeks were nada were not all bad for sure first off Tyler egor earthquake new album out now I did a full track review for the song over on the fan no channel if you want to watch that and see my full opinion check it out over there I do love the track I think the weird III guess left-field soul direction Tyler is taking this song in was pretty likable and I will leave it at that movin out from there a new song from a duo a married duo by the name of summer camp love of my life it is a lavish piece of well arranged pop music with some sort of weak lead vocals but it's still very endearing and cute very lovely pop tune do not miss out on and do not miss out on it moving on from there purple mountains is a new music project featuring David Berman of silver Zhu's Fame I do not know how many people out there who watch these videos watch my channel are fans of silver Jews know about the group's history and the amazing albums they came out with back in the day but silver Jews were a great band that ended far too early in my opinion although they did have a very nice run although it was you know still sad to see David Berman sort of you know fall into obscurity a little bit and now he is back essentially with this new band new project new song out titled all my happiness is gone and even though this is a different project it's not really all that different than some of the stuff he was doing when he kind of put silver Jews at finish it's somewhat low five very downtrodden indie rock with a strong singer/songwriter edge and very poetic lyrics and David Berman's trademark somewhat deadpan forlorn lead vocal is there and yeah it just sort of sounds good to hear him back and it sounds like he's got a reason to be back you know I would like to think that someone would not come out with a new record if it were not for a need or a desire to put out more music and it sounds like David is very much back in his wheelhouse with this new track over here so moving on from there a brand new cut from a project by the name of men I trust Norton commander is the name of this cut it's very hip and a gadget piece of dream pop maybe a little generic by standards of the genre but I just found the production to be incredibly intoxicating and the lead vocals to be whispery and sweet like a great ASMR video moving on from there another Mavis Staples track this one featuring none other than I want to say Ben Harper on vocals with her and it's it's a very lovely tune very lovely track very lovely song a great piece of blues and soul here definitely looking forward to this new Mavis Staples album also want to talk about the new Holly Herndon record very soon and just point you guys to this new song over here titled frontier which is a great abstract piece of abstract vocal layered insanity I'm not gonna say anything more than that give it a try it's absolutely off-the-wall Black Mountain destroyer another fun track from the throwback rock outfit Black Mountain and I don't know just like a lot of weird vintage guitar leads and crazy male/female vocal harmonies and shouts and layers and a lot of attitude I love some of the chunky riffs played throughout this track as well if you like to hear a band that does a good throwback not not like a crummy throw it in the garbage Greta Van Fleet throwback a quality throwback give this band a shot give this track a shot moving on from there moving on from there Ricky brand new track from Denzel curry did a track review for this over on the Fantana Channel loved the Banger beat love denzel's flow here love the Family Values coming out of the lyrics and yeah yeah I just think the track is great tracks fantastic moving on from there I do love the new collaboration from Charli XCX and Liz oh it's very catchy it's a very futuristic weird piece of pop super super infectious chorus Liz's performance on the back end of the track is charismatic and fun and yeah sure it's it's one of Charlie's a more saccharine and sugar-coated cuts it's not as abstract ER as freakish or as weird as some of her best material but I do think this track sits at a good crossroads you know there are some strange and I said futuristic elements of the the beat on this one that I think are pretty cool and Charlie's vocal performances pretty solid in the hole I loved hook of the song is is super-sticky moving on from there we have another track from the band black MIDI that I've been mentioning on numerous occasions in these weekly track roundup so this one Talking Heads is a pretty great frantic track with lots of weird angular guitar leads and some I don't know blood pumping lead vocals I just love the way the band is um I don't know so so abstract and so spastic and so visceral and that has been it for the weekly track round up everybody thank you very much for watching all the songs that I had mentioned in this video are linked down below in the description you can try them out all there and I will catch you guys in the next video Anthony Fantana we track roundup 
vNw9TGSY1EM,ah-ah-ah hi everyone were thneed rope tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Mac DeMarco album here comes the cowboy Wow just in case you're out of the loop just in case you've been living under a rock here comes the cowboy is the latest full-length LP from Canadian native and one of the most popular singers songwriters in the underground of music currently mr. Mac DeMarco this is his first album since I guess ending his longtime partnership with capture tracks since this is being released on Mac's record label and I was pretty excited to review this one not only because of the creative upward trajectory that I saw Mac on thanks to his solidly catchy another one mini album that dropped several years ago and also let's not forget the mature and personal direction that he took his songwriting in on 2017 s this old dog the fact that Mac is now independent is also pretty exciting given rumors of creative frictions with his label previously so maybe now that he's flying solo we will finally hear the album that he's been dying to make also the first single from this album nobody sure it had some very obviously read vibes but it was a pretty fantastic tune a beautiful ballad that found power in its well written lyrics in its subtlety in its simplicity and I think there are a few other tracks here that achieved that same goal the song preoccupied with its lazy acoustic guitars its gentle percussion and the sound of birds tweeting in the background it's like I'm just listening to Mack perform this song in the moment organically in the middle of nature there's also the romantic and very synth-heavy heart-to-heart whose chord progression and fuddy bass is bitter sweet and cute it's a song that's big on romance but small on volume and the swelling synth chords on the hook create just enough contrast for it to function Mac really does try to get away with the bare minimum instrumentally on a lot of these tracks he is purposefully being minimal here seeing Mac go in an even simpler direction isn't necessarily a bad thing but jeez a majority of this record is just so lifeless and it's not even that the vibe of this album is Mel it's really that Mac is delivering some of his most one-dimensional songwriting yet a lot of the writing on this project is painfully redundant and doesn't feature anywhere near as much personality as his previous material in a way you could say the opening track on this record sets the tone for the entire album in that it is Mac lethargically playing these folk country guitar chords and just singing the same lyrics over them again and again and again for three minutes until it just fades out and the obviously related hey cowgirl later on the album is almost as tedious if Mac isn't taking the piss here he's most certainly doing it on the song choo-choo which sounds like a bad gorillas rip off like a gorilla's d side or g side or really just like Zee side it's like this really awkward absurd funk with chicka-chicka guitars and train whistles the closing track on this thing is also completely thankless feels like Mac is just trying to kill more time for whatever reason I guess with him doing this record independently there's no one there to tell him hey dude you're just putting filler on this album it's just filler all our yesterday's and on the square are okay tracks but songwriting wise they just pretty much sound like Mac DeMarco by the numbers it's like we've heard him write these songs before but better the track finally alone sort of picks up the pace and the first leg of the album with its bland disco rhythms but outside of that vintage groove there's not really a whole lot here that's all that novel or interesting there's also the laughable Scylla's moon which features some very awkward crooning for Mac DeMarco it sounds like what you would get if you forced Mac and Tom York into a very horrible collaboration with it's sour and sad guitar chords and terrible pacing and I don't know there's not much else here to cover this is a very scant album that doesn't have a whole lot going for it there's no real concept or aesthetic changes here for Mac DeMarco all you could really say is that again he's going in a supremely repetitive and minimalist direction on this one just trying to I don't know maybe embrace some slow core or experimental singer-songwriter ideas maybe he's been listening to some Red House Painters or some Jim O'Rourke I don't know whatever is inspiring this change of pace for Mac it's it's really not translating in his songs as I think this thing is his worst album since blowing up and is devoid of anything interesting much of the time I'm feeling a decent two strong three on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up worthy willing to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Mac DeMarco here comes the cowboy forever 
lfXh-qAoZNg,hi everyone said any face here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new logic album confessions of a dangerous mind this is the latest full-length LP from Maryland rapper logic which comes shortly after the release of quite possibly his worst project yet Supermarket a soundtrack to a now best-selling book of the same title and the 13 songs on this record see logic trying his hand at acoustic ballad REE indie pop alternative rock all of his attempts of which turn out pretty awful oh yeah bro I'm big Logic fan but even that appalam to me big cringe so big cringe well look in my opinion logic has always been a rapper who has been punching under his weight and I did see a lot of potential in his initial albums in his breakthrough mixtapes the playful bars the speedy flows and the incredible versatility but that versatility later just evolved into logics lack of an overall voice as he just needed to copycat one sound an idea an artist after another in order to pad his projects out to full album or mixtape length pretty much every project he's dropped up until this point has at least a handful of songs that ride on the coattails of Drake or J Cole or Kendrick and there's even a track off this new record where he has a flow and an inflection that feels like he's doing his best JIT impression like if all these artists stopped putting out music tomorrow what would logic do he would really have nowhere left to go and yet he has amassed this audience that just seems addicted to his mediocrity in a way I guess you got to give it to the guy because he's supremely good at taking better hip-hop pulling anything subversive out of it and refining it down for audiences that don't have the framework to understand why he's in a far lower creative tier than his contemporaries who he blatantly rips off this downward trajectory that logic has been on since projects like the incredible true story I thought was going to pick up after supermarket after all how could he put out a worse album and I guess in a way confessions does jump over the bar more it sort of just crawls over the bar I guess the reason for that being the sound and the style of this record with it just being a straightforward hip-hop album is just more in logics wheelhouse he's definitely more in his element here but I'm still at a loss with this album because as far as hip-hop records go this is easily logics worst his most uninspired his most unimpressive so far multiple tracks on this album feature logic endlessly complaining about how people online don't like him it's essentially Russ 2.0 also quite a few bars on this album with logic feeling insecure about being called gay over social media when logic isn't doing this he's flexing and delivering some bland braggadocio without much in the way of wit or wordplay tracks like these also come along with the narrow-minded belief that logic made it just because he tried harder and he did the work and meanwhile all the other artists out there and his haters are just lazy and they did they didn't do it he did seems logic thinks his success has nothing to do with his delivery of bland inoffensive hip-hop for suburban nights who think caring about real rap means that you listen to someone who raps fast even if when they're rapping fast they sound like crap because their words bleed together to the point where you can't even really tell what they're saying on top of that on this very album on ironically logic pretty much says that he he doesn't care about lyrics he says it right here in these lyrics on the track don't be afraid to be different and honestly I have to agree there is nothing impressive about logic spend game on this record in fact I would say the lyrics on this album get downright awful when he's spinning about wanting to be bipolar because Kanye's bipolar falsely thinking that maybe if I guess he had some sort of chemical imbalance he'd be creative too there's also the the line on here about him having a biracial penis there are quite a few bars on this thing I would much rather just like to forget as soon as possible but to go back to this lyric where he's writing about not caring about lyrics whatever spirit he's referring to feeling here in this couplet and I'm not feeling it not feeling it at all I'm not against the idea of a rapper or an artist in any other genre making music just for the feeling of it over the lyricism but when you get down to brass tacks on certain tracks here there's really nothing to feel because logic picked generic instrumentals totally half-assed the verses half-assed the hooks some of which are painfully repetitive or he just spends his time goofing off to the point where he sounds ridiculous the song I see the song cocaine the song Keanu Reeves which in no way lyrically doesn't reference back to Keanu Reeves in a witty or creative way to justify the title in the hook of the song the song limitless as well and as I said earlier when logic isn't delivering these completely vapid substance list verses he is just whining and crying about the things people say about him on the Internet the song clickbait the song wannabe these bitter annoying gross tracks that see logic portraying himself is you know just like Duncan on his haters and so on and so forth but it's painfully apparent to anybody else listening outside that wow this like really gets to you dude I'm serious talk to someone who has some kind of emotional investment in you and unpack this stuff because it's coming out in your music in not the most healthy way and yet through his lyrics it's logic who would like for us to believe that it's his haters who have the unhealthy obsession and I know logic has haters but I mean the dudes not that grading he's not that controversial he's not one of these 15 minutes of fame social media rappers who rode in on a wave of hate and for whatever naysayers out there logic does have he has far far far more fans it just seems like logic doesn't have any perspective on this stuff because in reality his haters are pretty much doing what they've always done they're just talking trash but meanwhile you're the one making yourself look ridiculous investing so much time into responding to them which is okay to some degree and I hate that I'm talking about this topic this much in a music review but really like logic makes it difficult to get around because it's a prime focus to this album considering this the album cover itself makes sense when you look at logic skin melting skeleton coming out and he's holding a friggin phone the phone being the source of that hatred the social media the drama though I mean there are points on here where he brings up the biracial thing as if he's just trying to trigger those hater so they go crazy when he says he's biracial so I'm gonna say it oh the mad lad he did it I can't believe it I guess what's even more disappointing than all of this that I've been talking about so far are the features on this record there's a totally pointless Wiz Khalifa appearance on here where it's not even a really whizzes fault logic goes so friggin hard on the flow and the tone of this song to the point where you know Wiz is coming up but why would you put him on a track like this you know he's just going to come on to the song rapping slow sounding high out of his mind that's what he does if you have a STONER anthem or just kind of a chill lay back on your record put him there that makes sense Gucci Mane seems to have showed up for the check really phoned it in on this one putting gez and logic on a track together seems to be the musical equivalent of taking a slice of Wonder Bread putting another slice of Wonder Bread on top and just biting in and Will Smith surprisingly enough turns up on the back end of this record with a cringy introduction referencing back to the Fresh Prince of bel-air theme as the verse progresses he reminds us why his rap career is essentially over at this point that misfits shout out though that misfits shada good job Jayden pep-pep is proud of you logics own father appears at the very end of the song Bobby where he just rants and raves about logics naysayers and his haters and so on and so forth he literally brought his dad on to his record to stand up for him one more thing I should mention while I'm talking about the features on this record is the Eminem appearance on the song homicide which was a teaser track to this album and while I thought Eminem's performance on this cut was pretty entertaining all I can really say about the song overall is that it turned out better than I thought it would have been given the level of quality that logics and Eminem's music recently has has been at I'm just tired of this I'm just tired this was obnoxious this was awful and what's even more terrible is that it was unlikable it was it was sad because being likable and being that friendly approachable relatable kid who's kind of above it all being that everyman that you wanted to root for even if his music was just okay that was what was essentially keeping me in logics corner up until this point but now that that attitude is just gone now he just seems way too focused and obsessed and butthurt over irrelevant crap and I don't know what to say all of his belly aching over the sliver of people who don't like him does it translate in anything compelling or worthwhile and not to say that logic can't be legitimately unhappy or depressed or stressed out over his career in the music industry and and what people say about him but honestly throughout this entire record there's nothing in the way of any profound observation or analysis of why things are the way they are and how it came to be this way logics understanding an autopsy of all of this is all just very basic and surface level the best tracks on this record are easily the first couple the cut that features YB and Corday is pretty fantastic as well as Corday proves himself to be the best feature on the entire project even though he does rap for a very short amount of time and there are a few promising instrumentals on the record but nothing that outshines the severe averageness of logics verses and his hooks logics worst rap album again by a very large margin in my opinion I'm feeling a strong one - a light - on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i er to be next hit the like

Rccn_Hobk6s,ah hi everyone I've been 'back tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the Slauson malone album a quiet Farwell 2016 to 2018 this is the debut full-length solo album of slice and Malone aka Jasper Armstrong Marsalis son of jazz musician Wynton Marsalis Malone is also a member of standing on the corner and experimental music collective based out of New York that you might have caught a feature credit from on Earl sweatshirts last full-length album some rap songs which is something honestly I had forgotten about going into this album and I had basically just tried it off of the generous buzz I had seen swirling around it online and I'm very glad I did this project of tracks recorded from 2016 to 2018 features a truly unique collision of sounds and influences obviously jazz and hip hop sits pretty firmly at the base of what Malone is doing on much of this record not only given his previous output especially with the standing on the corner collective but also his family background but the 20 pieces throughout this record also feature elements of glitch and plunder phonics and sound collage some of which has been a cornerstone of hip hop for a very long time when you're talking about some of the most significant and cutting-edge producers and samplers in the genre the bomb squad Stein ski dust brothers DJ shadow but in comparison to Quiet Farwell is very different from all of that much more abstract and surreal partially what's here seems like the logical conclusion to the west coast be seen that was very much fostered by Flying Lotus as brain feeder records with of course a bit of J Dilla and mad lib and Stones Throw tossed in for good measure there are also elements of this project that very much remind me of weird band camp beat tapes as well as some vaporwave with how some of the samples are stretched out chopped repeated there are some edits and sound pallets on this project that very much remind me of Lofa music of tape music some of the strange piano samples and instrumental manipulations throughout this record also read to me like an old microphones album or at least like the abstract hip-hop equivalent should probably also say if you're a huge fan of some of the hip-hop experimentation that used to go down on anti Kon records you will most likely dig this too it's a pretty unique and spectacular combination of sounds aesthetically there's a lot here that also is pretty similar to Earl's some rap songs last year but executed in a wildly different fashion as I said earlier this project is 20 tracks and they all build up to 30 minutes or so in runtime so a majority of the cuts here whizzed by pretty quickly and not to say their entrance or their exit at any point on this album is unimpressive but the magic of this record can't really be boiled down to a handful of single tracks rather all these small short collage based cuts throughout this record build together into a larger weirder collage that is ever-changing moving from low fight on ting about soul jazz to slo-mo vapor rap where the rapper on the track has a very narrow low-pass filter on his voice so it sounds like he's rapping on the other side of like a foot of concrete even though some of the instrumental and sonic changes within and between tracks can be kind of odd and jarring it all flows together pretty nicely it's like I'm constantly teleporting from one room to another but it's all very cohesively happening within this Lynch Ian Black Lodge of sorts or like I'm endlessly flipping TV channels on a television that only features broadcasts from another dimension at this point in the review I would start pulling out certain tracks and saying this song sounds like this and this track does this and this track features this but as I said there's not really a whole lot that can be gained by observing or explaining one two three or four single tracks on this album the watery guitars incredibly wide variety of beats the tinny bass the monotone rappers the grimy horns and weird samples and interludes they all melt into each other pretty effectively to create this very subtle but freakish vibe that is equal parts relaxing introspective and personal but also like out-of-body and transcendent I know current day on the music market there is a lot of value put on music that just creates a vibe is little wavy trippy trap music alternative are be just playlists that create a nice pleasant sensation when I'm trying to reach that wavelength this is a record I would much rather do that with because while I can't put this record on and kind of lay back and chill and not have to dive too deeply into any one thing happening because nothing lasts all that long anyway this project does stay consistently stimulating and intriguing and beautiful its ear candy for those who want to hang out in the candy aisle where only the weird candies are like mambas and carob raisins and popcorn jelly bellies and pickled flavored mints my biggest nitpick on this record is of the elements that are a bit more obvious and accessible in the soul and the regions of the album they do come off a bit derivative and are obviously inspired by the likes of Odd Future also some of the guest features on this record calling them features is kind of generous in my opinion especially since many of their voices are sort of treated just like another piece of sound or instrumentation or a sample on any given track here I would love to hear a project like this in the future where maybe some of these singers and rappers appearing on it are a bit more of a show stopper more interesting but still as is quiet far well is a pretty fantastic and adventurous listen I would even argue inventive in its combination of sounds and influences and how it executes them I'm definitely in love with this record if you are a more adventurous listener who wants to hear the current underground of hip-hop music fed through the most abstract meat grinder then give this thing a shot I'm feeling a decent of strong 8 on this transition have you given this record listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a another video

W1oNvg-AKs0,haha hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another edition of the why you know review where i go over a series of albums that dropped over the past month or so didn't get a chance to do a formal review so i'm going to talk about them in brief in a gauntlet in one video you know what we do not just because you may have seen a previous episode in the series but because i also literally explained it to you just now so let's get into those reviews above am [Music] multi-instrumentalist songwriter and noted whistler andrew bird is back with a brand new album which he cheekily titled my finest work yet and i i do agree with the sentiment to a degree in that it's it's certainly his most ambitious sounding album in a while and definitely one of his more dramatic releases yet as a lot of his records prior were very elegant but kind of low key chamber indie folk and pop so to hear andrew bird on record just acting a bit more dramatic just really jumping out at you in the mix vocally is nice change of pace however i think a lot of the songwriting on this record is kind of watered-down lackluster not nearly as good as his previous efforts especially during his artistic peak in the 2000s on top of it it seems like there's a bit of a stylistic shift with andrew's music on this record it's like he's pulling a lot from the very dramatic and lavish full crock music of the 1970s and as a result of that he almost sounds exactly like father John misty on some of the tracks from this record especially on the track Sisyphus the similarities there are actually kind of disturbing but yeah outside of that I'm not really sure what to to make of this one it's definitely one of his more notable and exciting albums in a while but is it his finest work yet I know I'm not supposed to take the title of this thing seriously but it still falls short of the claim this new record from UK hip-hop duo last sons who I first heard of after an appearance on an uncommon NASA record a couple of years ago uncommon NASA New York hip-hop artist producer also produced every single song on this new record from the duo which is pretty cool however listening to these guys in a more expanded context on an entire record has not really drawn me to their style or sound all that much honestly lyrically I feel like a lot of this record is just a little too abstract esoteric a little too pretentious there are some genius and super catchy cuts on here and in smart instances of commentary like the corporate-owned eeeh cut that I thought was really cool but for the most part my only real takeaway from this record is is just how good the beats are you know I do love uncommon asses very weird clunky noisy and progressive style of hip hop production and it's easily the the best aspect of this project just didn't really care for the rapping all that much frankly [Music] pivot gang is a rap collective connected to the very popular right now Chicago hip hop artist known as Saba a lot of people in my audience big fans of this guy me not as much up until this point but open to kind of having my mind change with future material I in fact hope that that would be the case after hearing him in this context with the rest of pivot gang and while I do appreciate some of the subtle jazz rap influences on this record and as far as modern trap and pop rap goes this is certainly more thoughtful and more mature than what you're going to stumble upon anywhere else on the Internet however I just found every rapper on this thing to be more nondescript than the last nobody really had a distinct style or voice or sound or anything just kind of sounded like a very young group of guys with a very small pool of influences that they're all very obviously pulling from and I don't know just kind of fell very bland [Music] if Rukiya electrique are a Tunisian band who just dropped their second full-length album over here and listen guys this is a really cool combination of influences on this record if you like listening to north african music west african music you're talking about the chance the drums and thrown on top of that like heavy noisy industrial style guitars almost like if you were taking that genre of music and mixing it with some old-school swans or some Glenn Branca or something yeah that's that's literally what you're getting here it's unlike anything I've ever heard before however I do think a lot of the group vocals meld very awkwardly with the heavy industrial and noise rock guitars on this record if not for them coming together in such a weird fashion where something just feels off I think I would be praising this record a lot more because the combination of sounds and styles on this thing is just - amazing and too ambitious not to admire at least to some degree even if the execution is sort of off I would recommend this to anybody who is venturous wants to hear a refreshing combination of sounds yeah gotten quite a few requests to review this new Lolo zoo I record this France natives new album is a combination of R&B very chill very beat heavy very atmospheric a bit of hip-hop influenced as well it's okay there are a few tracks here where the songwriting or even Lolo's vocal delivery is kind of stunning and beautiful but there are also quite a few tracks here that just feel like very atmospheric gentrified bland R&B wallpaper it's really kind of a mixed bag I think if I'm gonna be wowed by this artist at some point in the future the songwriting and the singing across the entire record is going to need to be just a bit bolder but hey if you are looking for something on that R&B spectrum that is a bit moodier and artsy ER and atmospheric and relaxed - give it a try why is this Fox Jen album such a mess I mean the production's not utter trash but I feel like we're almost going back to the and starpower days where we're almost going back to that and that's just kind of a disappointment here the duo back in a position where their songwriting has gotten weaker and their instrumentals are such a junk pile of different influences and ideas on this record that almost nothing is complementing each other on some tracks on this record and it just ends up sounding like a total mess and I'm letdown Fontaine's DC an Irish indie rock and post-punk outfit who dropped a couple of tracks in teasing toward this latest record there's their debut album that I was pretty enamored with but after getting a chance to hear the entire record as far as post-punk revival ISM goes this to my ears is just very mild it's very average it's very run-of-the-mill the performances I think are pretty underwhelming generally across the record the vocals while they do have a very endearing Irish twang to them there's not a whole lot about the vocal performances that I think are all that thrilling or exciting the band truly fails to string together some ballads and some songwriting that are really snappy and memorable nor are they really able to put the pedal to the metal and come through with some recordings and performances here that are just exciting thrilling electrifying like you may expect out of an album that's so obviously influenced by punk music but yeah I had some high hopes for this album but unfortunately it just came out very much alright another record from the Buddhist band they are back after five years since their last album and they are bringing their usual blend of jazz funk and funk rock obviously pulling on some more afro beat influences on this one obviously pulling on some more psyche influences on this one if you look at the cover on this thing it actually kind of looks like the the front of a doom metal album and you know it's it's no lie it's not a tease this is easily the Buddhist band's darkest record yet and how do they create that atmosphere with more distortion with a lot more reverb to the point where it's actually swallowing the mix and making the song is a bit hard to listen to I mean if you really want to hear the group at their darkest and most sinister you most likely will not want to miss this record but I feel like in a way that we're already kind of pointing in this direction with their last album which if you look at the governor of looks like a stoner metal cover and that album also contains some some very dark material the new Devin Townsend record is mixed awfully and I do not get the appeal of it I mean some of the weird compositional Frank Zappa isms and maybe even I could say mr. bungle isms thrown into this record where he kind of jabs you with these weird quick hits of jazz or some quirky other classical progressions that sort of thing I mean that's cool but generally what you're hearing here is just some very grand and trying to be epic rock metal that is just bricked out and compressed to the point where all of these very very corny orchestral embellishments and arrangements thrown on top of these riffs are just kind of like drowned out in the super thick mix the vocals are subpar as well I just do not get the appeal of this record unless you're just like a ride-or-die Devin Townsend fan I really don't need from the atmospheric sludge metal outfit inter ARMA I've never been crazy about their output up until this point and I feel like that just continues to be the case on this latest LP even though it is being pretty well received by fans and it does blend an interesting mix of underground metal genres but for the most part to my ears it just feels like very meat and potatoes sludge very drawn out very washed out guitar tones or dime-a-dozen vocals or dime-a-dozen it does have a kind of epic winding feel to and then if you do love the subtle notes of black metal and doom being thrown into the mix maybe this album will kind of wow you were when you over but for the most part the sound of it for this genre I don't know just very average [Music] we knew Kelsey Liu record blood has been getting quite a bit of tension across the internet and I can certainly see why when it comes to very moody and mystical and varied albums of art pop music Kelsie Liu certainly does bring some refreshing and new flavors to the table her talents as a cellist certainly do her a lot of favors across many tracks on here and the amalgamation of influences that come together on this record are pretty cool too there are moments on this thing where vocally and also in terms of her songwriting she kind of reminds me of Kimbra or Solange or even a bit of Bjork maybe even a touch of Lord or some of the darker tracks have come out from the knife over the years while all of this is fine though I can't help but feel just underwhelmed by this album I'm just constantly being given reminders of other things that it's obviously pulling from but honestly I think the record is just a little too all over the place and I couldn't quite get a taste of what exactly makes Kelsie Liu distinct amongst the current field of art pop artists that have made waves over the past decade though if you consider yourself a hardcore art pop fan and you like to try and listen to every record in the genre that comes out you will most likely not want to miss this what a hideous obnoxious pop album it just makes indie pop sound so unlikable from the uppity beats to the very nasally and whiny and grading vocals this is really a slog to listen to I don't know what else to say as much as I was psyched for this new wond album based on a few tracks teasing toward its release I was kind of disappointed to hear that while I do like the variations across this record and the psychedelic vibes throughout some of these tracks the songwriting the vocals just feel very dime a dozen feel very general the production's good if you are a huge psych head wand is easily one of the more instrumentally creative and diverse bands out there especially on this album but I don't really find a whole lot of creativity and the singing in again the songwriting in the way a lot of these tracks are composed frankly I don't know it's it's definitely their most vibrant release that I've heard and one of their more ambitious records but it doesn't really go quite far enough to push the envelope and and really leave an impression [Music] the new LSD record the collaboration between Diplo and labyrinth and of course SIA has not really left audiences with a lot to imagine going into the cell P given that nearly every track here was released prior as a single and yeah I mean this is very hit-or-miss millennial pop I appreciate that these three came together and tried to artfully weave into one project just about every millennial pop stereotype imaginable from the instrumentals to the singing style to the way these tracks build up to their choruses every stereotype of pop from this past decade or so is like on this record at some point I'm just not sure what to say about it beyond that a couple of tracks from this thing are certainly worth taking away but the entire record I'm just not feeling it what the hell is this I feel like Fat Mike heard logic supermarket was like no way this dude is gonna walk away with worst album of the year I'm gonna make the worst album of the year I'm gonna do it thank you everyone for watching this latest

_wutLZaSZU0,hi everyone know theny sound tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new king gizzard and the lizard wizard album fishing for fishies this is the latest full-length LP from Australian psyche rock wizards king gizzard and the lizard wizard who are fresh off of a well-deserved break at least I hope they took a break after an ambitious effort in 2017 were they released not one not two but five new albums of original material every record had its own style and sound and concept from the microtonal microtonal banana the progressive rock influenced polygon DeWanna land also the collaborative jazzy trippy and somewhat dreamy sketches of Brunswick East I didn't love every project the band put out in this span of time but still very much admired the effort they were putting forward and I was certainly looking forward to hearing how the band would enter the next phase of their career now going into this album I really had no idea what to expect even after having enjoyed a few cuts that tease toward the release of this record I loved the heavy analog synthesizers all over sigh boogie the jaunty jazz rock and harp runs all over the track the birdsong are pretty sweet this is actually one of several moments on the album where harp turns up to create a transitional moment there was the weird playful experimental folk of the title track the incredibly groovy boogie man Sam I really couldn't see where this album was going even though it was staring me right in the face and being the vintage rock historians that King gizzard are of course this album indulges in electric boogie woogie blues with of course some very interesting experiments and variations in the mix yes the sounds of canned heat and little feet and Molly Hatchet as well as ZZ Top are alive and well on this album those electric blues riffs and licks the squawking harmonicas the thumping drum beats all of which served as a rock-solid baseline for king gizzard to throw some very weird ideas on top of the track this thing features some very eerie and persistent jazz chords plays throughout some of the verses also toward the back end of the track the band is suddenly thrusted into this driving krautrock Ian Jam where the harmonica is on the track are dueling with some sci-fi synth melodies it's not one of my favourite tunes on the entire record but I still find the mix of influences seamlessly coming together on this track to be really admirable unfortunately I feel roughly the same way about the track the bird song again like the variety of instrumentation here like the weird influences converging on top of this boogie backdrop but ultimately I find the tune pretty forgettable not so much though for the track plastic boogie where I absolutely love the guitar licks the wild group vocals laid all over the track as well as the lyrics about the destructive nature of plastic waste on our environment the tight and bright stuttering guitars on this track are exhilarating as well as the chaotic rhythm section and to take it back to the tracks I boogie as well as a Korean these song cking gizzard fusing this boogie sound with these thick layers of progressive analog synths pushing the sound into an epic but weird retro futuristic direction I also love the lyrics on the last cut too depicting this depressed cyborg who's fishing for trout in a binary broke psy boogie is also the longest track on this record is 6 minutes and 48 seconds I love the numerous phases the band brings this song through and the way they're able to meld these since in these robot vocals on to this old-school rock groove and in build there are so many weird and unexpected takes and directions that the band takes this boogie sound in and it's just maybe the biggest selling points of this album from the demented and distorted reels not real which features some totally unexpected show tune inspired verses that actually go over very very well then there's the track the cruel Millenial which when it comes to blues rock is much more primped and refined and cleaned up sounds like something that Fleetwood Mac would have recorded back in the day in a lot of ways this track is actually a dead ringer for a Fleetwood Mac song maybe with the exception of the lyrics which are all about not really being able to identify with the technology addiction and love of Battle Royale games and tablet screens that the millennial generation faces it's a little pretentious but there is definitely a vibe coming off of the lyrics here of of why can't I relate so the track is also struggling with these feelings of just being an outsider but my least favorite cut on the entire album easily is the title track itself even though I do identify very directly with the sentiment of the song of just leaving fishies alone letting them be not eating animals and letting them live naturally hey you step shoving your vagin prepper ganders down my throat I can't what I want to eat leave me alone yeah but still I don't care for the tune or the instrumental all that much this just feels like a very annoying piece of weirdo folk that you would get if you force the wiggles to write an experimental psychedelic folk rock song I find the nasally vocals on this thing to be completely annoying the effects laid on top of them too also I don't see how this track works all that well into the Boogie context of the rest of the songs on here sure there are some electric blues embellishments coming out of the guitars on this track and the drumbeat sounds like something that may be in the background of a ZZ Top song but outside of setting the tone for many of the environmentalist and naturalistic themes that run throughout many tracks on this record I don't really feel like this song does all that good a job of kind of setting the table for the rest of these tracks and the sound they bring overall I think this is a very interesting record I think lyrically there's a smart concept to it I think instrumentally and musically there is a smart concept to it sure the execution on a few tracks leaves a lot to be desired or you know just a few songs that I think are really underwhelming still I think King gizzard delivers some of their best material to date and I love that the band is continuing to stay creative stay on the cutting edge and make something old sound new again and essentially just doing things that their contemporaries in the rock genre wouldn't dare to do at this point I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this one Tran have you given this wrecker to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well or over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana King gizzard Oh forever 
hkYvWVA33Ck,"that's what people said that it is first review second worst dislike I've never seen it's got 21,000 dislike damn that's crazy survived that like as were you that's true like it spawn y'all can't see us but it look like half of Fantana look at the way it's Paul's right now like you walking in on some boys this is so old it might 70 yet so yeah so over here for we're gonna do a review of Fanta knows Kanye My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy album review that he did eight years ago and this is like a review that we never got a chance to touch to lose you're starting around this and that's what makes this interesting that's why that's why I thought this would be a cool idea yeah because like I said people were hot about this review so I go we go see what bullshit Fantana says people still bring it up like well and Vitello's do game dark mother's car fantasy six the 16 a light six so yeah I'm interesting where you gonna say about this [Music] because nosey cool dad he says that's not the case the reason it's hard to ignore contacts on this LP is because Kanye's favorite thing to rap about is himself the economy's he wonder what his Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is you see white woman is some alpha this is this is Sena you Athenians everything he likes about him was set up but what was the hook on so pause ridiculous but how was it a bad hmm I got the words sound generic ridiculous come on man you know nation it is fucking ridiculous saying that hook is generic is fucking ridiculous [Music] they were bad he said they were generic in corn I can see him saying all the lights hook may be corny yeah I mean that's like my least favorite song I think is comment about you you have to be interested in Kanye as a person in order to enjoy this album I'm not sure if he would still agree with that now but I don't think that's true at all cuz I definitely didn't know shit about Kanye really like his personal life when this came out remember I told y'all this was the album that really made me interested in Kanye yeah I've heard shit before but I really care nah not at all not at all but this was the one where I was like holy shit and I didn't know any of that shit that he was talking about it didn't matter yeah like I don't have to know what blame game was about I was just like this is a dope-ass song and the what he's talking about the way saying it was cool Kanye's personal life was so at the forefront it was at the time was this mother past yeah and that led to you know 808 when he came out with you know AIT's a lot of I'm gonna say all but like a good majority of like hip-hop fans were just like man what the hell is this like you know like why do you make this a dough a shit and this was kind of like the reburn I guess you like to make up out [Music] or run away but he's not saying they're bad Lisa they're boring though because because they dealt with Kanye's personal life he wasn't interested in Caillou's personal life and somebody's here in Calle wrap about his personal life it becomes boring to him but how do you okay but I don't care about any rappers personal life right but I can still get into the songs and the thing is I never one time even thought about run away being like some deep introspective personal song I just thought he was just talking shit it isn't that kind of stuff like is this story telling you give us an insight my isn't that something you want from from an artist so how is he penalizing him for Telekom's I mean if you're not interested you're not interested but it sounds like he's penalizing for him not being interested this is hilarious I wish Pete I wish he was here because what's funny is now we fast forward eight nine years and that's what people look to Kanye for me is is this personal connection so as I kind of wonder if he's changed his mind at all so after we do his video I would love to see him answer that question and he's changed his mind about this at all [Music] oh I kind of wonder if it's the same shit that that I kind of went through when the Kendrick album came out so I wonder if people were just the butterfly sorry yeah I wonder if people were just harassing him and harassing him and harassing about this album and then we went and checked it out it didn't live up to the harassment so he was just like I don't see the peak and then you add the drama on top of her which probably at that time he didn't care about any of the antics so you know and then that fed into the album right and then it ruined it for minutes that could've probably ruined before cuz I don't really and all outside of you know the other stuff you said towards the end I mean I don't think he'd really say anything I think a lot of people trip over to score I think the score will score yeah yeah I think people would trip over the score because they like man you rate it in their opinion they feel like he's rated higher albums that were way worse than this and they like you get in a six yeah I remember I'll watch it little lo yachty review that she got it because seven or eight oh whatever in a new game our beautiful fantasy a six for this Eliza that's wack so yeah people people downloaded this so this morning one thousand but at the end the thing is it's not a bad rap we picked on shit but it's not a bad review at all I was going to this thing thinking like we was going at this pause like 25 times oh my god what the hell was you thinking none of it yeah like he was gonna say that the rapping was wack the production was well his comments while we're sitting talking score cuz this he was for this record 2010 yeah it's the school like this let's think about this for a second ladies court like yeah yeah because like we looking vibe and I know Mike you really didn't look at the magazine's like that we did sourcing all that but really all image looked at the score we really read the article right you know saying you read the article yeah cuz I know the back then stuff all I did was I gotta see why they rated that album of not only I was bad - yeah but amount of majority I think the majority of people going if looking at magazine because a lot of times you just go go in the store yeah yup good night pick it up and you're just gonna see you how many mics - Scott yeah how many records this guy and I think that's what people normally booty for that body within the reader yeah people that bought the magazine so I can see people doing that but even if I just kind of skim through it in the store I knew what kind of recon look at yours and O'Connor like you may not just be read and pick out enough I'm gonna read this this this comic this was like the first one I scrolled to it I just jumped out at me this is definitely what the issue is so he says this review is like the equivalent of saying a Dark Knight or insert any acclaimed movie had great acting cinematography music directing etc really good movie and it gets a C+ grade so they're not upset with the content of the review there's simply upset with the score oh wow wow here you go look at this this video is living proof that no one actually watches the review I mean everyone just skips to the end for the raid a see what you just said yeah so this is really this is not an tano's fault this is the fault of the people do you put the score in the in the description section I wonder I don't know if he's I don't know if he always did that I think he that's something he didn't put it in the description I did there you go so I bet you people didn't even watch the reviews yeah they just went in the comments are six out of ten so let's do this you know a lot of people hit hit down thumbs down and thumbs up before you've been watching so they will get ya new polarock wow that's really whack that people still bring this up and it's not even a bad with you really a fair review it wasn't fair it was definitely a fair of you it wasn't nothing that just made me be like oh hell with the run of it I hope to run away and she'd say I was born but that's it this is just nuts imagine being this wrong a prime example of Neil drop fans taking the score far more seriously than the review mm-hmm Vala so that is that is so weird to me that people because like I said the reason we wanted to do this one was because none of us had actually watched it yet but I feel like I know for me I can speak for myself I've been meaning to I just never got around to it just because people constantly bring it up like I'll see in his comments they'll be like yeah but you gave Dark Twisted Fantasy yeah go back and watch it but I didn't want to get myself all annoyed because he was saying some crazy right right right but he's not yeah it made it seem like he absolutely trashed out yes and he really didn't he's gonna like five minutes talking pretty favorably about yeah until he got into his critiques which really wasn't I mean that's personal preference right look at this Omar Saeed I can't pronounce his last name is it wrong that I'm still mad about this eight years later yes yes yes did you watch this already no I told you leave them out there let me tell cliff nose like you basically gave a favorable favorable review but the score was like a six so it's almost like like a sit like wait huh so like a light six now you're like a solid Wow so-so but how high is it alright so Kanye West is one of the most influential people of our musical error right how the hell is this person's album dinner six I'll tell you how that happened people and nothing might kind of mentioned earlier I think he was just annoyed with people constantly badgering him to review it over and over again so he thought he was gonna do something like super amazing and the expectation that was said by the fans were about the high volume of people as an employer it didn't match up with what he was hearing at the time I could see how people hyped it up to the point where your expectation level is set extremely high but I don't know how you listened to it and it's a light six I just I don't understand they're like yeah because if the people set the bar at ten and you listen to this and you know taking into account everything you're saying to me and so can't go below in eight you're gonna give a reaction but you're gonna like emotionally down scored because people are hyping else yeah so if somebody told me that something is a 10 out of 10 album and I hear it after being harassed for a week and it's really to me like an 8 out of 10 just because I'm irritated I might drop that shit down to a 6 or it's gonna be petty santa-santa know he was being petty okay so then what about musically then you know who say like like what did he describe in terms of my setting the production was great the sampling was great you some great soul samples I'm telling you score it was many to score I think people were pissed off at this chord nobody's really like yo man what you said here is wrong or what you say here I disagreed nobody said that they're just bitching about the score but do you think the the review itself soon master score though but see that's why I've never agree with doing scores because you get yourself caught up like that you know I'm sure I'm sure Fantana probably doesn't think that little yachties album is better than this he probably does it but says he already gave this a 6 and he gave this a 7 he can't like go back and change this shit so the score is just the score and then my thing too is is like when the scoring system is it is it consistently across every artist that you're judging on that's like it's hot or are you judging the artist by the artist you know say like are you judging Kanye against Kanye to give them a 6 or are you just like are you putting them in the same foot you said a little yadi scored higher than it yeah yeah so you know like is he grading on a curve he's ready on it on a curve necessarily I think is just kind of no matter what you say it was just this project itself is based on the the content that I'm hearing gives this score well you can't really make the score independent of the score because he would have to say that every single video he would have to say this is a six for Kanye meaning meaning in the realm of Kanye this is a mid-ground album exactly lil yachty album is a seven for yachty in the realm of yadi albums is a seven he would have to say that every time true I think that the issue is this was eight years ago so maybe back then he hadn't reconciled how the scoring should go with the content yet and maybe he's getting better with that now but is it true is it his fault that somebody would take a score and use that score and start comparing it to all these other great albums no it's not his fault do you think the fans are justifiable like and not like me because he gave it a six even though he gave it a favorable review not liking the review it so we went to witness to tell you that is got it's got seven thousand likes and 21,000 dislikes they were right in like yeah I'm in the video yeah right yeah so that everybody else does and everybody think it's the fan for so you think it's his fault more so than the fans fault yeah because at the end of the day you've got to be held a cut like you didn't want to came up with the rating system mmm you know I'm saying you're the one that named that rating in a sense not the people so people are just digesting the rating system uh and and that rating doesn't equal it's not it's it's not what that album is you're at the very least I don't care if you're a hip hop head aficionado like you listen to country and I just play this album for the first time in your life this is a eight or better you know saying hi I just I don't see how you can really know that even though it's a favorable favorable review mm-hmm because he gave it a six you with the fans on this time with the fans on this one say the same thing want to like or dislike videos but if I was I would this is my is Maddie is barely it's not even a sea dog chick like yeah girl you beautiful you know sad ever gonna know yeah but you but you know like TC gonna yesterday now she would look at even look at you like your eyes exactly you not gonna talk that has no more that was the last time you can't text her you can't call her you know man catching murder you could wander down there all night up what could have winding down there all night but the thing is that you watched it and there's a I mean we don't happen there's no way we would actually know but come on man we think that a lot of people just saw the score and didn't watch it mm-hmm so and that's where fast worded to the end to see what he scored a nice is in his description but his description so you made that content they're judging it based on but but but he's saying that if he watched it and he gave it a favorable review and a low score he would he would just like that's fair the people that didn't watch it we don't know but now if they did it they're all just like oh and the YouTube community is a whole different animal and the only reason why we know that is because we've been doing this show like close to 10 years - so sorry so I understand it from that perspective but out of that twenty one thousand about 12 to 13 thousand of the motherfuckers violent break nothing niggas is valid what he was saying Missy about the album itself you know a couple things here that kind of maybe like but for the most part I was I thought he was pretty fair to be I almost expect him to be like just like how I used how I go ham more albums and I don't like I'm thinking he was gonna be doing shit like that mm-hm but he was so how can you like be okay with that then because because his his rating the album is part of the review and it shit don't match so I can't be okay with that dislike [Laughter] no no but you can't give them that pass generated in a sense that's part of the review and I guess I'm looking at like that why people have been going so crazy about about this Amber view because I'm thinking he's what's gonna be going saying I'm going don't mess up it's the match part that people treasure it's part of like life you folks a just a part of the well you can't be like oh a business like this right somebody said again like it's great everything was beautiful about it any grace to the two you still feel that way I mean that's this extreme but that's what I'm saying but like it's like it bad a matters it matters the misreading matters this part of his my 200 would have been like what is extreme by the fact that he put it as his second best our man is discography if this is a second so what you're saying is number one so the number one is just a second and we talked about Kanye 100% that's what we do we don't wreck shit so would you is like you don't fucking matter anyway but it's a part of his system though exactly so you can you can see not great and what he do that that review was a was a light for [Music] I think is more of the fans I think it's more than fans than Fantana I think big stone being on YouTube for a while and how people are I think people are reacting to reading a score and not listening to what he said so if somebody said yeah if it was writing us against reviewers and they said man did a hip hop it's great I'm gonna have to put him at number 10 unless you're cool with that connecting today that's what people gonna look at the ranking away ranked us that's my favorite shit on YouTube but yeah man I like like 40 motherfuckers better the vitriol that he's experienced are coming from people that don't watch the reviews it's 700 that the opposite but the odds are in our favor those 700 7,000 necessarily I agree totally the King now people were putting in the comment section Fantana I don't understand how you all of these really intelligent things and positive things and then you gave it a 6 I'm confused I would get their confusion what I don't get is the anger the anger is what tells me that they didn't watch it I don't feel like after watching that review it provokes anger I feel like it might provoke confusion so that's the difference only that I can blame Fantana for is don't put the score in the put that show at the end of the video people are still gonna skip to the end without watching but I just wouldn't put the score in the actual description section I think that's where he messed up but at the end of the day I don't really think it's bad deed he gave the shit a good review people are just mad because after that they couldn't reconcile that 6 with later Ace or later sevens and that's the part that they're fucked up on after that soliloquy Mike just gave like III get where he's saying that if you're angry mm-hmm then you didn't watch it mmm because you're just solely reacting to the number mm-hmm because the number is disrespectful it is disrespectful for parties to me you don't six like that's just disrespectful so I get if you're angry you probably didn't watch it but if you're confused like me then that means that you have sense and you watch it and when you're questioning how are you saying all this blowing shit but then it's a six like because it just don't add up right so I get that that's fair first first and foremost one of the things that I'm most proud of is that in studios ATL make sure you file that hi G M and N in hip-hop you know we've been robbed or phantom for a minute any time we could do a collab or hijack his channel it's always welcome we'll do it for the whole month if he gave us the keys to that but all yeah man check us out at fee for 24/7 mics e-town kb inch B 0 xxx don't forget the man behind the camera - media and we [Music] you "

sOBAdKipu4c,"ha ha ha one Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd in this video I'm going to have a discussion with you but not really with you because I'm talking at you through YouTube and you can't talk back at me but still I'm going to have a conversation with you about the significance of album art and how it impacts our perception of the album's themselves now believe wow AG I am the cow man look at me oh boy do I love the pretty pictures on the music boxes kahlert are you feeling okay something seems off I'm feeling rather dandy right is the brain okay I mean fine but I'm pretty sure you're not Cal wait isn't already Tuesday I think I'm going to throw up okay look at the time it's time to go bye bye bye bye time to go now that the sad man is gone it's time to get glad and make with the music let's get this show on hit it cow all right that's me [Music] welcome now explained the show where I explain art my name is Michele and sex drugs and the rocking and the roll that's the life for me yes sir I sure you like the way music makes me feel it's got that rhythm that keeps this old girl going and what does music good form if not bringing people together sometimes you don't even need to listen to music to be offended or aroused today we're discussing some of the most controversial album art works first on this list of album artworks that you mean I wanna show Momo and Papa is Kanye West My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy this is Kanye West's fifth studio album released in 2010 with featured guts that included jay-z Nicki Minaj Pusha T and Kid Cudi and many other artists that were pretty good but not good enough to be included in this sentence that has already gone on for far too long while a game-changer in Kanye's career that received a nearly perfect review score on Metacritic there was still some retailers that refused to carry the album because of its cover art despite this banning the album sold nearly 500,000 copies in its first week going straight to the top of the charts according to The New Yorker this artwork was created by award-winning New York City based contemporary artist George Kondo his works have been featured in the MoMA and the National Gallery of Art and he has lectured at the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum the new Museum Columbia University and Yale versity he was even an assistant at Andy Warhol's factory and friends with Keith Haring he also has a bit of a sense of humor I mean have you ever seen Queen Elizabeth look so funny look at that face when he was commissioned to create an artwork for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy Kanye said that he wanted an image that would get banned but Universal Music Group's Def Jam wasn't in total agreement with us the LA Times reported that West was strongly urged to use alternate art but was told if he wanted to do it the label would stand behind him in an interview with vulture Conda described the painting saying she's a kind of fragment between his Fink's a Phoenix a haunting ghost a harpy and then Kanye is also in some sort of strange 1970s burned-out back room of Chicago Blues Club having a beer so far away from the real kanye west that it's just a scream on how Conda responded to people who are offended by his painting it didn't seem like he cared he said the superimposition of people's perceptions on a cartoon is shocking what's happening in their minds should be banned not the painting despite the hubbub about the explicit sexual content and the nudity billboard still named it one of the best album covers ever created I miss the days when the most appalling thing Kanye did was to picked himself going kina Sphynx Wow Kanye very edgy proud of you if you think that Kanye album wasn't so bad well you're right that was just a warm-up and it's going to get a whole lot worse than abstract interspecies sex carcasses covered for a reek of petrifaction is a sort of macabre lodge of gruesome images all of which were taken from real autopsy photographs from medical journals it looks sort of cute in an ending Jeffrey Dahmer sort of way especially if you squint your eyes bill steer the guitarist and founding member of the grindcore band said of the album I guess we wanted to cause some friction part of it was that teenage thing where it's fun to offend but there is also this streak of humor running through it John Peel co-author of choosing death the improbable history of death metal and grindcore found that part of the appeal of the album with the cover art he said that these grisly photos complemented the tracks on the album including gems like vomited anal tract and manifestation of varicose urethra this is not an artist's rendering or interpretation these are real once living deceased human beings on the cover this aspect of it can understandably be seen as crossing the line bands like cannibal corpse for example have their share of grotesque terrifying horrific album covers but they are clearly fake and not even photorealistic on top of that carcass like cannibal corpse is not necessarily making a grand meaningful statement they're just having fun and in a dark way trying to be humorous whether that's okay or not is well what do you think golly gee willikers if I'm still in here then who's in there my fear and anguish grow please oh please mister let me back in we are the young and the young the peas in the air pod bonhart and Clydesdale oh no wait don't change the channel speaking of terrifying horrifying gruesome things let's talk about the Beatles The Beatles yesterday and today today the Beatles are known for having a relatively wholesome reputation but believe it or not there is a time where they were deemed a little too edgy back in 1966 the album cover for the Beatles yesterday and today was quite the controversy here on the album cover the Fab Four depicted wearing white butchers coats full covered in dismembered baby doll parts and meat from the get-go music critics and others who are sent advanced copies of the album were offended and disturbed by the time they reached stores many were recalled and thrown away so what were they getting at here was it a Kanye asked provocation for provocation sake sort of situation or did they have a perverted dark sense of humor like the members of carcass Robert Whittaker the 26 year old Australian photographer who took the photo for the album cover said I got fed up with taking squeaky clean pictures of the Beatles and I thought I'd revolutionised with pop vinyls our John Lennon said of the artwork if the world can accept something as cruel as the war they can accept this cover afterwards Whitaker went on to photograph the likes of Salvador Dali cream and Mick Jagger he even wrote a book about the experience called the unseen Beatles released in 1991 the effort to recall copies of this heinous cover was called Operation retrieved by Capitol Records while some are simply given new sleeves destroyed or thrown away they experimented with others and had covers pasted over with a different photo ultimately it was the massive failure financially an operation retrieved cost them over $200,000 it is still the only Beatles album to ever lose money for Capitol Records more recently copies of this album that the original artwork have sold for upwards of $125,000 and are very difficult to find while is impossible to prove that this was their true intention I believe that this is an admirable attempt for them to bring attention to the horrors of the Vietnam War and the unnecessary suffering that it caused for so many they were able to make an edgy artwork that was extremely out there for the time but there is purpose behind it I'll always be able to get behind any artist who is taking risks potentially at the expense of losing fans or hurting their own reputation in order to make a meaningful statement thanks bug voice Dead Kennedys Franken Christ Franken Christ is the third album by hardcore punk band Dead Kennedys released in 1985 the cover itself is rather mild it's a Pyxis Shriners parade with members driving miniature cars but it was a poster included in the record sleeve that truly caused this album to turn this frog 360 degrees the posters titled landscape number xx but it is also known as penis landscape it is a 1973 artwork by Swiss painter H R Giger and depicts rows of capiz and bull Dino's Gieger is known for having been a part of the Academy award-winning special effects team behind the film alien in 1986 one year after the album was released police officers raided the label alternative tentacles as well as the home of Dead Kennedys lead singer and songwriter Jello Biafra the actual was done in response to complaints by the parents music Resource Center whose mission at the time was to increase parental control on music that may have had adult themes in the 1989 spoken word album high priest of harmful modern tales from the trial Biafra summarized the whole experience in approximately 45 minutes here's a quick word from him on what it was like from the beginning so I find out that what it takes nine cops to tear my whole house apart to find record album Franken Christ buy my old band Dead Kennedys and inside that record album was a painting by Swiss surrealist master H R Giger they really wanted his ass I mean one of the one of the elegant it was going where's the guy did this painting where is he worthy he's in Switzerland with the accusation that be opted for a distributed harmful material to minors he faced a possible sentencing of one year in jail and a $2,000 fine to help pay for his legal fees a punk-rock benefit concert was hosted and then no more censorship defence fund was created for fans and free speech advocates to donate to the band in the label the following trial almost drove the label alternative tentacles to bankruptcy luckily the charges against the album's distribution team were dropped due to lack of evidence eventually the trial against the band and label ended due to a hung jury with a vote of 7 to 5 in favor of acquittal in 2005 NPR's This American Life interviewed Los Angeles prosecutor Michael Guarino who tried to make a name for himself by taking the Dead Kennedys to court well all throughout the trial we were seeing various anchors kind of smirking at the fact that we were doing this that was unusual that was different I hadn't experienced that yet I did start to think that I was on not the wrong side of the case so much but more generally the wrong side of history after the trial the eager painting was no longer included in the record except by mail order from alternative tentacles with proof of age even so years later the press continued to discuss the ethics of the album while the Dead Kennedys album Franken Christ ended up going down as one of the most famous freedom of speech' cases ever from the punk rock genre it's also a tiny bit of a disappointment because it's more often known for the emotional and tall in the band while the album songs talk about dictatorships war and blind hatred these lyrical themes are rarely discussed in comparison in music censorship and free speech these are still important to discuss but I worried that the main point of the album may have been overshadowed by the art in the end Eagers painting was powerful enough to wipe out any discussions not revolved around obscenity I guess I want to say a few words he started off as a kind of hackneyed parody but as I got to know you he became one palatable like the son I never had and we had a deep deep deep father-son bond for that I want to thank you Oh Deary me I still have meat on the bones I have to tell them that I'm still kicking I think there's been a bit of a mix-up PC hello oh wait mayhem the dawn of the black hearts in Norway's black metal scene the normal rules of human decency don't apply the kinds of one-upmanship as to who can be the most brutal or metal lovingly parodied and cult hit shows like Metalocalypse comes from a real place mayhem is one of the most controversial metal bands of all time maybe the most this is exemplified to the utmost degree with Mayhem's album cover for the dawn of the black hearts distastefully after main homes lead singer perylene otherwise known by the pseudonym dead took his own life in 1991 the band's guitar player known by the stage name Euronymous took a photo of the scene and decided to grace the cover of their next album you have to admit by Norwegian black metal standards it's maybe I guess the most metal thing you could do to be clear this was an official album artwork but it was used for a live who like album released by war master records even so goddamn to take this even further this is real your honor misused pieces of dead skull to create necklaces for the remaining members of the band one of these skull fragments sold for $3,500 years later to quote your on amiss from an excerpt of black metal evolution of the cult it's not every day you get the chance to see and touch the real corpse and it's important to learn one thing when you are dealing with the dark side there is nothing which is too sick evil or perverted this man has even allegedly made comments that he considered eating parts of dead sprained what the fuck just wait the plot thickens in an interview in The Guardian one of the founding members of the band known as necro butcher claimed that euronymous would often encourage dead to kill himself some believe that taking this photo was a strange way for euronymous to deal with his death but to others it sounded like another way for the band to gain notoriety which is something he did non-stop throughout his career necro butcher cut all ties with Joran amidst after he made this decision seriously though please understand that suicide is never a solution to a problem your family and friends loved you you're worth it if you're feeling this way please call the National Suicide Prevention lifeline poor way to judge and say that one album cover is artistic genius and the other is just a provocateur trying to get a reaction does it matter either way where's the line these same questions can be asked for many album covers and pieces of art out there in the world listening to others and at least being apathetic if you don't agree is paramount show some respect unless you don't like that cover to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy what's wrong with you regardless proceed with caution if you look up any of these albums especially at work because they are spicy Bunch if you want to see more arts plenary type videos check out our explained on downhill media we love you [Music] "
iyn8OzmUjuA,what's up everybody I'm Finn Mackenzie you may know me from my channel the punk rock MBA I'm the Internet's second busiest music nerd and today I'm going to talk to you about my very favorite topic metalcore specifically a handful of metalcore gems that I think have gotten maybe lost in the cracks a little bit some underappreciated metalcore gems that I love and I hope you'll love too now if you are watching this video then you probably already know about converge and botch and all that kind of stuff I'm not gonna waste your time telling you out stuff you already know about I am here to give you the deep cuts or at least kind of deep cuts and if you like this video or any of the stuff I recommend in this video then of course I would love it if you subscribe to my channel it again it's called the punk rock MBA in with that out of the way let's get into it number one and theage n by blood let now for those of you who don't know me which is most of you I'm guessing I grew up in the 90s hardcore scene and these guys were one of the most interesting bands from that whole scene one of my favorite bands and unfortunately even though they were kind of big back then they seem to have been sort of forgotten by the 90s hardcore history books I don't know why I guess if I was gonna compare it to anything I would say maybe like the really early metalcore stuff like overcast and stark weather with maybe a dash of the discordant weirdness of dead guy and neurosis they've got a few things in their discography but entheogen is the one that I would suggest you listen to if you've already heard that and you want more I would check out eclectic that's the album that collects all their early 7 inches and demos I think that's pretty good too but entheogen and my opinion is their finest moment and if I had to pick one song my suggested song off that album would be brainchild number two is headspace by issues so switching gears from the 90s to today these guys are hands-down my favorite band of this whole generation of metalcore as the kids say there's levels to this shit and issues is ten levels ahead of absolutely everybody else in the genre they kind of jokingly call themselves jazz like DJ az gent plus jazz and that's pretty dumb but it's actually kind of accurate I kind of think of it as like what if tower of power played eight string guitars because honestly if you took a tower of power song and like rearranged it for like a Ghent ensemble that's really what you would get there drawing much more from like jazz funk R&B hip-hop that kind of thing then they are like the standard metalcore playbook the song I would suggest is called the realest it's the first song off of headspace but this should have a new single out by the time you watch this video so check that out too number three is fury and the fallen ones by the ghost inside my wife calls these guys hardcore core because they're not exactly hardcore but they're not exactly metalcore either if metalcore is metal plus hardcore the ghost inside is like hardcore Plus metalcore which would make them hardcore core right anyway as far as the sound I would say like think of it as if terror had been listening to a bunch of Killswitch Engage before they wrote their next album which also makes them the perfect transition band for metalcore kids who are leaving their scene phase and entering their real hardcore phase the next step is simple by the entire trip will be records catalog and hope nobody notices your was me tattoo anyway it might sound like I'm making fun of the band I am totally not in all seriousness I legitimately love this band especially this album all their albums are great but this is my personal favorite I think it's also the most underappreciated and if you were going to listen to one song in there my suggestion is the song the lion war next up number four are you serious by dead to fall now these guys were one of the first bands to do the whole like mellow death inspired death Corps metalcore kind of thing their first album came out in 2002 they had another one that came out in 2004 and both those are excellent they're like a somewhat less death 'mentally version of the black dahlia murder I would say but the album that in my opinion is their real masterpiece is their final album are you serious this is the album where they went from being like pretty good or very good even to being absolutely amazing and totally awesome I don't really know how to put it it's kind of odd and if anybody in the band is watching this I would love to know what the deal is to me like their first two albums are pretty standard like serious metalcore stuff in terms of tone and then all of a sudden like a switch flipped and they're just like fuck this shit I'm fucking over it let's just make our next album a ridiculous sarcastic joke at least that's the only way that I can explain the name of this album this ridiculous deliberately awful cover art and lyrics like these we got to get the kids moving circle pitting and singing along got a really original idea of how I think we should in this song let's in the song with a fucking breakdown amazing right like basically what they did is they made a great metalcore album about how stupid metalcore is if you're into that like technical deathcore kind of sound like animosity then you will probably like this album my suggested song for this album is the song stupid an album number five the world of hatred EP by demolisher okay now I will admit that maybe this band is a little too heavy to be called metalcore maybe the better label for them would be deathcore but listen I can't miss the opportunity to come on the needle drop and talk about what I think might be the single most underappreciated band of the whole like late myspace generation and in my opinion the pioneers of that whole like super ridiculously heavy like caveman downtempo beat down thing that bands like burials and Kublai Khan and black tongue and Body Snatcher are doing now in my opinion these guys kind of really set the template for that and me personally I don't think that anybody is ever going to do it better than this EP that they put out in 2009 this my friends is the Sistine Chapel of downtempo beat down and this is so underappreciated that it actually isn't on Spotify but it is on Bandcamp so check it out and my suggested song from this EP is decimated but you really can't go wrong with any of them and number six is the self-titled album by VOD also known as vision of disorder I guess depending on who you ask now if you're not familiar with these guys they're one of the biggest Long Island hardcore bands of the 90s which had an amazing hardcore scene back then and they're rightly credited as one of the pioneers of metalcore and whether you like it or not they're definitely the band that put the whole like screamed verse with clean singing chorus thing on the map they were if not the very first to do that there were definitely the first to do it and get any kind of traction for it so if you like that you can write them a thank-you letter if you hate it well then I guess you know who blamed for it and of course poison the well a couple years later and when I hear these guys brought up these days it's most often their second album imprint that people are talking about and that album is definitely their most noisy heavy raw one it's kind of a botched dead guy coalesced kind of thing it's a great album me wrong but to me their first album or as we used to call it the green slime album because of the Nickelodeon double dare green slime on the cover in my opinion that is the album that stands out most to me which could possibly be my old man nostalgia rose-colored glasses it's definitely very 90s sometimes almost kind of veering into nu-metal territory but there's just really nothing else like it I've never heard anything before or since that sounded like that album the song I would suggest you check out is XS in number 7 I think I'm kind of losing count hopefully I got that right is Genesis by what was mean if you're in your 20s you may remember this band from blowing up on MySpace back in like 2009 or 2010 on the back of all their Katy Perry covers and then they had 9 million member changes and broke up and they went through like 25 members in two years or something when it comes to that like totally over produced super fake late 2010 metalcore style this is as good as it gets my friend Jesse calls this stuff thx core because it kind of sounds more like a movie trailer than it does like a live band [Music] it's so over the top like so edited so sample replaced so produced and I love all of it like if you've ever heard an actual drum set being played by a human you will recognize that the sounds on this album that are supposed to be drums are very clearly not a drum set but who cares because this album slaps this is top-shelf late 2010's metalcore with the big chunky breakdowns the giant clean singing like almost pop punk kind of choruses if you ever wanted to hop into the time machine and go back to the days of neon cartoon monster merchants and swoopy haircuts well I can't help you I don't think that exists but if you fire up this album and might be the next best thing my suggested song in this album is story to tell and I think we're on number eight now which is disgusting by Beartooth and you might be saying wait a minute what is Beartooth their analysts have underappreciated bands they have a million listeners on Spotify and their last album was number one on the US indie charts and you're right but the reason I'm bringing them up in this video is because I think their first album is a little bit slept on don't get me wrong the new stuff is great but disgusting is an amazing unique album in I'm gonna use every opportunity I can to talk it up it's kind of hard to categorize it because really there's nothing else like it it alternates between this like really nasty grimy pissed-off hardcore that almost sounds like something Kurt Bloo would do and then these like big huge hooky pop choruses that sound like something from a Demi Lovato song and somehow it all just kind of works because Caleb is one of those freakishly talented people that can pull that kind of shit off whole album is great but my suggested song would be beaten in lips and lastly number nine is perfect war forever by glass cloud these guys are the epitome of one of those weird situations where a band was really good got signed to a legit label EBR in this case but somehow still never really got any traction and then just kind of broke up without anybody noticing which is really too bad because I think as far as that whole cohort of bands that do the like ridiculously heavy 8 or 9 string thing where like everything in the band has turned into a percussion instrument the whole like post Meshuga thing I guess basically you can call it I think glass cloud does it as well as its ever been done so if you're into bands like the Acacia Strain or varial Zoar the newer mirror stuff and I mentioned a mirror because the drummer guitarist in glass cloud are now in a mirror then you definitely want to check this out the song I would recommend is called trapped like rats alright friends there you go those are my 9 under appreciated metalcore gems like I said hopefully you will find at least one thing you like on that list just all I ask is that you give it a fair shot and if you liked this video or you liked any of the stuff that I've recommended check my channel out it's called the punk rock MBA and of course thank you very much to Anthony for having me on and I'm out 
OwGlrL0gs38,between 1981 and 2018 345 rap songs made it into the top ten at one point or another notice how rap has these enormous swings at popularity of the 48 songs that got a top 10 listing in 2014 only three were rap songs bang bang and a Condon don't tell him but in 2018 there was an explosion of rap and suddenly there were 38 rap songs in the top 10 2018 featured more rap than any year ever but it's no surprise to you the different genres go in and out of popularity and the easy explanation of that would just be to say that it's whatever's hot or whatever's poppin or whatever but I want to figure out why what's hot is hot so I pulled the data and crunch the numbers and we're gonna talk about the reasons for the up-and-down popularity of rap music I'm Cooper send me the pops I'm professor I have my own channel where I explain song lyrics and teach people how to write them and anthony invited me to share a video with you guys while he's out on tour and i know this isn't an album review or a discussion of recent releases it's more a video essay and I'm grateful that I get to share what I found with you hopefully I helped you to put your understanding of new rap albums in a social context while you watched future videos from Anthony when we look at the number of rap songs that made it into the top 10 we immediately notice an upward trend since the late 80s there's a clear line through the data that shows us raps place in the top 10 has been growing at about three-quarters of a song per year and since an average of 56 songs making the top 10 every year in 2061 mathematically the only thing on the radio will be rap music I'm just kidding but the point is that rap music is growing quickly in mainstream popularity which probably doesn't need to be said since it made up 59% of popular music in 2018 but there have also been times that rap was really unpopular it fluctuates so let's start at the beginning rap was born in the 1970s and 1979 through 1986 was a great time for old-school hip-hop but it was still young Jean RAM and wasn't popular in the mainstream which is probably a good thing because if it had gone to the charts right away it might have solidified and not had the chance to grow and develop when Rakim and Big Daddy Kane started dropping music in the mid 80s they changed up the flow and added way more rhyming proving that hip-hop could have a lot more variety both in style and subject matter and ushering in the first Golden Age of hip-hop 1986 through 99 roughly interestingly if we look at our data the first year to include significant amounts of hip-hop in the top 10 was 1989 with four songs including Wild Thing and funky cold Medina the hard work of a lot of different MCS had paid off a previously vibrant but stylistically monolithic genre had been noticed by the mainstream for its ability to innovate and do some pretty interesting things I think this made it more viable for the mainstream and by the mid 90s hip-hop was a small but important John rrah on the charts after that rap kept growing into the late 90s with artists like Will Smith biggie Tupac Puff Daddy and Busta Rhymes until 2000 when it almost disappeared from the charts now no one actually knows why hip-hop lolled but consider what was happening at the time from 1994 to 1997 we experienced the heat of the West Coast and East Coast rap rivalry but in 1996 Tupac was killed and in 1997 the notorious b.i.g was assassinated these two were the respective leaders of the West and East Coast sounds and I think the mainstream void in hip-hop could have been caused not only by their absences from the charts but also from the rivalry dying out things always get more attention when there's conflict and with no rivalry the mainstream seems to have turned his attention elsewhere it didn't take long though from 2000 to 2003 rap went from three songs in the top ten to around 20 where it stayed steady until 2012 well not a golden age in the same innovative way the late 80s were it was a golden age of popularity as rap regularly took control of 25 to 35 percent of the top ten whereas it had only controlled 14 to 18 percent in the 90s so what caused it to take up stronger than ever well of all the things happening around then I think perhaps the two most interesting events were the Rises of two artists in particular jay-z and Eminem jay-z was close friends with the notorious b.i.g and carried on the legacy of East Coast rap eventually making a name for himself his first album dropped in 1996 and he dropped an album every year after until 2003 which in terms of strategy of taking advantage of the void left by the greats couldn't have worked out better for him his prolific workout that can establish down made it hard for him not to become rap icon but grabs the biggest shock and hip-hop history up to that point was a white emcee from Detroit making it big Eminem released the Slim Shady LP in 1999 in the Marshall Mathers LP in 2000 which affected the hip-hop game in two waves first while Eminem wasn't the first by rapper to break the top ten he was the first to see huge mainstream success becoming the highest selling artist since Elvis Presley making a white rapper a rap icon second his intense rhyming and unique flows changed the game for rappers in fact in his 2003 book there's a god on the Mike MC kool Moe Dee claims that while melly-mel Rakim and Biggie all took their turns influencing the flow of generations of rappers Eminem took over in 2003 and while he wasn't the first rapper to be angry or to use complicated rhyme schemes when you combine all that with Eminem being white that's a pretty huge anomaly you may be familiar with the Elvis effect danch artist talks about it in relation to Eminem in his book the big payback basically it describes when a member of the mainstream culture appropriate sack ultra artifact from a subculture to give it mainstream appeal although Elvis was primarily a rock and roll singer before him in the sixties Sol was a facet of black culture after Elvis a white guy did it well all the white people hopped on board too people have a tendency to pay more attention to people like themselves so after Eminem rapping became something that white guys would buy into more because a white guy was modeling it the overall effect of jay-z and Eminem's influence was to skyrocket the popularity of rap into the mid 2000s after they jump-started it artists like 50 cent Kanye West Ludacris Lil Wayne and the Black Eyed Peas carried the baton into the mid 2010 where raps mainstream popularity apparently died again it was a slow decline from 2009 to 2014 no dramatic changes just fewer and fewer top-ten rap songs each year I like to think that the reason here was that rap was getting a to commodified the rap on top 40 radio wasn't staying true to its roots and a lot of artists didn't have anything to say so more rap just meant more of the same like a lot of trends it's spiked and as people got tired of hearing the same thing it petered out to make room for artists like Taylor Swift Katy or Justin Bieber but the lesson popularity I think gave the chance for rebirth the like of which we hadn't seen since the 80s or the early 2000s because while we only had an average of 6.2 rap songs in the top 10 every year from 2012 to 2016 2018 exploded to 38 the most rap songs in the top 10 of any year it's gonna be years before we understand the rebirth of rap into the mainstream but to theorize for now I took a look at the songs in 2018 and found two central themes mumble rap and Drake 24% of the songs in the top 10 shared strong features with mumble rap genre and 26% of songs in the top 10 were bi or featured Drake now drinks certainly set the example for rappers to talk about more personal emotional issues becoming kind of the de facto leader of the conscious rap movement and as a person who appeals to almost all demographics he did what Eminem did for hip-hop even more effectively his music has influenced his persona all contributed to the recent rebirth but while Drake a huge influence it's impossible to say that just one thing caused this resurgence and I wonder whether the most important factor might have been mumble rap a lot of people credit future with inventing it on his track Tony Montana but it took a few years for it to catch on to the mainstream it wasn't until 2016 that a true mumble rap song made it into the top 10 with designers panda coincidentally the very next year rap overall showed up in the top ten a hundred and twenty five percent more I'm not saying that mumble raps saved hip hop from decline and started another golden era of rap but we have to recognize the fact that it at least seems to be one of the factors that helped jumpstart this new popularity there were a lot of factors Drake streaming SoundCloud but mumble raps seems to have done what the East Coast West Coast rivalry did for rap music in the 90s it created conflict between people who hated it in people who loved it creating a need for listeners to stake their claims to the kinds of music they did or didn't support and maybe in some way this helped cause the resurgence of rap into the popular conscience and mainstream music for yet another golden age of popularity obviously a lot of this is theory and my own personal ideas but this is a conversation worth having as we try to understand mu culture the nature of popularity and it's a conversation that I'd like to keep having with you you can check out my channel the pop science professor over there I've got a video that mathematically with the help of Anthony tries to answer the question whether rap lyrics have gotten dumber I've also got a video that uses 32mm songs to try to understand how he writes lyrics and thanks for letting me be here Anthony and viewers it's a huge privilege and an honor and hope that you guys have a great day 
iSJf5PJUrug,oh ho ho hi everyone social capital Gator here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for another edition of great albums where I go over a series of records from the past month or so that I thought were great that I thought were fantastic that I think are worth your time I don't want them to slip through the cracks on you okay links to reviews and sounds from all the albums discussed in this video down below let's go first off I do want to give a shout out to the new immaculate exciting ambitious over-the-top new Beyonce live record homecoming a pretty incredible feat for a live recording not only because of you fantastically tight medley of songs spanning the entire Beyonce discography in this record but also the horns the drum line all the extra instrumentation Beyonce vocally is on point a lot of the time the amount of material on this thing this is a 90 plus minute live set it is just so gargantuan and thrilling and fun even those I think up until this point have never been huge huge huge Beyonce fans I don't think you can walk away from this recording not seeing the the merit in it not hearing the thrill of the performance on this thing sure the mix on this record is a little wonky er than I would like to be but I think a lot of the great qualities of the performance here still translate so please again do not let this one slip past you next record I enjoyed quite a bit over the past month is the new collaborative record between Billy woods and Kenny Siegel hiding-places is the name of this new one Kenny's production throughout this record is totally on point Billy is as dark and as cryptic as ever I would actually say after listening to him for quite a while a lot of the bars and situations dark humor expressed on this record did make me kind of concerned for his well-being but still he actually did like put in a lot of work into the lyrics on this record I can certainly tell some of his best verses to date some of his most thrilling to date I don't think it's as strong hook wise and structurally as some of his other solo material out there and I certainly do enjoy the new Armand Hammer record more than what he's offered here but still another very solid offering from Billy who at this point I think as far as underground MCS go on the East Coast one of the most consistent rappers and lyricists working today period next I want to give a shout out put some focus on the new lizzo record cuz I love you this album is fantastic it's fun it's catchy it's vibrant it's funny its charismatic its magnetic I don't have any more nice adjectives but seriously I love the production on this thing generally Liz owes vocal performances are amazing and electrifying and incredibly entertaining a lot of the songs on this thing comes through with some great topical focuses and um yeah I'm not sure what else to say about this other than its it's very tight it is poppin there is a fun blend of sounds and influences ranging from soul to pop to hip hop just a really fun listen just a very fun listen moving on from there what I think is easily one of the better pop punk records of the decade it's the new pup record more of its stuff the band's best songwriting to date love the dark and somewhat tongue-in-cheek lyrics throughout this record love the very energetic pop punk performances the tunes at the core of all these songs are pretty solid productions kinda rough but given the punk roots of this album its kind of understandable or forgivable if cheeky bittersweet energetic pop punk is your thing you are not gonna want to miss this one next I want to shout out one of my favorite albums of the year so far definitely in my top 5 at this moment for 2019 and that is the new wise blood record titanic rising fantastically produced written and sung chamber pop and art pop record with kind of a vintage veneer on it there's not really thing about this record I don't love the vocals for this particular genre I think are maybe a little dime a dozen kind of to be expected but even that works to the album's benefit in some respects as wise blood also pulls off some very beautiful background vocals on this record - just great vocal layers throughout on this album the compositions the instrumental layering the production from Jonathan Rado of foxes and Fame yes I'm just incredibly enamored with what has been offered here on this album this is really my first time loving wise Bloods music and and that's also because of the big change of style that she's offered on this album it's just so god damn good uh it's beautiful it's catchy it's fun touch touches the heart touch it sits over here touches the heart here and I want to end it off by giving a shout out to the new quali Chris record guns Detroit rapper and producer quali Chris he is back with a new record easily his most socially aware politically charged album yet loads of commentary on our current state as a country as a society on this thing obviously the topic of guns comes up on this record but as do the prison system racism inequality and a whole host of other issues but this is not a super boring drab preachy album or anything like that it's still a quite like Chris record and everything Chris has done up until this point typically has an element of comedy to it it's a little quirky it's a little weird the production on this thing is strange even if there are a few cuts here and there that are a bit more lush and jazzy and somber still vast majority of the beats kind of off-the-wall Chris's flow is nasally and cartoonish a lot of his lyrics point out the absurdity the hilarious absurdity the dark comedy in a lot of issues and problems facing our society today that to me is guns in a nutshell and what makes the record so good and so compelling and that is going to be it for this great albums video all of those records again linked down below do not miss out on them I think they're all incredibly good and yeah I will see you guys in the next video transition have you given any of these albums a listen if you haven't you should and let me know down in the comments did you love him did you hate him what would you rate him you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana great albums of forever 
6dLOzNKfslQ,okay hi everyone ready nice striped Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new collaborative Rico nasty and Kenny beats Project anger management when it's come to the explosion of hyper-aggressive soundcloud rap distorted bump beats screaming on top of them few voices have stood out as boldly as Rico nasties and I would say her uncompromising personality has the potential to make her bigger than the trend itself I mean she's already outlasting it at this point and before this review before this record I already had this feeling that Rico nasty at this point has nowhere to go but up even if her breakthrough project last year nasty was a little one-dimensional it was unique it was aggressive it was in your face but there were still some aspects of it that felt like Rika was still just in the middle of this period of evolution and honestly it wasn't really that long ago where Rico was Auto crooning over some very smooth glitzy and glamorous trap beats on her sugar trap to mixtape the transition from this to singles like trust issues and rage is actually incredible and I think it'd be foolish to assume that this is just where Rico is going to stop because she's got a bit of popularity so with Rico's future projects I'm pretty excited to hear something with more variety and with her new project over here bringing Kenney beats on to basically take part in every track on this thing given that he is such a talented producer can only be a positive however anger management is hardly the sound of Rico building up or taking a huge next step in my opinion it feels more like a quick EP just meant to hold the fans over for maybe something more substantive down the road it's really hard to tell at this point given the unorthodoxy of the rap landscape that Rico nasty comes from compiled with the fact that streaming in a lot of respects has totally torn down the expectations of what a proper album length is at this point given anger management's nine tracks in nineteen minutes I can't also help but feel like there's an element of pressure for Rico nasty to continue striking while the iron is hot as she is thriving in a landscape of over saturation so as a result of its brevity yeah there's not a whole lot to anger management I'll say there's definitely more emotional versatility to this project as the tracklist front loads a ton of bangers on here then after a transitional sketch or interlude the record starts delivering more cuts from Rico that are actually kind of introspective the track relative the track sellout the track again and these are songs where Rico is a bit more honest about what drives her and what she hopes to get out of her music how she sees power in the expression of anger how she sees her art as an outlet and how she would like to use it to bolster herself up and help those who she loves around her and there's also moments where she's kind of giving her audience tidbits of inspiration admiring them for being focused and going through tough times with a brave face it's certainly more tasteful and thoughtful than some of the more mellow cuts Rico has dropped on past albums and reveals a side of her that we don't often see in this much depth on a project although it relatively this is a pretty short amount of songs so even though we are getting a glimpse of this it's almost barely a glimpse it's kind of like a snapshot especially given the song relative is one of the shortest and most low-impact songs on the entire project still some of the harder hitting cuts on this thing are pretty incredible the opening track cold is amazing Rico is screaming her brains out on this blood boiling refrain none of these pictures call is me many Rico's flow and her verses on this track sound absolutely manic like she is in desperate need of an exorcism her screamed ad-libs throughout the song make me feel like I'm experiencing some kind of psychosis also the instrumental on this thing is killer the loads of distortion the crushing bass hits and the mostly buried skittering percussion then there's the track cheat code where bauer enters the fold on the production and he seems to bring almost like an EDM vibe to the tract and along with Kenny splashes of industrial music and horror movie soundtracks as well as like punk rap the distorted relentless beat on this thing is hideous it is ugly I think in most contexts with most rappers it would not sound very good but Rico's incredibly nasty raspy voice just slices right through it like a neon pink chainsaw I'll say not a whole lot of the lyrics on this track are super intelligible but it's really about the aggression and the vibe of it and there's a pretty great buildup on the chorus to these song big titties featuring earth gang is absolutely hilarious and zany I love the bass II colorful beat on this one Bauer is in the fold once again the guest verses from Earth gang on this cut our incredible probably the best feature on this entire project they have great chemistry with Rico here and they're equally eccentric rap deliveries complement hers so well smooth flows hilarious hook on this thing yeah sure maybe the lyrics are a little shallow but I think that is easily made up for in just how ridiculous the track is now there are a few head scratchers in the tracklist here namely the cut hatin which is literally just a redo of jay-z's dirt off your shoulder and hey love the track I mean I remember when it dropped it was an incredible single and there are some kind of subtle instrumental changes made to the beat as well and I love Rico's themes on this track of Independence and self-sufficiency these song moods featuring splurge whoo I think I'm just hearing him for the first time on this track was kind of odd given that the splurges feature here is so awkward and mumbly and weak it sort of reminds me of a bad flow and a verse off of a recent little yadi album also the kind of plain basic structure of this track isn't doing it many favors either the chemistry level on this thing is super low it's easily my least favorite on the entire album and and really painfully forgettable a track on a record that is so short that it can't really afford to have a dud on it still I would say on average in comparison with nasty anger management may be an improvement because there's very little on this project that isn't worth listening to but I feel like we've only gotten there by scaling the project back so far that we're just reducing our chances of getting a dud do I see Rico progressing on this record even though it is short and has severely left me wanting more I guess a bit because it is kind of refreshing to hear moments like the closer where Rico does get a bit more personal I also like be recurring themes of anger and dealing with your emotions on this record - what you see on the outside versus what you actually feel on the inside so there are a lot of great things about anger management very good tracks on anger management Rico continues to be one of the more bold voices in the current rap landscape this is easily her most consistent project so far but but but I do think it's brevity is to its detriment and as much as I do like some of the more aggressive tracks on here I'm yet to really feel like Rico has truly topped some of her best past singles such as rage for example still though feeling a strong six to a light seven on anger management transition have you given this record listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry at the Bell is well over here next to my head is another

dXla6EZApEI,hi everyone breathe thinny deep tan here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new schoolboy q album crash talk this is the newest full-length album from Top Dawg entertainment signee schoolboy q easily the gruff estándar on a label he had a kind of interesting artistic trajectory up until this point with some early projects and mixtapes that didn't necessarily hit but once black hippy the collective he's a part of within Top Dawg entertainment began getting more attention in hip hop and the music world at large his album habits & contradictions became kind of an entry point for a lot of music fans a first introduction to Q if you will in my opinion the album was a little underwhelming but eventually Q built up from this to the fantastic record oxymoron which is easily one of the most cutting-edge mainstream rap records of this decade the inventive flows and instrumentals as well as the zany vocalizations that Q brings to the table on tracks like Lowe's awesome and collard greens they are as bold today as they were five years ago records like this definitely made it feel like we were in the midst of a bold new era for West Coast hip hop and for a lot of listeners as did cues follow up a few years later blank face now personally this record did not click for me I do not enjoy this album all that much but I can say it's it's admirably experimental with a lot of vocal layers totally out there features as well as beats that are really psychedelic and wild blank faces trippy it's surreal its nightmarish it points and it's easily one of the weirdest albums to fall under the hardcore gangsta rap umbrellas this decade now again not a huge fan of blank face but I can at least see the appeal of it I can see why many people hold this album in high esteem with crash talk though I feel like I'm at a total loss I do not see what is so exciting about this record and not even to insinuate that I'm seeing a whole lot of excitement around this album because I'm not this thing is not nearly as catchy or as well produced as oxy and blank-faced I would actually take even quite a few instrumentals off habits & contradictions over a lot of beats on this thing and the beats on this record quite a few of them sound really flat aggressive one-dimensional sort of like the types of instrumentals that you might have caught on soundcloud a few years ago hearing some random rapper from florida scream over it now of course that's not what cue is doing over these instrumentals if he was maybe that would be a bit more exciting all I'm trying to say is that the instrumentals feel like just kind of dated at this point like his plan was originally for this record to pop in and ride this wave of soundcloud rap that's almost starting to wash out now so whatever hope this album had of dominating in this style and putting a unique spin on it is pretty much gone still going in this direction does result in some serious bangers and highlights in the tracklist we have floating with 21 savage as well as 50 200 and even the track water which miraculously features what I think is maybe the best little baby feature I've ever heard but overall these tracks are really aggressive infectious kind of materialistic bangers with a lot of attitude despair generally though the recording and production aren't nearly as lush or creative as they were on cues past two projects and not that cue needed to drop another experimental album in order for it to be good but crash talk is shockingly plain and the song writing on this thing is super hit or miss whether you're talking about a track like num num juice which has some catchy bars some admirable refrains a decent instrumental but it's not built out to the point where it really makes any long-lasting impression and when cue does manage to drop a track that's built out a bit more it's an absolute flop like chopsticks with Travis Scott which honestly just sounds like really bad watered down Travis got left over with one of his worst hooks to date chopsticks chopsticks chopsticks the song lies with ty dolla sign and yg is another track that when it comes on I am scrambling to skip because the more I listen to it the more the image of school boy and yg just whining about some random woman lying about them is seared into my brain it's the corniest topic for a song there's also the vapid boring tedious and sleepy drunk which feels like it's trying to create the sense of being a neighbor like many great songs on oxymoron did but the sound of the instrumental and the effects on it are just way too thin to evoke much of anything I feel pretty much the same way about other tracks on this record that feature similarly surreal and dreamy vibes but just end up feeling like a less immersive leftover from blank face like black folk as well as dangerous featuring Kid Cudi and it's unfortunate the sound of these tracks is just so lackluster because I like a lot of the personal reflections that cue displays in the lyrics on these tracks these themes of addiction and the dangers of drug use depression the song attention feels like I'm listening to cue in his current state of Fame and success as if it is a fever dream or a nightmare now he does talk about some of the good things that have come along with this like being friends with his favorite producer and getting compliments from rappers who have influenced him but this story is also set within the context of all of the tough struggles Q had to face to get to this point and also the incredibly dark and grimy beat that's hanging in the background the track unfortunately fizzles out after a very awkward refrain and overall it's a very strange ending to this album which as I reflect on it doesn't really feel like it has much in the way of a flow a theme a concept a narrative a story it's like a loose collection of very scant very rough tracks that are super hit or miss and given what else is out there right now I can't really imagine listeners getting too excited over this record unless you're the type of person who's just SuperDuper invested in the artistic trajectory of Q if there's one thing I could give to this album it's definitely the writing I think q does come through with some solid bars one-liners verses when he is focusing on a topic or a concept that isn't stomach-churning but even some of the flows that he decides to go with are kind of off and his delivery seems a bit more understated than usual his presentation and his performance on this record is nowhere near is out there and is just in your face as it's been on previous records and honestly I think that's a mark against this album for the most part this album just feels like Q is playing it's super super super middle-of-the-road I'm feeling a light too decent 5 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you should check out hit

AaEQeb1pOuE,hi everyone white one here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the New Sun record life metal formed in Seattle in the late 90s Sun has always featured guitarists Greg Anderson and Steven O'Malley striking roaring down-tuned riffs that ring out into oblivion like Zeus's Thunderbolts flying down from the heavens ah most people don't take the duo's music that seriously but I do and I take the duo seriously because I think they're responsible for some of the most groundbreaking metal music of the 2000s between their label Southern Lord Records the many artists on it and Suns vast catalog of albums EPS and live recordings the band literally built their own thriving addition on to the gigantic house of metal now son are certainly not the first musical act out there to fuse elements of metal and ambient music but you would be hard-pressed to find someone out there that has done it more creatively and more consistently than son has and that statement stands even considering that over the past decades Suns output has not really been their best 10 years ago this year son did put out their record monoliths and dimensions which is easily their most critically acclaimed their most well received with their guitars sounding more gargantuan than ever Steve and Greg expanded Suns sound with chants and horns and even harp on a final track that was a tribute to none other than Alice Coltrane sadly the duo's output since the release of this album has been kind of scan or predicated entirely on a collaboration with another artist where their usual level of experimentation or adventure ends up taking a backseat or they just kind of play second fiddle and even though son did release sort of a proper album canon back in 2015 this was not only kind of a shorter record for the duo but also there was only 20 minutes of new original material on this project as one of the longer songs on here actually already appeared on the fantastic dome kirk live album they dropped in the 2000s and the live version of tract was infinitely better than what they delivered here so honestly as a son fan has a longtime son fan I have been waiting for a record of life metal size and focus for quite literally a decade now it's rigged for whatever reason it doesn't feel like it's been that long but it really has though like many other recent projects the duo have released life metal is also kind of based on a collaboration of sorts as the duo sees Steve Albini coming into the fold on this album legendary producer Steve Albini and Steve and son on this record do arguably draw up what is the duo's best sounding album to date best sounding and that is not a lie the guitars on this thing they sound so crisp and vivid and resonant it feels like I'm pretty much just like putting my ear right up against the band's amps and speaker cabinets and just letting it blast my brain out I mean that in the best way possible as much as I love altar in black 1 and monoliths and dimensions by comparison the guitar tones on those records are just a little bit darker a little bit muddier not quite as tangible as they are here on life metal and this is coming from a musical project whose guitar tones have sounded pretty much immaculate for the duration of their entire career I know the grim robe demos are kind of rough but at least they labeled them as demos I digress though I've seen some live several times and the sound quality of the guitars on this record is almost indistinguishable from that of just seeing them in person and this clarity enhances very subtle intricacies between the two roaring droning guitars in the mix these very small but amazing little bits of dissonance and harmony especially on key moments of the track Aurora the clarity of a record sound isn't always the main selling point of that album yes but Sun is not your usual music group son and the appreciation of sound and its heaviness and its movement and its physicality are basically inseparable there is certainly a brightness to why metal that I think no other Sun album up until this point has and that may in fact be the reasoning behind naming this album life metal since a lot of the material on this record doesn't necessarily feel like I'm staring into a deep dark endless abyss like on every other Sun record up until this point rather life metal feels like I'm staring straight on into these burning rays of light also a very intense kind of experience but but still a different one occasionally Steve in the duo try to enhance the guitars and the compositions on this record with some extra instrumentation and their mixed results the hushed female vocals placed throughout certain points on the intro of this album are perplexing and a little frustrating I do like the melodies that they're singing and I love the kind of quaint and very subtle delivery but it's their EQ and it's their placement and it's their volume in the mix that just does not make any sense it's like I'm listening to the duo live they're right in front of me the guitars are roaring but then there's like a couple people singing right up next to my ear while it's all going on and I can barely make out what they're singing or what they're doing because the guitars are so friggin loud but because they're so close to me and they're singing right in my ear I can feel it there and thinking back to vocal placements earlier in the band's discography on white 2 and black 1 and monoliths and so on and so forth this is easily one of the worst in the entire Sun catalogue thankfully I guess they don't take up that much of the songs overall composition and I do love the occasional very bright shots of wailing guitar leads on this track it certainly does enhance the bright vibe of the song the droning strings that come into focus after the guitars melt away on the closing track here are a somewhat nice touch even if I do think the sound of them and the drone they create isn't nearly as stimulating as many of the guitar phases throughout this album and the keys and organ layers on the track troubled air actually creates one of the most beautifully sinister moments in the entire Sun discography it just feels so supremely gothic in how it's simultaneously dark but also harmonious but honestly outside of these moments life metal is a very very very meat-and-potatoes drone metal album if there even is such a thing I guess what I'm saying here is if you're familiar with their earlier days of Suns discography how simple a lot of the guitar drones on those records were it feels like life metal is very much going back into that direction and maybe just throwing off this need or this pressure to add to the duo's sound to make it more palatable to those who don't care for drone music or ambient music and while I get that loud droning distorted guitars have very much been the duo's bread and butter for a very long time I think it's also kind of a stereotype to simply Boyle sons music down to simply that as there are quite a few tracks throughout the duo's discography like bass aliens or Bathory or Sabbath that sees them indulging a bit more in space and ambience and songs like these as well as the core drone tracks of albums like white one as well as void or black one contributed to these albums feeling like son wasn't just making drone music but also we're just on the threshold of the unknown and engaging in some really serious experimentation and in my opinion life metal very much lacks that same sense of risk or adventure I don't get the sense that we're really riding the fringes on this album and instead are just resting on our laurels a bit and delivering a very well established sound and I get that's mostly by designs son are obviously giving us a record that has a narrow focus like that of their early works and surely that's due to the recording of this album being so phenomenal the duo obviously feels comfortable delivering a straightforward drone album on this one because it just sounds so frigging good and personally I don't know if that's enough for me to be head over heels for this record honestly as good as this album sounds there is kind of a sense of been there done that okay as much as I do think the sound of this album is great it's not necessarily a reason not to keep exploring what the unknown has to offer the lack of risks overall on life metal does leave this album in my opinion feeling a bit average for son and I emphasize force there because for the duo to drop an album that is as lengthy and is focused as life metal it's it's an occasion and in the grander scheme of things is pretty great at the end of the day I think life metal is a perfectly fine enjoyable Sun record powerful sound on here otherworldly atmospheres never-ending drones that melt the mind and create a truly surreal experience and even if I'm not super crazy about some of the writing or the predictability of this record there is something to be said for the fact that the band is back at writing songs that push to or push past the 20-minute mark and still manage to stay pretty immersive and engaging and that immersiveness is a quality that I think a lot of Suns most recent material has been lacking a little bit so to see them put out another album that gets back to that is a triumph in itself I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're

Pc40i-8kHlM,hi everyone if me bangs Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Kevin abstract album Arizona baby this is a new collection of tracks from singer songwriter producer mr. Kevin abstract one of the key figures in the groundbreaking boy band Brock Hampton and now with a pretty spectacular run of projects with the group he seems to be going back to dropping solo material don't worry though I don't think this is necessarily a signal that Brock Hampton is on the rocks or anything around the time the Kevin announced the release of this project or the slow release through which he would drop a few tracks at a time from this new album he had also put out a casting call for something Brock Hampton we're working on so I think it's safe to say the group is still active one more thing that makes this not really that unusual is before Brock Hampton blew up Kevin had his own small but dedicated fan base of listeners and I think it would only make sense that he would eventually go back to releasing music in a solo capacity as a result of that as the Arizona baby single which developed into the ghetto baby EP and now we have the full Arizona baby album all 11 tracks and 30 or so minutes of it and as a result of this album being released in that fashion I've kind of laid down my opinions on a good deal of the material here already most of which haven't really changed now that the entire project is out I still love the bars and flows that Kevin laced into the opening track big wheels but found the basic beat and the brevity of the track overall to take away from the song's impact the horn leads at the very end of the cut though are pretty fantastic and I love the way it transitions into the next song the track Joyride is still at this moment pretty overproduced and busy to my ears out of all the tracks here it's obviously the most indebted to Andre 3000 I think very much pulling from the instrumental vibe of the love below still I do admire the instrumental ambition that ramil and Kevin and Jack Antonoff of bleachers Fame are showing on this track it's easily one of the grandest presentations of sound on the entire record and some of the hooks and refrains Kevin weaves into this track are still pretty catchy I will say Georgia has certainly grown on me a little bit the Audrey influence on this track is still pretty prominent but I do love the seamless blend of R&B and pop and country on this cut Kevin's verses are actually some of the most personal on the entire album with him going back to his younger years struggling in school against his teachers struggling with being in the closet leaving his troubled home and not knowing where he's going in life when he's out on the road trying to get his music career off the ground the song Corpus Christi is even sadder and sees Kevin turning the clock forward to a time where he's essentially airing out the depression the isolation the attacks and the feelings of being a total failure that came along with the accusations that led to a mere vans exit from Brock Hampton the track is a pained apology to everybody he even mentions Brock Hampton member Dom because he's saying sorry for bringing this up in a track in the first place the fact that this song comes together so coherently despite the intense emotions surrounding it is pretty impressive Kevin's rapping here comes off more like a nervous confessional diatribe than it does your usual flow the song baby boy is an excellent single from this record it's easily my favorite here it sees Kevin improving on and bringing back the wonderful fusion of indie music and singer-songwriter music and in bedroom pop and hip hop and R&B that made his last record American boyfriend so unique tried-and-true chord progression on this one Ryan Beaty's guest vocals on the cut are immaculate and I love how lavish the instrumental on this thing is with those luscious strings and yet it still kind of maintains this homespun kind of DIY vibe I also love how tracks on this album like crumble and Peach also strike a similar balance of you had those elements of pop and acoustic music and R&B and hip hop comes together really well sadly though I do think this album's ambition and cohesion does tend to drop off in the second half as the pitched vocals on the track Mississippi over the course of the song to my ear has just become a bit much I do not really get the brevity of the song use me as well as the very prominent cricket samples placed throughout the track which to my ears are just interrupts even if I do love Kevin's bars his flows and the numerous gospel choir samples placed throughout the track which are pretty gorgeous Kevin's rhymes about seeing his loved ones addicted to hard drugs on this track are pretty stunning but still this is one of many examples on this album where you have a track loaded with great ideas but then they are marred with a few lackluster ones and also aren't extended out to the point where they have much impact up to the final verse where Kevin raps about the impact that Tyler the Creator had on him the track American problem is a total mess between the pitched and goofy sung and rapped vocals the incessant and repetitive refrains as well as the needlessly woozy instrumental this track to me is is really just a traffic jam it's like the most obnoxious chamber pop rap with like a splash of Vampire Weekend thrown in there for some reason and while I do love Kevin's bars his flow and the incredibly bumpin beat on the track Boyer it's a very odd choice for a closer leaving the album itself feeling like it's just kind of fizzling out unfortunately this record is just kind of scant inconsistent all over the place some amazing highs though and lyrical content that for hardcore Kevin and Brock Hampton fans you're most likely going to get a lot out of it I can really tell Kevin was bottling much of what he has said on this album up for quite a while and waited to put it out so that he could get it onto a record onto a platform that is a bit more intimate a bit more personal still having said that though there are a lot of lyrics on this record that do have me kind of concerned and that's not a mark for or against the album or anything like that it just does make me worried as somebody who's been listening to Kevin's music for a little bit now and sort of seeing him admit and say in lyrics that he's not dealing with the pressures that have come along with the highs and lows of Brock Hampton in the healthiest way you could actually say that some of what he's saying here is a little self-destructive but obviously he would not have put it out there onto a record if I think he didn't want his fans or his listeners to gain from it in some way if he didn't think it was going to make for a quality album and it is certainly compelling to see Kevin's struggle not only with the newfound popularity that he's gained through Brock Hampton but also how he's balanced that with his family his friends his boyfriend as well I don't know if lyrically and musically there's a whole lot on this record that's really going to transcend outside of the already established Brock Hampton and Kevin abstract fanbase but given how intimate and personal a lot of the material on this record is maybe that wasn't Kevin's intention in the first place on Arizona baby I am feeling a strong six transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video for you to check out hit that up or the link to

F8cp-sgGH8E,hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for our weekly track roundup where I go over new tracks that were dropped throughout the week that I felt were some good tracks and some tracks that's a good tracks we have linked all of them down there in the description box for you guys as usual quickly before we get into the list of tracks I do want to mention that I have a tour coming up it is literally a week away DEFCON five tours on the way tours around the corner fun speaking engagements it's sort of a mix of funny silliness seriousness TEDTalk style there's a PowerPoint it's ridiculous cow chest is there and here are the dates it's all west coast in North America Vancouver date is sold out so a tickets for that are bye-bye we also still have tickets available though at Seattle Portland San Fran Los Angeles and San Diego again this is around the corner and some of the venues are selling pretty well at this point far beyond halfway sold out so if you do want to go I recommend getting tickets sooner rather than later instead of just kind of you know waiting around so alright hope to see you guys there and let's get into that weekly track roundup shall we first off I want to shout out our Amazon and turntable lab associate links if you feel like treating yourself hit those up and here are the worst tracks the worst tracks of the week first off let's let's go with the new taylor swift cut me featuring Brendon Urie of Panic at the Disco yes I was not all that crazy about this track I do find it to be a little refreshing though to see Taylor back at kind of writing a love on the rocks dramatic very sugary poppy tune instead of giving us another helping of a edgy angry revenge snake Taylor that's probably my least favorite Taylor so far this feels a little bit back in her you know wheelhouse but still it's truly an overproduced tune that has a lot of awful things going for it in the production instrumentation just the overall sound of it which is very bland and just a little overdone I think the song at the core of it is okay but I don't know there's just so many factors working against this track it ended up being one of my favorites rather least favorites of the week moving on from there this new track honesty from the one and the only pink sweats who is an artist that up until this point I haven't really been all that familiar with but this sort of to my ears it sounds like a bad version of Frank Ocean in fact this track kind of confirms it for me that Frank Ocean is not really just an artist or a person but also in himself genre and if that is in fact the case this is definitely one of the weaker tracks in that genre a new track from Kim Petrus broken a lot of people been making a lot of fuss over the song this week but to Myers it just sounds like a painfully generic pop tune with a few scaring trap rhythms in the background very Spacey and dramatic like a lot of modern pop tunes are these days and this one to my ears just did not stand out in the worst possible way like it's painfully by the numbers I guess is is my main complaint with it moving out from there we have a not really a b-side but I think a Deeside from James Blake this new Mulholland track which sort of sounds like the beginnings of a somewhat decent James Blake tune but then it's chipmunk tanned pitched and some weak beats are thrown in the background and some of the piano sections are chopped up awkwardly there's um I don't know that there's there's not a whole lot exciting about this track it sort of sounds like a an okay James Blake ballad but brought to a chop shop and then it's just like pulled apart and ripped to shreds and then turned into something that's not really all that fulfilling moving on from there we also have a brand new cut from house II which is a cut of the Frank Ocean song solo second time Frank Ocean is coming up in this video oh and as if artists out there sounding like a weaker version of Frank Ocean wasn't worse enough we actually have healthy out here doing a really awful rendition of what's possibly my favorite Frank Ocean song solo it's completely lacking in the charisma and swagger that the original cut has and instead just again sounds like a really Spacey overproduced flavorless faux dramatic pop song with very breathy boring lead vocals thrown on top of it and also want to give a bit of a shout-out here to the new Bruce Springsteen track which yes this isn't my worst section of the week his new song hello sunshine which I guess is pleasant but it just sounds like very boring run-of-the-mill boomer balladry without a whole lot going for it in terms of flavor personality excitement it's just so utterly sleep-inducing I really have nothing to say about it outside of that honestly all right let's move on to the tracks that I thought were kind of meant but still worth shouting out still worth shouting out maybe you might like him a a little bit more than me excuse me first off we have this brand-new Black Keys cut which sounds almost like a if you pay specific attention to the watery weird effects laid onto the vocals of this track almost feels like a group trying to do a somewhat vintage but psychedelic take on the blues not one of the Bands more solid songs and their discography but certainly better than a lot of what was on their last record I preferred their last single from their new album quite a bit more but uh but I guess it's still got kind of a raw bit of a swagger to it to the sounds a little loaf I it's a little fuzzy a little trippy maybe the vocals are a bit bland and boring but still not terrible not terrible by any stretch of the imagination still looking forward to this new Black Keys LP certainly certainly moving on from there another track from this music project that goes by the name of pronoun that I've been following for a little bit now every single song from this project I mean as much as I've been following this I'm not sure if I'm going to end up liking the new album because everything I'm hearing from this project so far just sounds so all over the place like very little in the way of consistency but still I was intrigued by the mix of like jangle pop and dream pop and shoegaze on this new cut over here which has not really been the exact blend of sounds popping up on the previous songs from this project up until this point still though to neppy heart of this track seemed okay but I did like despite some of the kind of lo-fi and bedroom pop style production on this thing that pronoun was able to stir up legitimately kind of thick and shoegazing and weird sound here so I'm kind of digging that about this song anyway and I should say at least that the track over here if I didn't say already it's a titled Sadie we would often their pile has come out with a brand new track hair is the name of the song and while this is not the ferocious Indian post-hardcore that I have typically enjoyed the most in the band's discography I do kind of like the surprisingly country direction the group takes this new song in while again it's not one of the most thrilling tracks I think they've ever done I think the balladry at the core that is pretty solid moving on from there Lucy Dacus comes through with a new track my mother and I Mother's Day just around the corner and that quite a moving ballad over here thought it was a little maybe too low-key for my taste underwhelming just a bit but still you know if you're into her stuff you're a new boy genius and all that stuff this new wave of indie flavored female singer-songwriters they're being championed by a lot of music review sites right now certainly do not miss out on this track moving out from there Flying Lotus has seen fit to drop two more tracks from his forthcoming and very long a new album but both of them were totally head scratchers for me though first off we have spontaneous featuring little dragon and the track Takashi both of which I thought were definitely flying Lotus punching under his weight the instrumental and the vocal performance delivered by little dragon on spontaneous were totally weak and frankly the sound of this song was very flat and not as experimental or as layered as I typically enjoy flying lotuses music to be following that Takashi was even more perplexing because this cut to me sounded like what could what could have been some very interesting groovy funky beat music but the tempo was sped up too fast and it's like it's kind of speeding by trying to finish very quickly or something for some reason and this track is well to me the colors and the layers on this one felt particularly weak don't know if I'm gonna end up getting blown away by these tracks once I hear them in the context of the entire album I can certainly say despite the fact that there wasn't a whole lot of music in it I did like that David Lynch cut quite a bit you know it was unsettling it was intriguing but hearing tracks that I guess are a bit more musically geared now from the record I'm walking away a little unimpressed unfortunately moving on from there we have a brand new collaborative cut from my dude cleaner who I have covered on the channel and the segment a few times he has a cut out with Andy Milonakis now a comedian writer actor and the song of theirs is all about being a thick a thick boy so if you're kind of thick if you are thick if you like yourself a thick boy you might like this song moving on from there I want to give a shout out to beak Geoff barrows project because you are into some experimental electronic everything influenced everything from hip hop to electronic stuff to post-punk to art rock everything sort of goes into barrows beak and of course longtime fans of portishead should should know his connection to to that legendary music outfit - moving on oh and also I want to say on the name of this track as life goes on it's it's a pretty fun listen maybe yeah maybe a little average for for beak up until this point but still pretty fun track all right moving on from there I want to give a shout out to one of my favorite tracks this week remember these are all my favorite tracks and they're all linked down there below first off we have yg the tracks stop snitching which is pretty straightforward pretty repetitive really brings the message home very quickly and and does so with many refrains again many repetitions but I'm kind of liking here hearing yg go back into this more raw more topical catch your direction sort of seems like where he operates best I feel like a lot of tracks from his last full length album we're trying a little bit too hard to sound widely appealing and sound commercial and sound trendy whereas this just makes a lot more sense in in my opinion it's unforgiving it is mean it is nasty it has a focus to it and I am definitely loving it despite how basic it is in a lot of ways moving out from there Willie Nelson has a beautiful new ballad I thought was pretty nice ride me back home a wonderful story to the song lush gorgeous instrumentation tried-and-true chords and again just a lovely tune at the core of all of it and very I guess an intimate pretty recording at the end of it too so digging on this one quite a bit moving on from there storm Z whose last full-length album storms the UK rapper whose last for like that one really underwhelmed me felt like he was trying a little bit too hard to make UK hip hop and even to a degree Grimes sound more interesting to an American audience has come through with a straight banger on this one bossy Bop is the name of it very catchy flows clever wordplay and lyrics and a fantastic instrumental it is short it is sweet it is to the point it is viral it is infectious I'm liking it quite a bit and a very fantastic music video attached to this one too moving on from there we have a new track from 88 risings Nicki sort of they're a little R&B star to be who's got quite a bit of songwriting talent and vocal talent at her disposal and she has a new cut over here tied loke which i think is very lovely and sweet tune at the core of this one love her vocals on it to get it quite a bit moving on from there we have a new track from a project by the name of manic and  which I don't think I've talked about up until this point and I don't know how aware of this projects music I've been up until now but I feel like I've seen this name before because it's too ridiculous not to remember it and a drunk - is the name of this track and even though in a lot of respects it does have a very run-of-the-mill low-key sad downtrodden nineties rock indie rock kind of aesthetic to it the vocals and the vocal performance on top of this track are actually incredible and really sell the song really sell the heartbreak and the drama and the the emotional pain of this track quite a bit it's actually a pretty fantastic moving on from there we have a new track from Kieren J Kalinin as well if I recall correctly I was a little underwhelmed by the last track off of his new full-length album which is coming out very soon but this new one over here it takes a muscle to fall in love it takes the muscle to fall in love a little melodramatic and overly poetic there Kieran but still I thought it was a lovely ballad with a much more toned down delivery and kind of a very pretty 80s rock 80s pop chain to it that's very cute very cute moving on from their King gizzard and the lizard wizard the birdsong is the name of the band's new cut over here not going to talk too much at length about it I do like it but what I'm gonna say here is that the band's new record is out I am going to review it this week and that is not going to make me talk about this song too much right now because I'm gonna be putting all my thoughts about this album down in that review so look forward to that I suppose moving on from there we have Japanese breakfast with the track essentially a track that has been dropped via this sort of w hotels single series I suppose the money goes to the ACLU as well so it's a cool charity slash promotional thing and Japanese breakfast is music up until this point I could kind of take her leave but I do like this new single quite a bit it's got a very nice synth pop aesthetic to it and which I know is very much in her wheelhouse but isn't what she's always going for all the time so if you do like that more purist synth pop sound when she does indulge in that direction you're probably gonna love this new single quite a bit song at the core of it is pretty solid vocals a bit faint but still overall loved it quite a bit I thought it was really good moving on from there fka twigs if you guys follow the Fantana channel youtube.com slash Fantana you know that i've already reviewed this track and full and that i love it love the pianos on this track love the surreal trippy unsettling edits on this song think twigs very intense but I guess somewhat reserved at points vocals are really fantastic think the ending fizzled out a bit more than I would have liked but kind of loving this new slightly more organic direction for twigs hoping to hear more music in this style from her going down the road I think it's really cool and I want to go shout out to Charles Bradley who has dropped a posthumous single over here lonely as you are which is a very just powerhouse of a soul song I mean Charles Bradley up until this point I've never been the biggest fan of but this track features easily one of his most stunning vocal performances that that I've ever heard frankly and I've tried nearly every one of his records since he's been a thing on DAP tone so loving this song quite a bit just loving the drama and the power and his voice loving the emotional pain coming through on this vocal performance quite a bit lush instrumental maybe a bit cleaner than one would accept a run would expect rather listening to Charlie's music up until this point because his instrumental backdrop is usually a very vintage soul and obviously the instrumental here is is pulling from that a bit but it's very clean very modern and again vocal performance on top of it absolutely stunning and that has been our weekly track round up everybody thank you very much for watching I remember all of the tracks I talked about in this video linked down below if you want to hear them for yourself and also shout out once more to the tour we got coming up there the dates right there link to the tickets down below and you're the best you're the best you're the best best best cool cool Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever 
FGILPXMZHXw,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Beyonce live record homecoming the live album this is a new live album from one of the most iconic and game-changing singers of this generation Queen Bee Beyonce this project is essentially a 2018 live recording of Beyonce's Coachella performance which marked the first time a black woman had headlined what's arguably the largest music festival running today and the performance on this one was certainly one for the history books with a career spanning setlist featuring not only tracks from Beyonce's last full length album lemonade but also Destiny's Child cuts to where she's of course backed up by Kelly Rowland as well as Michelle Williams jay-z and J Balvin also make appearances during the setlist as well though this is not a very feature heavy album or anything the main focus on this album is most certainly Beyonce and the massive drumline in horn section she assembled for the performance on this thing which is honestly a genius way of transcribing all these songs that cover so many different eras in Beyonce's career the horns the drumline the backup singers all curry a very cohesive sound as we move from hits that range from twenty to two years old Beyonce even manages to deliver deep cuts on this thing like I've been on which I'm pretty sure was a SoundCloud only drop a tribute to southern hip-hop Houston hip-hop chopped and screwed with Beyonce rapping in these pitch down vocals on a trap beat so again all of this live instrumentation all these drums keep the momentum and the excitement in this performance very high and also allow Beyonce to deliver these songs in a medley type fashion where you're getting little snippets of of the biggest tracks of her career all segwaying into each other very seamlessly the only moments on this album where I think be recording and the performance really loses some steam is where the drums and the horns fade away in favor of whatever the original instrumental was for the track that beyonce is performing this happens during cuts on this album like Yonsei and formation and partition tracks that by no means should be a lull during a Beyonce album they're some of her biggest bangers ever and beyonce is vocally going as hard as possible on some of these tracks like really laying the swag on heavy and sometimes grunting or shrieking or just like really throwing in these wild vocal embellishments and I'm sure these cuts sounded amazing live during this performance but the mix of this live record is a little wonky there's so much reverb and ambient noise surroundings of the instrumentals played in the background of these tracks that they're kind of hollowed out don't have enough punch they leave Beyonce vocally feeling a little unsupported this isn't generally an issue for the tracks that feature more horns more drumline as they do have a lot more presence in the mix and the performances on these drums and horns is so phenomenally tight it's just rare you hear this sort of thing platformed on an album with this much exposure it brings a really fresh and dynamic sound to Beyonce's classics especially when they take it upon themselves to revise some of her biggest and most popular songs in very creative ways I'm definitely partial to the way beyonce broke down the song sorry at one point with this funny routine she had going on with the Bugaboos and the way they picked the track up after that totally reinventing it there are plenty of other cuts on this record too or beyonce is playing the hits a bit straighter but still these singers the horns the drums are worked into the original instrumental pretty creatively so it feels like you're hearing a new version entirely like on the song diva where the group vocals and chants on that track sort of raise it to like new levels of epic I wouldn't say all reinventions on this record go over without a hitch though flawless is definitely one that stuck out to me is a bit awkward a little bit like a sore thumb Beyonce's very aggressive vocalizations over the incredibly faint synth line in the background just feels overpowering but for every moment like this on Homecoming there is a countdown or there is a hold up or Beyonce gives just a stunning vocal performance also her rendition of the track iCare with the added drums the extra touch of reverb and the super glossy kind of futuristic synths on that track it sounds very close to the original but with all this added extra sound and this sort of organic in the moment feel of the track it's almost like I'm listening to a cross between the original cut and Bill Collins in the tonight it's like on that level of grandiosity we're hearing this original Beyonce track fused with some art rock and arena rock vibes there is a portion in the set list where Beyonce starts pulling on some tracks that have more of an international flavor inherit us cog Rafi the J Balvin Sami gente where she had a feature not too long ago is performed here with Dalvin appearing on the Coachella stage with her we also have the track baby boy from back in the day featuring Sean Paul a dancehall flavoured hit that featured some production from Scott Storch back in the day and finally to tie this moment up we have the reggae flavored you don't love me this is maybe not one of my favorite sections during the setlist or anything don't really care for the J Balvin track all that much but that's not really Beyonce's original song anyway still even though this isn't one of my favorite moments on the entire homecoming setlist the transitions during this spot are just as amazing and flawless as they are everywhere else after this moment in the setlist we pretty much go on a trip down memory lane beyonce starts dishing out some of her biggest classics some of those Destiny's Child tracks ends it all off with the very soulful love on top a cute Blue Ivy interlude and also some thank yous to the backup dancers the production crew the drumline everybody and all in all this this thing is mega mega mega mega mega mega mega impressive even with a few duds in the tracklist and a less than impressive mix job on this thing the I'm partially just speechless because this is just a live performance of epic proportions beyonce really pulled out all the stops on this thing the performance and the way all these tracks are melded together is so impressive it overcomes easily what few aspects of this album are less than perfect it's like hearing the entire Beyonce catalog filtered through the sound of a pep rally at a historically black university and quite possibly one of the most ambitious live records ever to be released to the point where I think even non Beyonce fans can listen to this thing and come away relatively blown away by just how above and beyond she went with what she presented here I'm feeling a decent - strong 8 on this thing transition have you given this record listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Beyonce homecoming forever 
-deQEteXUK4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new year old Droog record it wasn't even close your old ruge is an elusive lyricist based out of New York who was once thought to actually be nas putting out music anonymously when his breakthrough EP dropped a while ago but of course we've since learned that is not the case and now he is on his third full-length album which is his first in a couple of years and they were a few very silent years in fact the silence in between this record and his last full length record was kind of deafening and even concerning because I would hate to see this man's output disappear because if we look at the momentum in the buzz surrounding Droog at this point in his career it is much different in a lot less intense than it was when he initially broke onto the scene which the way that it happened was kind of a blessing and a curse sure he got a lot of attention right out of the gate but also what came with that were some weird expectations that almost no other new artist has on them on top of it while droogs entire discography up until this point has been pretty solid there's been little to no effort to build upon the very vintage and specific brand of lyrical hip-hop that he pulls so heavily from on this newest record over here there is a bit of a more abstract and experimental change of pace even though voices like nas and big Ellen even the games still have a pretty profound influence on Droog sound no doubt MF DOOM as well as he appears on this project and also drew a bitch alii raps about himself in the third person he's not shy about that almost as if he's commenting on his own actions or a character like a narrator but again I see Droog is embracing a slightly different mood on this project as a lot of the instrumentals on this record put him in league with a lot of his New York cohorts who are wrapping over similarly spacey minimal abstract and kind of unlikely instrumentals the likes of Billy watts and lucid as well as Rocky Marciano and kah and in a way I see this instrumental shift happening in the New York underground is kind of a natural progression of hip-hop from the East Coast that still celebrates lyrics giving audiences instrumentals that really spotlight the lyricist give them a lot of space to work as opposed to the current mainstream of pop rap and pop trap where the instrumentals are so melodic loud and banging that they often drown out the emcee at the center of all of it so stripping back the beats more on this record definitely puts more of a focus on what Droog is saying and it definitely works to prevent his style prevent his lyrics from sounding all that dated or in the past having said that though I still think the bars on this album are some of the best Droog has spit so far in his career structurally though a lot of these tracks are kind of flat don't really have a lot of dimensions to them in that respect this album does leave a bit to be desired if you're looking for strong hooks or interesting beat switches the fact that Droog as a lyricist and as a rapper is pretty compelling and as clever as ever does a lot to make up for that as there are witty and mind-bending gems on pretty much every track here and look that's not to downplay the production which I said before is kind of low-key a little spaced out the instrumentals are cool but not overbearing they're subtle but still come off kind of eclectic like with the soap opera organ leads and delayed vocal samples on the track rst there's also a pretty cool implementation of a Sean Price sample on this track also the droning heavy bass and the fazed guitar leads on the track world's about to end which sounds like a super old dramatic fusion of funk and alternative rock like something you would hear out of a verse on a on a Rage Against the Machine song in the mid 90s there's also the dusty vintage Reed melodies on the track babushka where it sounds like true giz having sampled some old incidental television music the title of the song is a cute embrace of droogs Eastern Bloc roots as well as a nod to a bit of banter on the end of the song about how the track is like Grandma appropriate and speaking of grandmas not only does drew brag on this record about sort of appealing to Grandma's but also a lot of the references on this thing are pretty dated not necessarily a bad thing as it'll most likely play very well with the old head audience Droog has kind of attracted but still even with a lot of the vintage references on this thing the combinations of influences and nods both Musical and cultural are pretty eclectic and unlikely you have witty word playing bars that point directly to shock Howard Stern and Don Imus the film Trading Places the experimental guitarist Buckethead actress Lucy Lawless the hanna-barbera cartoon character Magilla gorilla and the South Pole clothing brand I mean there's a bar in the opening track of this record where he literally says my shorty looks straight off that yellow poster remember those this thing is like the hip-hop equivalent of a nostalgia based comedy stand-up set remember this cultural reference remember this cultural reference whoa whoa whoa the the past is crazy Droog is truly truly truly and honestly an old soul and whether or not his nods and references go over your head because of your age the one-liners and the lyrical tangents he goes on on this LP are really what sells this record there are lines on here like I don't know who's slicker I do this even when I'm under the weather like a news ticker under the weather like a news ticker I'll shop when we win in I've been plotting since last August got a leg up on them like dog piss then there's all the gorillas baboon primate monkey references throughout the track rst that carry through the guest verses it's actually a pretty smart way to bring a threaded theme throughout the song also on the track on tried by 13 existential dread ain't nothing but a Rasta philosopher oh my god Wow okay man okay thinking it's all PG like Disney you should see how nasty her Pixar Pixar and look there's lots more where that came from that is literally the tip of the lyrical iceberg when it comes to this album if you want to be hit with bar after bar after bar that'll have you like just hitting the rewind button and going back and listening to it over again so you get it because it's kind of like a weird funny hilarious clever lyrical Rubik's Cube it you know this is it also the guest features on this thing for the most part are fantastic the first Mikami guest verse is very good MF DOOM is fantastic on this thing Wiki of Rat King Fame is as smooth as ever also little ugly Mane on the track where he's featured where the beats which comes in he is absolutely twisted on his appearance on this record really the only feature I didn't care for it all was the second and kind of unnecessary Mikami feature and it's kind of confusing the drop in quality from the first one to the second one on this same album where he kicks the song off being barely even on the tempo to the point where it's so awkward it ruins the track not only that but it sounds like he's rapping into a gamer headset microphone I'm also kind of scratching my head at how rough the mixes on the track chasing ghosts featuring rock Marciano whose inclusion on this track I like quite a bit but drew is is strangely mixed very low on this song to the point where he's kind of being drowned out in the beat there's also the track haunted house beat toward the end of this record which is literally like this overextended kind of eerie hip-hop instrumental with I guess some Halloween inspired intentions really just an unnecessary interlude placed at a weird moment on the album I also want to know before you yourself go into this LP to listen to it that drug is not necessarily the most politically correct rapper in the game it would seem that his point of view and maybe even his politics come from the same era that his references do in a lot of respects as there is a point on this album where he raps about almost being tricked by a trans woman in a way that seems less tied to a specific experience and more just a function of perpetuating the stereotype that trans women and trans people just exists to trick others into sleeping with them and on the end of the track world's about to end there is this very extended clip from an episode of The Cosby Show that has become kind of infamous at this point where Bill Cosby is bragging about his sauce his barbecue sauce which apparently has the power to turn people on it's kind of an aphrodisiac and of course in light of the recent allegations against Bill Cosby this portion of this episode of the show seems really really weird and Droog make sure to of course set this vocal snippet to some very dramatic and dark and and unsettling music to just further push that reminder of Bill these history of sexual assault to the forefront of your mind and whether or not you see the legitimately dark humor in what he's trying to do at this point on the record is really up to you so even though Droog style his reference points and even to a degree his outlook may be kind of dated or even a little dark it's not like it's something that he hides from the listener as he raps on this very album play the alleys like a stray never pet sick puppy it didn't get put down by a vet so I like this record quite a bit I think it's got a lot of great qualities to it though it is a little inconsistent and kind of all over the place it's a hodgepodge of sounds and ideas it's a little rough around the edges to the point where I think it prevents this album from its full potential but also I can't help but admit that it's also part of the appeal of this album to begin with as there is kind of a thrill with listening to an album that feels like you are rifling through Drew's lyrical notebook and making note of all the cross-outs and rewrites and notes in the margins so while there are a lot of moments on this record that I love there's also a handful of cuts too that I felt were just a little messy maybe underwhelming from a structure standpoint could have used a stronger hook more punch or even more length lyrically though I can't deny Droog has gotten better since his last album and he's got the kind of talent that has made him one of the more magnetic emcees in the underground right now a musician's musician in a way which is why you see people like rock marciano as well as MF DOOM so desperate to work with him on this record one could also argue Droog is making some of the most interesting instrumental choices of his career so far - and this album is very clearly a labor of love but it is a kind of unfocused labor and I think the many blemishes on this album do more to add to Jukes character than it does necessarily this album's quality I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video for you

7gIjHFZsoxk,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new cage the elephant album social cues this is the latest full-length LP from Cage the Elephant a rock band that has had a pretty interesting trajectory over the years somehow transitioning from making very boilerplate radio-friendly garage rock and alternative rock to releasing one of the noisiest trickiest and most well produced rock records of 2013 melophobia but the further away we get from that album the more I fear that it may have been some kind of flash in the pan I don't know because the band's next record a couple years later was already a very obvious drop in quality stylistically it seemed like it was hanging very much in the same indie alternative garage stomping grounds but with diminishing returns as this record really had a total lack of novelty of memorable songwriting so with social cues over here I was really hoping for some kind of redemption an improvement however I wasn't very enticed by the teaser tracks on this record to be completely honest I didn't find them very catchy at all and they failed to in my opinion forecast any new exciting sound or direction for the band the song Nightrunner touts a surprise feature from none other than Beck but his vocal performance on the track is kind of awkward and leaves a lot to be desired plus the instrumental is a very middle-of-the-road uninspired Garage twist on double egg a that I don't really get a lot out of but I was kind of wrong going into this record assuming that the band wouldn't have a new or a cohesive idea or theme in mind for social cues because in comparison with everything Cage the Elephant has done up until this point this album is definitely their moodiest I won't go as far as to say this record is dark even if a bulk of the material seems very directly inspired by dark times experienced by band member mette Schultz who suffered the loss of a few fret and also his marriage over the course of the creation of this album still many of the tracks on this thing don't really come off all that tortured or bleak sure there's a vague sense of dreariness throughout the album I guess there are some dark intentions on this record but for the most part in my view I don't really see them as having all that much teeth and that's kind of the issue I have with social cues generally as dramatic as some of these tracks try to come off it doesn't really feel like it goes far enough much of the time the instrumentation is too agreeable the performances are too tame again given what has inspired a lot of the material on this record there is a severe lack of trauma or danger or thrills coming out of the vocals here even as the band kicks this record off singing about being born on the wrong side of the tracks I mean the edge is there but it's kind of a dull edge it's like being threatened with the butter knife I mean sure it could hurt you if some psychopath is wielding it but it's it's still not as scary as like you know a machete there are tracks on here the feature some earier instrumentation but it just kind of comes off sounding like Cage the Elephant are a bunch of dudes wearing color-coordinated blazers at the high school Halloween dance just like rocking out to some Monster Mash which is kind of the case on the track house of glass also the song Tokyo smoke which features these really awful faint guitars in these whippin synth sounds in the background that are totally unnecessary also the title track on here points of which sound like what you would get if you forced these strokes to write a song that sounded kind of spooky these song ready to go almost feels like a sinister take on what the band cake might do if you completely strip away the band's typical knack for groove also not much in the way of interesting lyrics on this track which I think should be more of a key factor in the appeal of this album given just how dreary the record tries to be you can only hope for lyrics that bring the sadness the emotional intensity of this album home so the listener can kind of relate to it feel the impact of that but instead we get lyrics like it's an illusion this admiration of mutilation my isolation it's an illusion this admiration manipulation my isolation my isolation my isolation it's an illusion the illusion being really like an illusion of substance and not just the lyrics falter on this record but again also the vocals as I mentioned earlier which in some instances on here just really fail to sell these tracks like on these spotlit love's the only way which clears out a lot of space you would hope in this context the vocals would really come out and kill it I know Cage the Elephant doesn't you know typically feature super flashy vocals or anything like that but you should at least get an emotional performance on this cut no instrumentally it's easily one of the most dramatic tracks on the LP and I think a pained or a harrowing vocal performances is kind of needed here here the vocals don't really appeal neither do they on the deadpan verses of wars over which features these sickening hooks where the band really continues to I don't know lay these very weird expectations at the feet of this very general sense of love you can build your walls love will tear it down you can hide your heart inside a man-made house you can build your walls build them to the sky one day you'll find love was on both sides the war is over I mean it's a cute aspirational sentiment but ultimately it doesn't communicate all that much I was really left hanging on this record granted I didn't go into it with super high hopes as the teaser material again just felt very bland and average to me and Cage the Elephant have definitely evolved past at this point the meat and potatoes pop centric garage rock that put them on the map in the first place but in a lot of ways I feel like things have come full circle for the band in that they're working with a new sound now but what they're delivering is is honestly almost as boilerplate now it's just kind of Moody shimmery vaguely psychedelic pop rock that kind of reminds me of like the last Black Keys record how bland and boring and uninspired and basically ineffective that album was sure there's some very cool and chilly atmospheres on this thing some warm bass lines and crisp drums some lovely touches of strings and extra instrumentation on here it's all produced very well and no denying that and there are a few songs on here that actually are kind of compelling for all of its flaws I do like the intro cut on here quite a bit the song ready to let go has one of the most solid vocal melodies on the entire record the chorus bursts beautifully and skin and bones in my view is easily the most emotionally potent cut on the entire record the lyrical visuals of rolling with trauma and trying to move past it and tucking and rolling at the sign of danger or threat I was pretty interesting and I think was a very hard-hitting take away from this song and this record generally though I do find social cues to be severely lacking when it comes to style and character persona performance songwriting and lyrical substance again obviously this album is inspired by some dark times but for whatever reason the band has somehow managed to shield the listener from any and all of that trauma on the surface this record sounds very dark but it has little to no emotional impact as it seems like the goal at the end of the day was still to write a very breezy easy to put on rock record that you don't really need to think that intently about I think there will be quite a few caged fans attracted to this LP given its backstory given its kind of cohesive direction and mood but beyond those surface level elements I didn't really find much that was appealing or stunning about this record I'm feeling a light two decent five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a another video for you to check out hit that up or the only two subscribe to the channel

DmTgW_sjTG0,ah hi everyone know that he sleep Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the dos Manos record DOS City this is the debut full-length album from an experimental hip-hop outfit hailing from Japan these guys have been building a small buzz for themselves over in Europe and the Far East they actually started in a television miniseries that they actually soundtracked as well and of course it would take a label as weird as death bomb Ark over here in the States to say hey let's let's let's release this group's music that's what we want to do I must warn my audience though many of you including myself will be hitting a language barrier when listening to this album yes the group does rap in a mix of Japanese and English but it is very much mostly Japanese however I would argue anyone listening to this record that does not speak Japanese there is still a very deep appeal for this LP coming out of the instrumentals the unique sound that the group generates on this thing they sit pretty firmly in a 90s hip-hop hardcore hip-hop jazz rap aesthetic the likes of DJ Premier and wu-tang and Redman and A Tribe Called Quest as well as the roots seem to have a pretty profound influence on the sound of this record but dos Manos have taken the sounds of these chunky beats these jazz samples these aggressive rap flows and evolved them into something truly experimental cacophonous and weird though still there are a lot of aspects of the group's music that I think could be appreciated from sort of like an old head perspective the track theater D which happens in the first leg of the album features some pretty great flows from each member some great group chemistry but as the track progresses the beat and the vocals are kind of unexpectedly touched up with all these weird psychedelic embellishments and also these strange metallic hits of percussion kind of popping their way in here and there it's like being caught up in a very alien but totally exciting wind of sound or watching a really badass action movie in another language I may not get some of the subtle Platt points that may run throughout the movie but because of the genre I'm already somewhat familiar with the form I know it to expect and I can still see tons of explosions and ass-kicking happening in every direction plus the lighting and the editing and the cinematography and the color correction are all really good the madness that you hear on theater D pretty much continues through the rest of the project I would say that dos Manos really only falter when they fail to let a great idea pan all the way out by cutting it short or going too mild on a track like Agharta which in a lot of respects feels like very meat and potatoes hardcore hip-hop to me just in another language there are also some points here where maybe some of the flows and deliveries come off a bit too over-the-top a bit too goofy or cartoonish or take the track 20xx where I don't think the group do enough to put a spin on there very obvious influences as the flows and the instrumental on this track just very much sound like a straight play out of the RZA playbook this song really does sound like a wu-tang clunker picked up off the cutting room floor and just like turned into an album track the song clean your nerves though works with pretty much the same reference points but has better flows a beat that is absolutely pummeling feels like 12 pianos are being dropped on top of me at once with a whole horn section as well meanwhile a bunch of reversed rap verses are being thrown at me in every direction the song Bacchus is similarly overwhelming but for different reasons the be on this thing sounds like the group are sampling all this old jazz and incidental music from the golden years of television and the sound palate the background keeps switching and changing and shifting like somebody's constantly changing the channels these songs schizoid and oddly enough sounds like what I think schizophrenia would sound like if personified in a hip hop song with its doubled and jumbled vocals its dissonant relentless and tangled instrumental so there are a lot of bear mental and exciting and very creative ideas on this record flying in all directions however I do feel like the noisiness the cacophony of this group it does over time in the tracklist kind of become a crutch they pretty much paint themselves into a corner with it like on abdication before he dies where I mean the group sound just becomes utterly predictable there really are handful of tracks on here where unfortunately the group doesn't really add much to the tracklist outside of a vague sense of deja vu and again it's not so much to do with the language barrier here as much as it has to do with the group constantly favoring very similar instrumental builds and flows so while dos Manos his sound is very idiosyncratic and very distinct and very specific it's not incredibly varied at this point anyway still it's a pretty good album though it is complex it's charming it's confusing it's about 35 minutes long so it's not really over staying it's welcome and most likely the experience you have with this album will be unlike the experience you have with any other hip-hop album for the rest of 2019 I can guarantee that so if you want to hear something that is supremely strange and simultaneously celebrates and mutates the sounds of hardcore hip-hop 90s hip-hop then give this thing a listen I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please

Y1Dau-ard8I,hi hi hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well it is time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and worst tracks of the week remember that this segment is sponsored by the good people over at the orig wallet they make these fantastic RFID blocking metal plated wallets replace your disgusting bulky leather

that's me also shout-out to our Amazon and turntable lab associate links down below you can hit up those links especially that turntable ab1 get some colorful vinyl of some records we have reviewed on the channel we get kickback from it and I also want to give a shout out to some Kurt Vile Spotify singles that have dropped specifically a Rolling Stones cover that we have linked down below along with all the other tracks we are talking about in this segment so worst tracks of the week believe it or not there were quite a few this was not a particularly great week for music I mean look there were a lot of songs as you'll see later in the segment that we're very good this week very entertaining songs but some of the biggest tracks to drop this week were some of the worst and most awful first off Tyga has dropped a boring drab run-of-the-mill uninteresting new single titled goddamn it's about as bland and by-the-numbers and completely devoid of anything memorable as Tyga's music usually is this this track doesn't even really have that strong of a chorus to it you know you could at least say some of his recent works that have blown up at least had you know some good music videos with tons of asses shakin in every direction but this new single over here is really kind of lacking a kind of hard hanging groove that would I don't know even excite someone to move there but even a little but moving on from their modest mouth has dropped another single from this forthcoming album and Isaac Brock is striking out once again on this new track title I'm still here last record last single sounded like a 10-car pileup a bunch of alternative rock and pop genres that should not be mixing this new track over here is just kind of like very boring run-of-the-mill lo-fi garage rock which is is stylistically not really Isaac's strong suit frankly appreciate that he tried it I guess but it sounds like a total mess to me moving on from there Madonna has a brand new single with a maluma and an artist prior to this track I'm unfamiliar with I admit but still Madonna's very touched up and underwhelming voice on this thing is just pretty much riding a very bland Latin pop instrumental she's just trying to cash in on the current popularity of Latin pop at the moment and I don't know there's not really much to comment on beyond that there's not really a whole lot of substance to this track sadly oh and here's a doozy the worst song of the week look everyone it's the worst song of the week it's actually so bad it might be the worst song of the month and depending on how the rest of the year plays out it could potentially be the worst song of the year it's this new little Dicky song titled earth where it's just a cavalcade of celebrities lined up just making a bunch of dumb proclamations like some of the stupidest moments out of Dickies collaborative track with Chris Brown where you have just you know random celebrities popping on a saying oh I'm a raccoon I'm a squirrel I'm a squirrel I'm trying to get my next nut whoo and it's it's supposed to be this track that's I guess about loving the earth and loving the environment but it's yeah it's a total jerk-off fest that's completely pointless and stupid and inane and assumes its audience is nearly brain-dead like this I guess environmentalist pop rap song does little to nothing I would actually say absolutely nothing in terms of addressing the environmental issues our planet and we as a species currently face doesn't really address any of the underlying contributors to those problems doesn't really propose or address any solutions it's kind of like we love the earth we love the earth not not like you know paraphrasing there we love the earth oh I'm a bore oh I'm a zebra I'm black and white oh I'm this animal oh I'm that animal like as a song compositionally it's total shit as a joke song it's not even funny as an environmentalist message or credo it communicates little to nothing there's really nothing redeeming about this tract it just sucks it just sucks it might again be the worst song of the year not only because again as just a song on its own there's there's really nothing to it and as far as like a message or an idea or a concept it doesn't really bring anything substantive to the table so yeah it's just garbage moving on from there there's also a pretty new garbage track from French Montana featuring little TJ and blue-faced where the instrumentals a total mess especially with this random g-funk beats which at one point French Montana's flows just bite a little TJ's vocals on the track are horrendous and difficult to listen to I would say the only redeeming factor on the whole song is actually blue face but he comes in toward the very end and it's it's not even like the best guest verse to you that he's ever laid down so moving on from there oh and this how can we forget about this a new Beck track featuring her or at least Pharrell took part in the track and the this one is titled saw lightning and I don't know in a way I guess I could appreciate Beck instrumentally is kind of trying to go back to his quirky roots by bringing together these elements of rock and pop and country and hip hop into a kind of funky and strange mix but man is the production on this thing clunky and not very fulfilling man is Beck songwriting on this track lackluster he refrains that he lays all over this song are utterly ridiculous and I don't know if some of his silly is silliest and most unlikable in a long long time in a way this track almost makes me miss when he was just making boring music because at least you could say that had some some maturity to it on the writing side of things but yeah not really feeling this one sadly all right let's move on to the tracks I was kind of met on this week you know wasn't blown away by them they but they were certainly worth pointing out certainly worth pointing you toward first off we have this brand-new track over here with smoke purp featuring production from Kenny beats and Boys Noize beat goes hard smoked purp sounds kind of Savage on the song but overall it just kind of sounds like another very aggressive piece of SoundCloud rap that is really just kind of spinning its wheels in the mud moving on from there Seb addo has another new track out if you are into a very winding and somewhat abstract indie rock that's kind of heavy and a little hard-hitting I think you will like this single I love their last one a little bit more but this new one over here raging river is quality as well also health has collaborated with Ghost main on a brand new track I am loving that the industrial noise pop outfit is continuing their string of collaborations that they have been making a lot of noise with over the past like half a year or so maybe a little bit longer this new one with ghost main is another hip-hop oriented one all the way I've never really been a big ghost main fan I think partially the reason that is is due to the strange I don't know pitch shifts in his voice on this track some of the nasally passages on this song are kind of laughable and some of the some vocals on here some of the screen vocals just come off really melodramatic and I don't really care for it all that much but hey you know if ghost Mane is your thing you'll most likely enjoy hearing him over a more industrial heavier somewhat more experimental backdrop because health certainly provides that moving out from there full of Hell has a brand new track out which hope I'm pronouncing correctly Sylmar assume aural tomorrow again not a term I familiar with or anything like that but it is a very brutal grinding hard-hitting disgusting track that kind of just breezes by in one minute it's kind of a blur unfortunately outside of some of the weird slow cro-magnon crushing riffs and and the breakdown after like the second half of the song but um but that point in the the track I wasn't really that impressed with maybe it'll blow me away a bit more in the context of the record but just is kind of like a standalone one-minute cut it's kind of hard to get like a you know a real feel of the track unfortunately but still you know full of hell new record on the way they sound just as nasty as ever Fox agente brand new track this week titled work which I feel like I'm a little on the fence with because I'm still making heads or tails of it a bit there were some elements of I think like maybe some old-school hard rock and New Wave that might have been mixed into this track but the mixing and the way the lead vocals and the background vocals synced up just feels so clunky and awkward like the instrumentation and the vocals really aren't gelling all that well obviously at this point given Oxygen's knack for production and songwriting on previous efforts you know I I assume anything that ends up on a fox agenda record is just you know intentional at this point but maybe the the genius of this somewhat more abstract and coughin is a way of mixing this track together is is eluding me at the moment I guess but as of right now I'm just kind of left scratching my head wondering why it just kind of sounds like you know a bit of a tangled a bit of a tangled mess moving on from there Flying Lotus has a new album on the way and it's gonna be a pretty lengthy one and two T's toward this record he has seen fit to drop a spoken-word track featuring David Lynch which isn't exactly like the kind of futuristic hip-hop infused and jazz infused production that we know Flying Lotus for it's just kind of a strange very cinematic weird disturbing bit of soundtrack music with David Lynch on top telling a very odd story and and I there are a lot of elements about it that I like but I don't know I'm hoping that I end up enjoying the more I guess music oriented songs are more compositionally intensive songs a bit more I mean it's it's a good taster it's a good teaser but not exactly an exciting single I'm gonna be playing over and over and over until the album's out moving on from their cupcake has seen fit to drop a remix of frickin Old Town Road little nas ex I love a lot of cupcakes bars on this track but the way that her voice was chorused and doubled up on the song made it completely obnoxious and almost impossible to listen to again I probably would hear it again just to kind of get some more of the bars and just to you know sort of laugh at a lot of a cupcake is saying on the the track which is incredibly explicit you know it is cupcake but again I think the the mixing of this track in the way the vocals were handled really kind of kneecapped the full potential of the remix moving on from there oh seven Oh shake has dropped a few singles as well and Mauro and nice to have are the tracks in question and yeah you know it's it's it's very sterile very beat centric and Spacey art pop shakes vocals didn't really stunned me on this record as much as it had when she was kind of crossing over with Kanye sort of wondering where exactly her music is moving at this point but the moment I have an opinion on what she's gonna be putting out into the future I will sort of make sure to throw it out there and let's move on to the tracks that I thought were the best best this week belly you guys valet your America you guys remember this guy gave a review to his little EP that he dropped not too long ago and it was it was quite negative as what exactly this dudes appeal was just wasn't really coming through on that project you and me both though lyrically doesn't really seem to be I guess diverting from what we've heard him rap about up until this point I mean material things fashion clothing so on and so forth however the very minimal and low-key delivery and flow on this track combined with the somewhat experimental and weird trap beat actually makes for a pretty interesting list and I like this track quite a bit moving on from there st. vitus the legendary doom metal outfit has dropped a song called useless which is one minute and 34 seconds shockingly and it is like a crossover between just a heavy metal and hardcore punk you know think like if Motorhead was trying to write the scuzziest most disgusting hardcore punk song imaginable with some very low Phi and very gruesome production that's that's kind of what this track is vibing like and I love it it's it's actually a big surprise from Saint Vitus frankly moving out from there Mavis Staples has dropped another track that is pretty fantastic any time is the name of this new one and it is a very soulful plea a piece of blues rock that has some great backup vocals a very rustic but quality production as well Mavis --is vocal performances is very enjoyable let me see moving on from there we have another track from Kevin Moore be who I shouted out in a previous episode of the weekly track roundup for a new single that sounded like a very odd take on the sounds of Lou Reed this new one over here this new single Oh gee rock-and-roll is another track where Kevin enjoyably is just in a very absurd fashion turning rock and roll inside out and I love his kind of weird tongue-in-cheek approach to reviving the sound of this genre and I don't know I'm just like really pleased and impressed with the results so far just kind of seems like a really creative take on you know the classic sounds of rock music and just kind of updating it for a very weird era Kevin abstract has dropped another single from his album that he's kind of like dropping in pieces we had the Arizona baby single and now we have this ghetto baby EP and then that's going to kind of culminate into another project that is dropping very soon while dropping this week pretty much I have you know been enjoying everything for the most part that he's dropped up until this point with a few exceptions of songs that are low underwhelming to me and this new track baby boy of this latest batch of songs is easily my favorite beautiful ballad and wonderful mix of R&B and singer-songwriter music and pop and hip hop basically that very unique blend of sounds and styles that made Kevin's American boyfriend so special all come together on this track over here amazing vocal feature from Kevin Beatty Orion Beatty excuse me I'm thinking Kevin abstract in my head so I thought Kevin Ryan Beatty on this track and he just sounds phenomenal on the cuts very passionate beautiful song lavish production as well Kevin not only with Rimmel has Jack Antonoff of bleachers Fame in the fold on the production here so of course the song is sounding immaculate as a result of that so really loving this track really really loving this single very impressed with it moving on from there we have a brand new injury reserve song to Karuna and lime it is a lyrical odd quirky banger that kicks off the trio's latest full-length album which is dropping very soon and you can expect a review out for that as soon as that comes out so beat on the look out for that bubble I am and oh also a shout out to this wonderful new for Tet song teenage bird song which seems to see Karen Hebden going back to his days where he was kind of fusing um you know not only uh electronic beats and and sort of influences from the worlds of house and techno together but also like some acoustic noises and some more natural and I guess kind of I don't know we're organic tones and Tambor's in what he's doing and it's again it's kind of beautiful to hear him kind of go back in that direction again because I think the results are pretty fantastic again on this teenage bird song track moving on from there we have the Flaming Lips a song has been dropped onto the Internet as a single from their new record which I guess was dropped as a small run vinyl release this past Record Store Day so they're our Flaming Lips fans out there with this Flaming Lips record in their hands which I guess is going to see a wider release in July and this track over here is a very beautiful piece of experimental psychedelic folk good balladry at the core of the song very pretty and compelling vocals of the eerie atmosphere of the track - it is pretty it is unsettling it is Flaming Lips and also want to give a shout out to this new earth track over here was a little underwhelmed by the project's last single for its forthcoming album but this new one the color of poison is actually kind of unique for Dylan Carlson and the gang the kind of start/stop guitar licks on this one certainly make it a very weird and odd stand out in the earth discography especially since up until this point droning and just giving the audience as much consistent sound as possible has sort of been Earth's MO and now they really kind of break that up at a very creative fashion on this new track over here that is pretty stimulating even if some of the riffs are a little meat and potatoes and predictable for Earth alright Carly Rae Jepsen has dropped a brand new single as well new album on the way Julian is the name of this new one and it's definitely I think my favorite so far from this coming albums cycle it's a pretty sweet piece of synth pop with a very modern production background behind it very punchy very sweet very nice on the ears and that has been it for our weekly track roundup everybody remember all of the tracks that I talked about in this video are linked down below you are the best shout out once more to the ridge for sponsoring this series this segments link down below for them and as I already said link down below for all the songs too and we'll see you in the next one Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever bah bah 
5E205mcp6g8,hi everyone nice a need a tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Aries record welcome home this is a brand new collection of tracks from singer songwriter producer and YouTube content creator Aries you may not be aware of this guy if you're not deep into the YouTube music Oh fear but this dude hosts a pretty popular series where he recreates a lot of very popular hip-hop beats from scratch within a certain span of time he obviously makes his own music on the side as well though it's something that's never really stopped me in my tracks up until this point however I did get some suggestions to listen to his new album over here I was kind of curious given that I've enjoyed his content in the past so gave it a shot and surprisingly it's it's pretty good going into this I didn't really know what to expect other than I thought it was most likely going to be hip-hop influenced given what of area stuff I've heard in the past we have 9 tracks and 25 minutes of runtime on this project and it delivers a pretty sweet and clean blend of moody modern trap some emo a little bit of pop and some singer-songwriter music either inadvertently or totally on purpose Ares has miraculously crafted a pretty decent contribution to the current wave of emo trap and emo rap music I think he does a great job of bringing these two genres and worlds together without necessarily boiling his combination down to the most basic and derivative and gimmicky elements of each and it's kind of funny given this style this sound has been rising to a simmer for a little while now and then all of a sudden this dude comes out of left field on YouTube and whoa he's actually crafting some pretty compelling and substantive and introspective songs set to trap beats as well as pianos guitars and since Ares vocal delivery is also pretty melancholic and smooth I think on this project Ares does a pretty decent job of sidestepping the tracklist bloat and the depression glorification as well as the unnecessary edginess that I think is play this style up until this point and it feels weird saying this but I can't help but comment that some of the best tracks on this thing feel like what Russ's music would sound like if it wasn't so no bye-bye I'm not listening to this bye when listening to this I'm also reminded of artists like Post's Malone because I see his work in a similar light in that post is very much a singer/songwriter at heart who is using these modern trends in hip-hop and pop music at large to just kind of get his songwriting across Aries is very much in the same boat as there are plenty of tracks on this thing that you could easily transcribe over to an acoustic context or performance the vibe of this project overall is pretty easygoing and chill even if it is a bit dreary however this does not stop the hooks and the vocal lines on this thing from popping there are a lot of lyrics on this project about missing people love on the rocks texting blacking out drinking or taking pills to kind of take you our woes or your emotional pain away in the grander scheme of hip hop and emote rap right now nothing altogether new it's a little tortured kind of melodramatic and occasionally gets overly sentimental lyrically a little corny at points though I will say the somber tone of the record and the very slick presentation of the instrumentation does take the edge off of that quite a bit I would actually argue the appeal of this record is so immediate and so sweet to the ear that the darkness of the lyrics may not be apparent right away some of the quick snappy and sad highlights for me on this project are cuts like sayonara with its twang and twinkly guitars right at the start of the track which sound like they are lifted right out of an emo song eventually the track transitions into some cute little dusty lead melodies and a steady trap beat and Aries produced a really hypnotic beat on this one it's amazing how memorizing it is especially when the flow on his hook pops in not enough move it to the side run around Never the song deity also stood out to me but where's this track coming from where is this song coming from the way Aries sings on the hook of this track it sounds like something out of a very radio-friendly alternative metal song from like 15 years ago the prominent acoustic guitar on this track also leads me to believe that this is kind of like a key influence here the verses on this track also seemed like something weekend fans would really really love with an extra heaping helping of angst thrown in for good measure I can't exactly look at some of this stuff the lyrics I mean and relate some of it really doesn't resonate with me as I've never really been where wanted to be a moody poet lothario gossiper but I will say between the production and his vocal delivery Aries is certainly very good at making this world his music exists within seem like his own personal hell it's certainly to the point where the track Amy's great which is a very despondent track on this album features these lines of take me away take me away why should I care what happens to me I don't know even though these phrases may not seem all that profound poetically Aries gives them I think a certain amount of poetic weight in just how serious these proclamations feel it's at this point where I think the quality of the project begins to trail off a little bit though the song Pony I found to be kind of lackluster in comparison with how accessible and instantly catchy many of the other tracks in the tracklist are on top of that I thought the vocals were a bit more washed out than they were on every other cut here carousel in Santa Monica aesthetically and instrumentally are also decent moments here but these songs at this point on the record are either feeling so breezy or almost like Aries is kind of painting himself into a corner his flows his topical focus the melodies that he tends to favor there's not a whole lot of variety or contrast again maybe that's because this is such a short and kind of an inaugural project for him he's very clearly still developing his sound whatever that is going to be even within this pretty short run time though the well does begin to run dry as it just begins to feel like I'm listening two very similar lyrical and melodic and rhythmic ideas just sort of worked at different angles the closing track on here though even though I'm not crazy about it I do admire it for getting kind of ambitious and trying to end this project off on a high note the glistening pianos at the start of the track along with the vocals almost feel like something out of a Coldplay song eventually the track reaches a very powerful and almost cinematic vocal climax but almost immediately after that the track kind of fizzles out and just disappears in a way it feels like it was in a rush to be over even though it's the longest song on the entire record overall welcome home I think is a pretty sweet project and a record that I think should be acknowledged as a decent contribution again to this current wave of emo trap and singer-songwriter based hip-hop music but going forward I would love to hear Aires mix it up a little bit in the production I would love to hear more texture more teeth more adventure the vocals occasionally are a bit too one-dimensional and underwhelming like on the opening cut here when Ares does hit a vocal high and he reaches into his upper register or gives a very passionate or a compelling performance it's great it's just not the case though for every track here and as far as the songwriting goes while I do love the catchy ER and the more to the point songs on this record if you're ever gonna build a larger more ambitious project out you're gonna need more dimensions more phases welcome-home is a pretty likeable project and something I think is going to have me kind of keeping my ears on Aries for a little bit just to see where he moves next even if again it's not blowing me away from front to back there are some amazing songs in the tracklist here I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i

Ijny2633SIE,hi everyone qui ne it tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Anderson pack Record Ventura this is the latest full-length album from singer songwriter multi-instrumentalist producer from Anderson don't forget the dot pack we just heard from this man toward the end of 2018 with his last full-length album Oxnard a dr. dre backed project that was one of my favorites of that year I loved the vintage and cinematic and colorful production on this thing the super catchy songwriting the fantastic feature list which led to some incredible performances from Kendrick Lamar as well as push a tee there were also some very weird and entertaining detours in the tracklist on this thing like who are you as well as six summers and given that Anderson pack musically is a bit of a jack-of-all-trades this thing featured a pretty wide array of influences from funk and soul to contemporary hip hop and R&B now I get that there is a contingent of Anderson PAC fans who prefer his 2016 album Malibu to Oxnard I get it but in my opinion Oxnard is just so great in to the point pound-for-pound I view it as the more focused and ambitious album and Anderson seems to be striking while the iron is hot with a new full record of music less than a year later and he's teased to the release of this album by saying it's it's more of a soul centric project now given that it's Anderson pack and soul music has pretty much inspired everything he's done up until this point how much of a sea change is that really going to be I mean not only does the material on this record also have dr. Dre's fingerprints on it but it sounds like it was recorded and conceptualized and written in the same headspace that all of Oxnard's material was - but the difference being that many tracks on this record do actually slide further to the soul side of the Anderson pack music spectrum and have a mellower presentation as well so if you are being a totally uncharitable jerk you could look at this record and say isn't this just leftovers isn't this just Oxnard leftovers but we're not going to do that because there's no real reason to complain about another consistent entertaining Anderson album there's not now look I'm not trying to say this is a perfect record or anything like that there are a handful of moments that really do underwhelm and disappoint like the musical bridge to nowhere that good heels is or the incredibly awkward instrumental transition after an amazing first leg on the track reaching to much the soft faint and smooth soul passage this track eventually shifts into is kind of awkward at points a lot of Anderson packs vocal embellishments on this track come off a bit weird not to mention they're a few head-scratching lyrics I see you too much baby I need to take some space you kiss me too much baby forgot to wipe my face uh ooh that's gross what are you in spit all over your face what maybe some lipstick though that doesn't really seem to be successfully conveyed here I mean the track starts great but it misses the landing and the song chosen one I see almost as like a flip of that with the constant beat embellishments in the first leg of this track the random rushes of synthetic tones as well as Sonya Elise's very strong vocal lines this song is like a confusing ten-car pileup of sound it's got a lot of noise but it's not composed all that cleanly thankfully the track does eventually clear up into some irresistible EQ piano chords some funky grooves and beats some really sick bars and rap flows from Anderson packs some hilarious lyrical nods to MF doom as well as Sailor Moon but I think my least favorite track on this entire album most definitely comes down to Twilight mostly because the instrumental on this cut is absolutely awful with this soul-sucking kick and snare pattern it just simply goes back back back back sure there are some twittering percussive embellishments throughout that beat but it is very groove 'less and stiff also the fake horn line on this cut gets really corny - also the bow bah bah bah bah rubbery bassline it sounds like a horrible Pharrell ripoff and then of course I went into the production credits of this album and saw Pharrell actually made it look Pharrell is a great guy fantastic artist and I know every beat he makes is not going to be the best beat in the world but he could have easily given this instrumental to Justin Timberlake for it to be completely forgotten for the rest of eternity on his last record he could have at least done that Anderson pack did not deserve this B he should have gotten a way better beat because it's so frickin tedious and I feel like Anderson pack vocally he does his best on top of the track he does what he can do on top of it but the song itself he's singing comes off super tedious because I think he's working within the confines of this very repetitive instrumental unfortunately thankfully the highlights on this record outshine for the most part the moments here there's the silky and gorgeous kickoff to the entire album featuring Andre 3000 come home great start to this thing also evokes the same classic vintage era of soul and and soundtrack music that Oxnard was pulling from I love the Airy background vocals on this thing the light touches of guitar and percussion I also love the strings on this cut the glamorous pianos the nimble bass line the sense of longing the Anderson pack delivers on the hook of this track is deep it is thick I also love the meta commentary that he works into the hook of a nobody even begs anymore and as if the track wasn't already good enough on its own and it is I mean it could have easily slipped into the tracklist on Oxnard and been great but on top of that again you get this Andre 3000 performance which is killer the way he switches his flow up on the song is amazing his delivery is incredible and the wet twat harriet tubman line in his verse proves him to be still to this day one of the most eccentric rappers and writers out there the song make it better featuring Smokey Robinson sure the instrumental here is a bit basic especially from the standpoint of the drums but Anderson packs kind of raspy and expressive and golden voice delivers a wonderful classic soul tune on this one I love the sentiment of this track of kind of going through a tumultuous time in a relationship and then want to get back to a good time a good place wanting to make more memories it's absolutely feel-good and blissful and lovely and romantic we get even more romance on the track winner's circle which features some gorgeous jazzy chord changes some breaks on the track that feature vocals scatting which you don't hear a whole lot of these days but comes off really well on this record doubt about it Babette on the song King James you see a very sharp blend of synth funk and hip-hop nothing all too new for Anderson but I do love the socially aware and politically charged lyrics on this track the nods and the lyrics to gentrification as well as black culture colin kaepernick and painting LeBron James as a leader and important social figure who has used his success in the NBA to help others in his community and become this symbol for change given the beat on this thing the tone of the lyrics Anderson packs very charismatic vocal delivery the song has more sting than any other in the track listing the song jet black is yet another quality soul tune on here with a quality hook bit of R&B blended into the mix and Anderson does have some good vocal chemistry with none other than brandy of all people who appears on this song I have not heard her out of track in a long time but who I haven't heard from in an even longer time is actually Nate Dogg for obvious reasons rest in peace who appears on the last track on this record via some unreleased vocals undoubtedly dr. Dre may have been kind of the plug on that and for Anderson on this track that was actually a lot of material to work with in terms of these Nate Dogg vocals there is a full chorus here there's a full verse here there's actually even some studio banter that he works in afterwards to make it seem as if they're kind of naturally and casually interacting after the song al Kendrick Lamar Tupac on to pimp a butterfly and the tune on this track is so incredible and so solid what can we do what can we do what can we do such a lovely and feel-good send-off to the entire album it brings this album to a wonderful moment of finality not only because it's it's just such a solid and beautiful song but also you know that given Nate Dogg was one of the most essential voices of the 90s and just Anderson PACs overall style and delivery Nate has undoubtedly been a huge huge huge influence on this man sound on this man's music and the way that he so wonderfully interacts with these vocals and and takes so much care in the performance and the craft of this song getting a little teary-eyed thinking of it you know you could really tell the Anderson pack just so did not want to mess this up wanted it to be great wanted to not only just function as a great song on its own but also just be a great tribute to Nate Dogg as a singer and as a performer I could really feel sort of like the love that he has for him as an artist as he was kind of like you know performing along with these vocals and just kind of doing what he was doing on this track it was actually like really great and really moving at it so you know it says a lot I think it says a lot so yeah it was really it's really great ending to the out really great ending to the album so overall it is a very solid record I will say once more I do prefer Oxnard mostly because there are like a handful of somewhat malformed moments on this record but the highlights that are on here they are very very very high and I also think it speaks very much to Anderson packs abilities as an artist that he can come together with a record of songs that are essentially left over from his last big studio session for his last big record and you could pull all these tracks together and make another very good album I am feeling a decent 7 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well or over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Anderson PAC Ventura forever 
l5ZD6BYKrGY,hi everyone freshly greens tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Chemical Brothers album no geography this is the ninth full-length album from the legendary electronic music duo The Chemical Brothers who were responsible for creating some of the most memorable essential and groundbreaking electronic music and big beat of the 90s The Chemical Brothers back catalogue has become pretty classic at this point exit planet dust surrender dig your own hole but like many artists who became wildly popular in the 90s The Chemical Brothers had sort of struggled to stay cutting-edge and relevant in the 2000s you can't say they were trying though like on their record we are the night which features some pretty trippy productions some nocturnal vibes some very weird vocal performances and clips it's not like during this era The Chemical Brothers weren't experimenting but quite a few tracks that landed on albums that came out during this era didn't exactly bang and soar like the duo's most classic material even though the Chemical Brothers discography got kind of tumultuous in the 2000s I do think the duo's more recent material has marked a bit of a return to basics sure it doesn't sound exactly like the old days but the duo's last fooling with LP born in the echoes did feature some pretty great vocalists and the kind of gargantuan beats and hooks that put the duo on the map in the first place and I think the Chemical Brothers continued on that road with this new LP over here no geography it feels like with the duo's back catalogue reaching classic status there is more of a demand for them to just do what they do best I was kind of concerned going into this LP though because a few of the teaser tracks and singles I thought were some of the worst that The Chemical Brothers have put out in a while for yourself as well as mad as hell as long as I brought these tracks up I might as well mention all of the low points on the album in my opinion so again the song mad as hell it does feature some great groove switches some heavy punchy production some thumping kicks and the track builds up some great tension like a classic piece of acid house but the full potential of this track I think is marred in some very basic and and formulaic progressions also a very gimmicky vocal sample from the El Coco song I'm mad as hell which seems pretty quirky and strange within the original disco and funk context of the song but on this bang an electronic beat it just mostly sounds annoying I think it also contributes to the song feeling kind of one-dimensional because this vocal snippet is not really enough to carry through the entire track and keep it entertaining the vocals are also less than desirable on the track free yourself the numerous deadpan refrains all over the song of free yourself free me dance what they contribute to the track I'm not entirely sure they go pretty stale pretty fast but in my opinion the track doesn't truly kneecap itself until the chemical brothers toss in these horrid layers of whooping synth leads ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba they're all cascading over each other it sounds like I'm standing in the middle of like a murder of crows like five dozen crows and they're all calling at once the synths are just as perplexing on the track the universe sent me where the duo throws in once again these synth layers that are kind of fluttering thrown on top of each other to the point where they just make a cacophony a total mess you can't really make heads or tails of it it's kind of fluttery a little disorienting and not really in an exciting or a visceral way it just really comes off like an unfulfilled jumble of sound meanwhile the faint and lifeless lead vocals that play throughout the track don't really do the song much justice either it just kind of I don't know feels like a fusion of art pop electro Seiken bad trip-hop these song gravity drops overall is is fine it's one of the more tolerable tracks on the track list here but given its lack of progression and overall excitement it just kind of comes off like an overextended interlude the track catch me I'm falling is a glassy and kind of epic finisher on here very futuristic and tone loaded with reverb loaded with atmosphere or rather it's very atmospheric the tune and the production on this one reads like a cross between a Bjork tune and a gorilla's tune I think the song would be a bit more fulfilling as a sobering tie-up if the lead-up to this had been maybe just a bit less rocky thankfully he started this record is relatively strong I guess multiple epic bangers on this leg of the album linked into each other carrying the momentum of the entire album and tracklist really well I would even argue that these links and this momentum carry through songs that I don't even really enjoy that much on the record but I still do appreciate the duo took this approach where they made the album experience a bit more holistic still to mention some of the highlights on this thing you have the killer Eve of Destruction kicking the entire album off amazing plucky bass line on this thing fantastic revving noises building up some great changes on this track a hustling disco beat a very shouty female lead vocal Allah and old-school punk tune a robot vocal Allah Daft Punk a singer and a vocal line on the pre-chorus that sounds like something out of an old soul song that's incorporated in a way that is very similar to that of a classic Chicago House track so on this track in particular I am loving the wide array of influences and how successfully The Chemical Brothers are essentially fusing them all together so they complement one another you have the song Bango which is even groovier with its panoramic percussion and kind of odd deadpan vocal leads delivered by Norwegian singer Aurora the title track on this thing is also a highlight for me it's got a pretty large and cinematic sound to it with these punchy beats and utopian synthesizers vocal clips that inspire feelings of togetherness and unity across all mankind and in a lot of ways I see it as a logical conclusion to a lot of the most classic stuff Kraftwerk dropped back in the day there's also the track we've got to try which is a very heavy and hard-hitting fusion of disco and soul and acid house I love the vintage vocal breaks the duo are able to kind of weave into the beats on this one love these sharp textured squelchy synth leads that are very prominent throughout this cut too so yeah there are some very strong highlights on this record some great tracks they're really called back to the best years of The Chemical Brothers career however there are a good deal of songs on this thing as well that I see as merely being tolerable not really all that stand out and there are a few duds in the tracklist - I appreciate that the duo didn't overextend themselves on this one or anything really my greatest issue with this LP is that there are a lot of very odd decisions that are really ruining tracks that should have been as solid as the first leg of the record with synth lines and synth passages that are literally so horrendous they pretty much ruin the song - vocal clips and appearances that just don't really inspire much of anything I would argue that they take away much more from the song than they actually add so as much as I would like to be completely hype for the Chemical Brothers at this point in their career I do kind of feel like this is yet another instance of an album past that classic era of the duo's career that is just a mixed bag I am feeling a light two DS and six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best - what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry at the Bell is well over here next to my head is

3qjNDxkAv4w,hi everyone pet the knee popped Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new pup record morbid stuff Toronto band pup is back with a new album of new material right here it is their third since exploding onto the scene back in 2013 when they were delivering a pretty meat and potatoes blend of pop punk and post hardcore and while I wasn't exactly nutso for the group's follow-up album the dream is over in comparison with the debut pups sophomore album did feature better songwriting a more explosive sound overall a greater appreciation for hooks especially on what was their best single at the time DVP however in my opinion the teaser tracks to this newest record from pop have been even better kids and sibling rivalry as well as free at last who's panicky lead vocals sound like something off of an ajj formerly Andrew Jackson jihad album all these cuts come packed with righteous riffs and anthemic guitars and snotty singing melodic lead vocals and sharp hooks it is very clear that pup has a great appreciation for the pop punk of the 90s and the 2000s and they sort of add in a splash of emo on these tracks too it's like listening to a ten car pileup of Weezer and the Dickies and the ergs and Jeff Rosen's stock as well as the men zingers even some of the guitar playing on sibling rivalry sounds lifted out of a sum 41 song but with some added grit and edge this record easily delivers pups best blend of influences and sounds yet I would still argue in the grander scheme of rock and pop punk it's not exactly the most original sound in the world but I think the snappy songwriting on this record does a lot to make up for that there's not really a snoozer in the whole tracklist on this thing nor a song where it felt like the band wasn't writing up to their full potential there are also a few genre twists and turns in the tracklist on this record that I think we're very necessary given just how one-dimensional pups last album read to me there's the track full-blown meltdown whose riffs and guitar tones are very very sludgy bordering on just straight metal music truly the heaviest cut the band has ever put out and the band puts every ounce ferocity that they have into the performance of this one track between Stefan's just throat shredding screams and and Zach's very muscular drumming this track is absolutely hard-hitting and badass it's like listening to high on fire meets pop punk these song kids isn't a total departure from pops a usual sound but the very wordy and shouted diatribes and the verses on this track are enough to give the band a bit more of a new flavor a new direction almost feels like something out of the Dead Milkmen playbook but updated tastefully for a modern pop punk audience the song city isn't a favorite of mine on the album here but the band still effectively pulls off a very low-key and sad closer to end the album off and Scorpion Hill sees pop kicking things off with a kind of a backwater country ballad that suddenly throttles into a very aggressive high-octane piece of pop punk during the more country passage of this track the band kind of sounds like the Black Lips but without as much of a I don't know weirdo appeal like the Black Lips if they were taking a lot less LSD there's also an irresistible catchy and lovably morbid chorus on this thing that I like quite a bit and needless to say the lyrics across this entire record most definitely helped this album live up to its title of morbid stuff this album may in fact be at its darkest on the track see you at your funeral which is maybe the the pettiest pop punk song ever recorded with lyrics like I hope somehow I never see you again and if I do it's at your funeral or better yet I hope the world explodes I hope that we all die we can watch all the highlights in hell I hope they're televised the song sibling rivalry is very similar in spirit in that it also focuses on someone that the protagonist is is very fed up with and we get even more dark intentions on this record with the song Bloody Mary Kate and Ashley which has one of the best hooks on the entire record its soaring its harmonious its exuberant all these huge layered shouted group vocals it is just incredible pop punk but the verses on this thing sound more like a goth rock bands wet dream the highlights continue on to the track closure which features even more great songwriting and a kind of mellow twinkly emo breakdown in the second half that's very reminiscent of American football the track also comes with one of the grandest finishes on the entire record - overall I think this is a pretty great in solid rock album again maybe not one of the most cutting edge or inventive in this particular style or genre occasionally I find the recording to be a little dry and a little plain even though it does a great job of translating the band's very electrifying performances but even after considering those shortcomings and that there may be a few tracks in the tracklist here that are just ok this is still pups best album today and maybe one of the better pop punk albums of the decade - I would also argue that with the release of this album pop has solidified themselves as one of the better and most consistent pop punk bands of this decade - as there are only maybe a few groups out there who I can think have been as consistent and as creative as pup over the years the Wonder Years the story so far choice Manor Jeff Rosenstock is probably my favorite but pup does come in at a very solid second so all things considered morbid stuff is a very great and enjoyable album and I am feeling a strong 7 - a light 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the Bell is well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana pup morbid stuff forever 
U_OBnRABSTE,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it is time for a weekly track roundup where i go over what i felt were the best and worst tracks of the week you know what it is at this point quickly I do want to shout out that I have a tour coming up this May a West Coast tour ok start of May it's coming up and the first state in Vancouver is already sold out so bye bye bye bye to that we also have dates coming up in Seattle Portland San Fran Los Angeles and San Diego linked to tickets down below I will see you guys there we have a good time Cal's gonna be there I'm gonna be there it's gonna be like a mix of memes and music and a dumb silly TED talk alright let's get into the weekly track roundup also want to shout out our amazon and a turntable lab associate links use that turntable at link we get kickback from it buy yourself some vinyl tree yo self and it's it's the worst tracks of the week let's talk about the worst tracks of the week we do have a handful we do have a handful one this new Steve Lacey track as much as I have grown quite an appreciation for Steve Lacey's work as a solo producer as a pivotal mind in the group the Internet this new single of his inside is one of the most needlessly repetitive tracks I've heard in a while to the point where it is it is truly mind-numbing there's some cool loops and grooves on this cut but not so good that I would repeat them to the extent that Steve does on this track frankly moving on from there I've already talked about my dislike of this new schoolboy q single with Travis Scott on the Fantana channel hit up that review on that channel for you know some more in-depth thoughts and everything but yeah really lackluster single school boys flow and lyrics are completely lackluster and uninteresting and boring do not know why the dude phoned it in so hard on his own tract Travis Scott delivers one of the most annoying and lopsided singles of his career really everybody is punching under their weight on this entire track even the beat is kind of generic so I'm really disappointed moving on from there a new foster the people single titled style which is just a very obnoxious generic piece of pop rock with kind of a in the edge to it but it honestly brings no soul to the song whatsoever and finally couch esta has seen fit to drop a brand new track a diss track against the one and only Anderson PAC for claiming he has the best teeth in the game when you know it's me and generally this song is bad it's corny it has a really bad beat that kind of sounds like the ZZ beat with the the steel drums on it cows bars suck and the vocal mixing sucks it's way too quiet so a lot of sucky things about the track a lot of sucky things about the song don't see why Anderson PAC would feel in the least dissed or attacked by this song I do appear on the track but I did against my own will which is why I sound so flat and unhappy on the song alright moving on from there and keep in mind that track is link down below so you can stream it along with everything else we're talking about in this video stream the song moving on from there we have a brand new track from the psyche rock outfit known as wand this new track titled Rio Grande is a Rio Grande rather is um it's it's okay it's it's one of the more low-key cuts that the band of seen fit to release in teasing toward this new album there's coming out very soon and I just found it kind of underwhelming not nearly as as tingly or engaging or as I guess adventurous as what they've been kind of building up to this new album with so far moving on from there the mountain goats have dropped a brand new track that I I kind of like The Ballad of at the core of it but I don't quite get the appeal of the instrumental which to me just sounds like the theme song to a really whole some the 80s family sitcom don't really get the instrumental direction the band is going with on this track frankly moving out from there the band the garden has dropped a brand new single thy mission featuring Mac DeMarco of all people it's got some decent vocals on it but for the most part that tune is um I don't know kind of lopsided and weird and doesn't really stick with me there's a lot of oddity and attitude to the song but the songwriting to me just kind of felt them I don't know it's not really there to be to be honest moving on from there tame impala has dropped a brand new single over here as some people are making some noise about this new one over here is titled borderline and in a lot of ways it sort of follows in suit with the last single tame impala wrote I will say that the tune at the core of the song does feel a bit more solid and has a bit more weight to it like the melody is definitely catchy or however I feel like Kevin Parker is sort of driven the band almost into a direction of anonymity with this track because the sort of glitzy and dreamy disco grooves he packs throughout this song and I know this was a comparison I drew with the last track but it really just kind of sounds like a Toro y Moi track you know now even more on this new cut than the previous one to the point where I'm just not even sure what Kevin is bringing to this sound or the style of music that Toro y Moi isn't or hasn't already I mean I guess it's kind of long and it's a sort of linear in and drainie and you kind of get lost in it but I don't know outside of the groove of the track there's not a lot about it that I'm really all that enamoured with moving on from there Pelican has dropped a brand new track if you are into some very sludgy heavy meat-and-potatoes riffs with some very easy going progressions and no vocals getting in the way or anything like that this track is titled mid nitin mescaline you might dig on this one didn't blow me away or anything but I've never been like the number one Pelican fan or anything like that moving on from there a new EP from a hip hop group that I talked about in a previous episode of review your music or reviewing your music they have a you know like I said they just dropped a new EP it's kind of spacey kind of mystical little psychedelic kind of soulful kind of weird again I remind I want to remind you the name of this particular group is new earth and this track off of the EP that I dug a little bit is a titled paradigm again with everything else we've been talking about in this video it's linked down below no name has also dropped a track I think last week song 32 I meant to talk about it then but finally getting around to it now it's just basically a pretty straightforward beat smooth low-key no name flows a lot of bars not a whole lot in terms of structure or songwriting or anything like that if you're looking for something with her just straight rapping something's kind of a vibe just a short in-and-out and that sort of thing give it a shot you know not any of her best stuff but it seems like she's just kind of like dropping these tracks out of the blue keeping people's attention on high and just kind of you know I guess keeping in touch with fans and kind of feeding the fan base hit him with more stuff hit him with more stuff hit him with more stuff moving on from there Mark Ronson has dropped a brand new single as you might remember I loved the last one that he did with Miley Cyrus from this port from this forthcoming project of his and this new one is titled late night feeling features Lykke Li and Lee's voice just does not do much for this track honestly she really kind of puts me to sleep on the song to the point where I can't even really appreciate the tune of the track all that much the production is great the production is stellar but outside of that it's it's a pretty drab cut I mean if you like your dance pop to be super whispery to the point where it is faint and barely has any flavor or to it maybe you'll dig it something to just kind of play in the background in the changing rooms at forever 21 or whatever but outside of that it's it doesn't really have a lot going for it moving on from there little Aussie vert has seen fit to drop a couple of tracks this week also talked about these over on the Fantana channel and as far as Susie goes I mean they're utterly average I mean the instrumental for one is even really not that good his flows pretty much average just very easy blueprint at this point he really brings nothing special whatsoever to both of these new tracks they're titled sanguine Paradise and and that's a rack paradise I did prefer to the two but still in the grander scheme of ooze ease discography it's it's really not that special of a track moving on from there Kevin abstract I also talked about this over on the Fantana channel his Arizona baby single which features several different tracks on it one of which is kind of a low-key banger with some personal bars the other two just kind of sound like kevin is riding really really really really really hard some andre 3000 influences it's not a bad collection of tracks but to me just kind of feels like a somewhat rough and a little unfinished set of songs to just keep the fans held over or maybe just remind people hey and I'm still kind of a solo artist and I'm still doing my thing and and maybe at some point you'll see more solo material from me which he has been teasing toward because with the release of this EP he hit fans with a few other dates a week apart so I'm imagining that he's gonna continue on this trajectory of dropping I guess more singles more EPS more solo material we're not exactly sure yet because he's being a bit cryptic about the whole thing but more material is is most likely on the way moving on from there another track from Haden Thorpe of wild beasts fame has come to the surface this new one over here is titled love crimes I do think the instrumental on this track is really pretty but the progression of this song is a little underwhelming kind of feels like we're just kind of stuck in the same spot forever on this particular track which is a little unfortunate because I did like his last single his last teaser cut quite a bit still looking forward to when he does drop this new album not sure if a review was in the works on it quite yet or anything like that but it is something I'm definitely looking out for as he in in indie pop and art pop he definitely has one of the more unique voices out there and if he does knock it out of the park it I definitely want to be paying attention to that so moving on from there Charlie Bliss has also dropped a track from their new album yet another one and this one over here actually is is maybe the most underwhelming of all of them so far I mean out of all the tracks the band has been sort of promoting they've really been kind of pushing a slightly new sound with a fuller richer more synthetic production palette this new track over here however is a bit more of just like a straightforward pop rock tune with kind of a 90s twist and you know 90s alternative rock and indie rock has always been kind of a huge touchstone for Charlie bliss and I feel like that's a almost kind of like preventing them from growing and advancing on this new track over here as this new song sounds pretty generic frankly if I didn't already say it which I did not the title of this track is hard to believe moving on from their chance the rapper and little yadi have dropped kind of a new freestyle track as chance the rapper is kind of letting fans know and making them aware of via social media and this song he is in debut album writing and recording mode and obviously dudes like little yachty are in the immediate area so he just kind of recorded this short freestyle with yadi which is okay beats okay flows okay lyrics okay really this this track seems like you know more of a reminder than anything that hey album's happening working on the album be watching for it be aware be looking out moving on from there also a new track from black belt Eagle Scout which is a saddle creek act that dropped into album not too long ago that I want you guys to be aware of if you're not already because there are some pretty interesting and low-key and and touching I guess how to describe it it's I guess singer-songwriter music but with sort of like an indie rock flavor to it but you know if you're really into some of the low-key sad singer-songwriter music and in lo-fi music and indie music that came out vehice records over the years that sort of stuff I I think you'll definitely vibe with what black belt Eagle Scout is doing even if I did find this new song over here myself to be a little underwhelming honestly loss and relax is the name of this new cut over here alright the best tracks of the week over here that I want to make you guys aware of first off I want to give a shout out to a Rammstein song that dropped a little while ago when I forgot to mention in the last weekly track roundup it's titled Deutschland and the band with this track it's pretty heavy pretty epic song attached to a very harrowing and dark and intense music video Rammstein being from Germany has never been shy about addressing you know their place of origin and sort of using that as a point of inspiration in in their work in some way shape or form and and this new track over here given our current political climate I think is pretty interesting given that they find themselves in a position where you know they want to feel happy and and prideful about their country of origin and where they come from but also they can't let go of and can't forget their countries particularly incredibly fantastically dark past and something in America I think you know sometimes we need to be a little bit more reflective about as well our country's dark past obviously in the case of Germany it's it's it gets pretty dark and the music video and the song definitely kind of addresses that in an interesting way and dig in the tune at the core of that a lot the track is really heavy it's really hard the song has the supremely dark feel to it that I think matches the tone and the energy and the message of the track really well and you know I I used to listen to Rammstein quite a bit back in the day when I was a little bit more into new metal an all-metal an industrial metal and there was a point in their career where I think they did fall off a little bit I still do kind of favor some of the older records quite a bit and you know I think this this new song over here definitely marks a bit of a comeback in my opinion you know this sounds like the band revitalized in a way so pretty happy pretty happy to uh to hear the band coming out with such a good tune and also you know not being shy about sort of addressing important issues and you know even socio political topics head on which is not really you know been something the band has ever been shy about you know addressing taboos and sacred cows and that sort of thing moving on from there I I just got a recommendation to try this band out in a recent live stream their name is Otto bouquet beaver a Japanese experimental and kind of noisy and alternative rock group that again up until recently I wasn't really aware of so I got this recommendation to try them heard some music that I liked then miraculously I guess they had a song come out not too long ago and the name of this new track over here that I want to recommend to you guys is dot sue cog a no onna not sure how to pronounce it I'm a dumb white guy and I only speak one language so that well English in the language of music you know the language of music and I do like this new track quite a bit it hits pretty hard and has that nice raw noisy punky feel that I love from some of the best Japanese rock groups out there you know over the years so the band definitely has something special going on I I would argue most certainly moving on from their nails the band nails one of the hardest heaviest one of my favourite bands out there nails has seen fit to drop a brand new single one track is I don't want to know you as antisocial as ever and the other track is endless resistance featuring Mac Mac's Calvera of Soulfly and Sepultura Fame and Max's voice on the track is actually really fantastic the first song is brutal as hell really killer combination of tracks nails as sounding heavier and as deadly as ever and cannot wait for the band drop some new material hoping for a new album sooner rather than later nails fuck yes movin out from there you knew it was coming you knew it was coming king gizzard and the lizard wizard has dropped another new song the band is relentless with all of these new tracks planet B is the name of this new cut over here and it's frankly it's it's amazing the band literally like writes an experimental thrash metal epic on this one yes the band literally goes thrash metal on this new one and it's it's really good it's killer it's heavy the riffs are great the performances fantastic production is good the vocal sound great they really embody the style and put their own little weird psyche experimental spin on it and the the tune and the writing itself is multi-phased and goes through a lot of changes it's like I said it's epic it's amazing just really excited for the risks and the changes the band is undergoing because as far as like rock music goes generally King gizzard is one of the most exciting groups out there and they continue to prove as to why that is with tracks like this moving on from there Jessica hoop has dropped another new track which is kind of meditative a little minimal very stripped back but I think her voice is really compelling and enchanting on this song I think even though it doesn't sound quite as quirky or the sound palate isn't maybe as stark as it was on her last album still there was a power in simplicity kind of element to a lot of her writing and her performing on that last record and I feel like that's still kind of the case on this new song over here which again enjoying very much the name of this new track is shoulder charge which you guys again should definitely try out try out all of these tracks link down below all of them in the best tracks this week you know section recommended moving on from there this group who I've been unfamiliar with up until this point french vanilla has dropped a track which is a really fantastic weirdo off-the-wall expression of some great kooky post-punk music with some wild ass vocals some weird dance grooves really loving the energy the band is bringing on this gonna be looking into this group a little bit further considering how impressive I felt this uh this single was it's also attached to a pretty strange music video Courtney Barnett has dropped another single as well look I'm gonna be honest I haven't been the biggest fan of Courtney's music up until this point and maybe there is something about her stuff that maybe I just favor it a lot more in small doses but you know what I did file I did find her you know kind of slacker voice and her very verbose lyrics and her garage guitar licks and grooves on this track to be pretty compelling not really anything hugely different from what she's been doing up until this point so if you have loved Courtney Barnett's work up until now you are probably gonna be wowed by this track as well you know it's very much in her wheelhouse and I mean I think done pretty well you know whether or not it means that much to me when I hear in the context of a whole album of songs that sound like they're in the same vein or maybe there's a few duds or whatever I don't know but as of right now I can tell you that this song I thought was pretty engaging moving on from there the band Black Mountain who I've been talking about some new material from for a little bit now they have teased toward their next record destroyer with another track this one being one of the weirdest songs I think the band has ever recorded boogie lover is the name of this track and it features a very fuzzy funky slinky and strange bassline it sounds like a bass line or a very distorted fuzzy guitar lick or whatever but it sounds like a bass line and it also features some very freaky odd vocals the band really throws it back to the days of old school psych on this one but they have a new kind of tongue cheak attitude about what they're doing that I think gives the track a kind of contemporary weirdness to it that I like quite a bit moving on from there the band Baroness has also dropped another song Baroness head's sludge metal heads epic triumphant metal ballad heads be on notice new Baroness frankly I did not really care for the last single the band dropped before this new untitled seasons as I thought it sounded like a kind of toned down leftover from their last record however I kind of felt like that was not necessarily the case with this new one over here feels like the band is continuing to push it further into a more melodic direction though which is not necessarily a bad thing you know because in the case of this track in doing that they were still able to maintain just the epic heaviness that Baroness is is known for and really enjoying again the direction that they're they're moving in as long as the song quality and the sound quality remains this high because another thing about the last track in my opinion it just kind of felt a little um you know Hollow the guitars didn't really have that much punch to them not really the case in this track though not the case with this particular track though so digging on the new Baroness over here and that is going to be it for the weekly track roundup everybody once more I do want to remind you we do have those amazing tour dates coming up we had the amazing tour dates coming up and I can't wait to see you guys on the west coast very soon so links to those tickets down below links to all the songs they talked about down below get turned on to some new stuff keep track of what's dropping and be on the lookout for my reviews of a lot of these artists you know coming down the road definitely the Baroness definitely nails whenever they drop something definitely freaking Rammstein when they drop something so you guys you guys you guys you guys you guys are the best Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever 
FjMD4H96TN4,oh hi everyone Disney tracked Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new show me the body album dog-whistle this is the latest full-length LP from new york rock band show me the body who made an explosive debut with the album Bobby Waller back in 2016 which was one of my favorites of that year mostly because of this album's raw recording and it's very unique blend of all things Punk and hip hop and noise the band eventually followed this project up with a very collab mixtape the next year corpus 1 which in my opinion had its moments but was just a little too messy and inconsistent to make a big deal over on Corpuz show me the body did bring some amazing versatility to the table though because this is probably the only band out there that can effectively pull off a droney post trip hop cut featuring Princess Nokia and also a glitchy industrial rat banger with Denzel curry as well as a lightning-fast hardcore punk barnburner threatening the right wing street gang known as the proud boys and I would like to continue thinking of show me the body as a group unique enough to pull off all those things a group that successfully sits at all these different genre crossroads in the underground but their latest effort here dog-whistle is more of a pure expression of punk rage a lot of the hip-hop and electronic sounds that informed their work up until this point have kind of faded away most likely not forever but that lack of an overt hip-hop influence is still the case on this new LP and that's kind of a head scratcher for me as that and all of the other genres that subtly impact it show me the body sound were one of the things that made the group's so unique so interesting and to jettison all of that at this point just seems like a strange choice but that's not to say the band and this record have no redeeming qualities without all of that it's that's that's untrue because dog-whistle is still a pretty crushing combination of New York punk and noise rock and blistering hardcore the grinding bass on this thing the booming drums the blaring ear piercing banjo licks the guttural screamed animalistic vocals the incredibly raw recording it has a nice clean punch to it but it still is filthy enough to make you feel like you have to take a shower after listening to it this thing also features a pretty tight tracklist at just around 28 minutes the speed and the ferocity of the performances on these tracks make all of that feel like it's going by even faster than it is even as the band is bold enough to pack some of these songs out past the 3-minute mark not usually something a lot of punk bands these days do especially punk bands that sound as raw and as noisy and as auditorally disgusting as show me the body does on dog-whistle the opener which is four minutes kicks off with these very spaced out milky bass lines their chorus sounds like the beginning of like an 80s post-punk album even as the building melodic forlorn banjo licks in the background just get louder and louder eventually though we are blasted with these screeching Punk riffs some pounding drums as well and even though the band is sounding really primal in this moment lyrically they're actually delivering a pretty smart critique of the band cycle of survival working performing working performing working performing this illustrates a picture of show me the body being plugged into what they're doing just as they would be like any other job the no work will set you free mantra on this track I think is really important to remember especially as someone who is a millennial who is subject to a lot of media and a lot of articles and think pieces that say oh the freelance economy is so amazing it allows you to just do whatever you want to do you're doing stuff on your own terms you you know you know do what you love for a job and you'll never work a day in your life when honestly even doing something as cool as being in a band can just be another rut to dig yourself into I also love the heavy and demented breakdown on this track the slight sloppiness of the delivery just makes it seem a little refreshing and kind of weird mutant the next highlight on the record for me is the anti-cop anthem badge grabber which kicks off with this near deadpan spoken word these industrial cycling skipping hits of what sounds like this this pounding bass or percussion dum-dum-dum dum-dum-dum gun eventually the ban turns on this flood of drums and vocals and screaming banjos the only thing more confrontational than the sound of this track are the lyrics part of monolith you will get nothing back not even your pride not even your life part of a monolith how it feel the die inside in the end in the streets you will die outside the brutal weirdo breakdowns I mentioned earlier they turn up on this track too this cut is absolutely hideous and in the best way possible the next cut that really wowed me in the tracklist here had to be forks and knives mostly for its explosive rap rock breakdown in the second third of the track the song suddenly brings these old school rap flows and jump the fuck up riffs it's like listening to the band lightning bolt if they were collaborating with Korn on that track that they had Ice Cube on the song now I know is not a favourite for me on here but it at least stands out for it being the band's first attempt at trying to do something more low-key it's a dejected and despondent cut that really tones down the aggression the vocals are delivered and like this near spoken word I wish the overall message of the track was brought home a bit better or made a bit clearer but still the song is unsettling to say the least the song Arcanum has a similarly slow bill but with a better payoff between this and now I know I wish the band just kind of kept this cut especially since the distorted banjo licks that kick this song off definitely make it a anaesthetics stand out in the tracklist meanwhile the closing track us a lullaby I'm not super crazy about the tune at the core of this one but the build of it is pretty interesting as it seems like the core progressions are mostly handled by these pitched samples of like droning walls of noise how the band is conjuring this noise and making it do what they're doing I don't really know it sounds like what you would get if the band no age we're forced to write a record for crust punks there are a few other cuts in the tracklist here like drought as well as Madonna rocket that hits some pretty good grooves and straightforward riffs they just feel like very meat and potatoes Punk with maybe a noisier or a more bomb a stick edge and overall I mean I think this record is pretty good I like it I'm not head over heels for it there are some spots that I wish were more original there are some riffs and songs that I think are kind of generic but generally I do like the recording I do like the lyrics I like how hard this thing hits I am sad to see the diversity of influences and sounds on a show me the body album dwindle a little bit even if they did manage to come through the more focused effort on this one pretty enjoyable record especially if you're looking for a Punk release that has a lot of lyrics that really burn the status quo to the ground come off a little nihilistic at points - I'm feeling a strong six - a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video for you to check out hit that up or the link to

ANqN835Gmro,it's rising it's rising hi everyone rise and rise Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new wise blood album Titanic rising this is the latest full-length album from singer and songwriter Natalie marrying aka wise blood Titanic rising may be the first album from Natalie marrying on the Sub Pop label but she has dropped many many many records to get to this point she actually has played bass in the long-running experimental rock band Jackie O motherfucker as well and for years now I've been hearing wise blood songs here and there that I've thought were decent but there's never been quite enough of a WOW factor to pull me into an entire album loving it from front to back I did enjoy hearing her team up quite a bit in 2017 with Ariel pink for a pretty sweet EP and Natalie's last record under the wise blood name even though I wasn't crazy for it it was the closest I had come up until that point to being enchanted by her her music her particular brand of psychedelic ambient space folk and pop going even further back into Natalie's discography reveals a pretty impressive artistic evolution up until this point given that a lot of her early works were pretty noisy experimental droney and now with titanic rising we have this pure expression of lavish exuberant pop it's just straight pop sure it's kind of vintage in a little nostalgic and it's style and aesthetic the instrumentals and the songwriting on this record are heavily heavily heavily reminiscent of the folk pop and chamber pop of the late 60s and early 70s with a few progressive passages thrown in a la early Kate Bush there are also some indie contemporaries out there with equally lavish and dreamy sounds that I think this record shares a lot of overlap with a little bit of beach house especially some julia halter very much julia halter some of the court progressions on this album might resonate heavily with fans of the elephant vi collective to get a major Achilles heel with this record out of the when it comes to having a voice with character I think natalie does have some ground to make up for on this LP I wouldn't say she has the most recognizable voice in the room but she does sing incredibly well she has good range she also has the talent to be pulling off these lead vocals and vocal harmonies in the background which I guess if she had a quirky or more idiosyncratic vocal style might come off a bit more awkward still though the instrumentals on this thing are layered so well they're eq'd nicely they're mixed cleanly it's a very panoramic feel you really get a good taste and a view of all the instrumentation the perfect amount of pillowy softness to the instrumentation as well a little bit of reverb a little bit of splash just to add some space the instrumentals on this thing also features some pretty nice dynamic swells on these tracks too it's not just a formless droney blob of reverb a hollow mess of nothing where every single sound is sort of like bleeding into itself throughout the entire record and it just like has no body to it it's not a monolithic wall of men shout out to Jonathan Rado a fox egde enflame for taking part in the production on this thing as well as wise blood to just generally the production here it's between the heavenly pianos and the slinky guitars the gentle bass the very simple drums that do drop some very effective fills here and there the airy organs the wonderful strings the color palette on this album is great sounds very rich sounds very glamorous even if at points it is a little similar to those contemporaries I mentioned earlier but one of the things I think separates wise blood from them on this record are some of the overtly vintage nods she makes throughout the tracks on this album like on the song every day where you can hear these very prominent saloon-style piano chords and cheeky handclaps it's a little glammy too you can eventually hear these rising ah vocal harmonies that feel like they're lifted straight out of the Beach Boys playbook but even though there is a heaping helping of nostalgia packed throughout this record I think wise blood combines all of these older pop elements together in a way that feels very modern and one more thing that makes Titanic rising stick out is how straightforward and instantaneously orgasmic the songwriting is every hook on this thing pops even on the tracks that are just maybe like okay and what's funny is that Natalie achieves this without putting out an album that's really all that punchy or overly aggressive or anything like that I mean some of the best chorus transitions throughout this record feel like I am just being overwhelmed with sound and emotion like what happens when you let the floodgates open on a really cathartic cry Natalie somehow captures that exact energy on the track something to believe just as we are hit very subtly with this light drum fill and then on comes this mountain of what sounds like harpsichord and weepy guitars and droney bass just lay down don't go by me the whole thing makes me want to throw on some lipstick my prettiest dress and just lay back and stare into space longingly what and look and when I say every song on this thing enchants to some degree every song on this thing enchants the opening track on this thing feels like I'm opening a giant set of great double doors to a beautiful wonderful hall of wonderful Wonder it starts off subtle and eventually changes into this glitzy and glamorous chamber pop featuring the kind of string accompaniment that made David Bowie's best tracks feel larger than life then there's the sad and elegant Andromeda which makes me feel like I'm living in the front cover of the album itself feeling kind of sad and isolated and weightless in a room totally submerged under water this is also one of many many many many many instances of Natalie on the record singing just some very difficult lyrics about love stop calling it's time to let me be if you think you can save me I dare you to try also on the song every day sailing off on the ships to nowhere got a lot of things to clear away got a lot of years of bad love to make okay these painfully sad lyrics contrasts really well with the tracks jaunty instrumental it is an excellently arranged piece of sunshine pop it's instantly addictive and features this grand outro that's on the level of a group like the WHO and to take it back to the lyrics a little bit love really is like the main focus of a lot of the material on this thing and it seems like natalie is kind of circling around a certain person or a certain relationship I don't know who or what relationship it is that natalie is so deeply infatuated with on this record that is just sort of itching at her but these feelings of sadness and loss and loneliness and longing and desire they permeate every corner of this album I also like the stiff lead vocals and swelling analog synth notes as well as the dizzying synth arpeggios that are locked in very robotic lis that play at the very start of the song movies sounds like the kickoff of a Laurie Anderson or a tangerine dream Odyssey or something the song eventually moves into this fantastic build up feels truly intergalactic the reverbs on the vocal harmonies here just wring out into oblivion the title is so utterly fitting because this song just feels cinematic the most cinematic on the entire record for the very end we reach this heavy droney climax with driving drums a lot of sound bleeding into itself but it's so explosive it's so hard hitting the the chaos of it really just kind of adds to the excitement factor it's in the last leg of the record where I think things trail off just a little bit or Natalie and Jonathan start slightly painting themselves into a corner the song wild thyme is a cute and funky Oasis on the album but it's it's not one of the most solid Tunes in my opinion doesn't pop quite as hard as much of everything else here meanwhile mirror for members has a solid tune at the core of it but be instrumental I think could use a bit more variation when the chorus eventually does come in instrumental it does feel like a bit of a dud a bit blobby and one-dimensional in my opinion the song picture me better thankfully is a better tune better instrumental sees the acoustic elements of this album embraced even further the chorus is one of the most angelic on the entire record and lyrically it feels like a kind of idyllic send-off for this album's themes of again romance and love and not so much romance and love sure the relationship on this thing seems like it never really fully completed or connected but this track does leave us with a positive sense of closure I guess but yeah this album is great this is fire the songs the production the arrangements which are near genius most of the time the mostly watertight tracklist I like the few transitional moments peppered throughout this album - I mean sure a few lulls on the back end but overall I think the album's biggest issue is that Natalie could be doing a lot more I think to put her own unique spin on this sound and on this style which I've heard done again and again and again before though again tons of respect for the fact that in this instance she has performed within this chamber pop and art pop style so well in fact after this record I would say that I'm very much looking forward to hearing Natalie continued to explore and experiment and find her own lane within this style or even move on to something else who knows very solid very beautiful feeling a strong 8 to a late 9 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would

WRH2Cn3ktY8,whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo hi everyone wear the pants stand out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new video sound machine album doko mean the endlessly groovy obivious sound machine they are back with their third full-length album second for merge records they are a group that hails from London and is fronted by singer you know Williams the band began to start turning heads in the middle of this decade as a new face on the amazing amazing amazing sound way Records label which usually specializes in uncovering lost musical gems on the international scene through compilations that cover everything from Panamanian funk to Thai jazz the Bibby O sound though borrows heavily from the world of old-school afro beat which of course made them a good fit for the label but they were very much updating this style of music by fusing it with the sounds of electro and New Wave which for me is a pretty exciting proposition but the group's debut album was a little gray kind of one dimensional the performances were there the energy was there the fusion of genres was there but not so much the songs and the production was just a little flat when the band eventually made it over to merge records and got a better recording for their follow-up record a few years later they delivered a handful of tracks that were way more lush and punchy and detailed aside from a few lulls and duds in the tracklist pretty much everything I wanted out of an Abba Bo Sound Machine album turned up on this record so a couple of years later here we are with the group's next offering doko mien and we're essentially seeing the band bring a few more sounds a few more genres into the full but with some mixed results I guess of course there are some true blue funky afro beat bangers on this thing the song tell me with its driving drumbeat and pulsating synth bass as well as its rhythmic embellishments feels like a great cross-section of Afrobeat music and New Wave certainly nothing new for a bit but a track that can go toe-to-toe with the group's best bangers up until this point you know herself is caught in the whirlwind of all this groovy instrumentation and vocally is essentially just riding the rhythmic wave dropping in these cool little quick vocal riffs that kind of play off of the instrumental when the horns come in on this thing it's over it's a jam want to come down also a highlight on here sees the group rocking a pretty classic synth funk groove you know on top bringing her usual blend of English and video lyrics the track essentially sounds like a giant cross-cultural dance party the intro track on this thing isn't bad either it might have a more measured groove than that of many other songs on this record but there's such a cool cross-section of sounds on this thing be rigidly sequence since the classic soul girl group background vocals the multi-dimensional drums the psychedelic guitar solo also Eno drops one of the best hooks on this thing I need you to be sweet like sugar which in a way kind of reminds me of the flow and the pacing of Grandmaster Flash's the message don't push me cause I'm close to the edge so there are a lot of hard hitting groovy and danceable highlights on this thing where doko mean actually ends up faltering is in pretty much exactly the same places that videos last full-length album faltered you have flimsy ballads and mellow cuts on this thing that aren't really all that well written and they're not complemented all that well in the linear fashion with which the band performs and writes their Tunes getting lost more in the drive and the direction in the groove of a track than the composition of it so yeah I think some of the mellow cuts on here could use a bit more restructuring better writing sharper choruses and in these contexts on the album where iNOS voice is left with a lot more space to work with rarely does her singing actually stun especially on the track guess we found a way where her singing just sounds like really bad karaoke even if I do like the instrumental kick off of the song which sounds like an interesting combination of neo-soul and some euphoric psychedelic rock from Australia and just like on the last record a video pops in a couple of tracks that feel less like finished songs and more like just I don't know random ideas that weren't developed all that far but they made it onto the album anyway I mean in a way it does feel like I'm listening to the same album over again but in sort of a diminished capacity granted there are a few added genre fusions that didn't make it onto the last album the eighth track on here is probably the furthest the band has ever drifted from any western music influences ever and I'm also loving how the band included all of these jazz pianos on Basquiat but still even with this I can't say a Bibby o has necessarily improved upon their sound or their style or their ability to craft an album in any significant way from a few years ago to now it's still not a bad record the jams are incredible they alone make this album very much worth your time even if some of the deep cuts on this thing are a little awkward or underwhelming I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next it's like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a video that you can check out hit

Uq-JKl8-4Ek,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another y-you know review where I go over a bunch of Records that I wasn't able to do a formal review of from the past month or so talked about um short form gauntlet style one after the next you know what it is that's what we do here in the Y you know review let's get into it ba-bam new a beat air record here a lot of fans freaking out over it saying that it's one of their favorite records from him period but personally I still don't really see it I've never been big on a lot of the anko solo material and that just is the case on this as well I mean while it's not as abrasive or as annoying as some of his past works in my opinion the production on this thing is just way too washed out the vocals way too obscured I don't find how av treats sound on this record to be all that interesting it just sounds very bland very messy very choppy and Hollow I'm not getting a lot out of it unlike you know the new panda bear record which a lot of the fans are saying is like his worst so I don't know I just feel like when it comes to an Co solo material I am just on a completely different planet than the fans are I don't know ladies and gentlemen welcome to the most generic run-of-the-mill nonspecific indie-pop I've ever heard in my entire life yay yes this kid can rap fast raps pretty well comes together with a few catchy hooks and he is pretty decent at emulating a lot of sounds that are really trendy right now in contemporary hip hop can't really say there's anything on this that made me drawn to him as an artist though you know a few bops here and there but for the most part I really came out of this having not any sense of who this kid is it mostly just feels like a compilation of hey I'm copying this I'm copying this I'm copying this I'm copying this here's some not-so-good features here's some bland production produced by Dan Auerbach of Black Keys Fame you know going into this Yola record you're already gonna be hit with kind of a vintage sound and that's exactly what she brings if you are into guitar backed soul music with a bit of a country twist this is very much worth your time I think she has a decent voice as well though occasionally I think the nostalgia factor kind of takes precedent over the vocal personality occasionally over the songwriting but if you want to hear something sweet some old-school something well produced and maybe somehow use that to work a bit more country into your life than give it a listen [Music] new periphery record I have not really been a big fan of the band's material up until this point and honestly this new record over here is not turning me into a believer the soaring Linkin Park esque lead vocals on here the guttural growls the generic gentie guitar riffs the overly heavy production I do like some of the spazzy mathematical moments on here that kind of remind me of like Dillinger Escape Plan and that sort of thing but generally I just find this to be very cornball this is just not my type of metal at all with this album it's actually the first time I'm hearing of this group which is kind of interesting given that this record for them signifies a pretty interesting style change because before this I mean a lot of what this band was doing was some stoner rocks and heavy stone a rock with some kind of crazy and zany vocals and songs and that sort of thing so they were kind of eccentric already for the genre that they were in so it's not that surprising that they would kind of branch off into a weird futuristic electro rock blend on this new record or their latest material anyway and yeah I mean there are a lot of songs on here that I like there are some lyrics that I think are really hilarious and serve as some very cutting social commentary however I just feel like a lot of the ideas that the group pulls on this record feels like they're just being ripped straight out of the battles or the everything-everything playbook which I don't mind I love those two bands and I feel like it results in some interesting ideas off of this record but I think they're gonna need to come into their own on these sounds a little bit more before I'm like really freaking out over it Wow Karen over the yeah yeah yeahs singing over a bunch of generic and bland orchestral pop instrumentals I don't want to hear that j-roc and J punk band chai they are back with a brand new record and I was pretty psyched going into this because I liked a few of the singles leading up to this album but I mean as far as other groups I've heard in this genre ago that this album unfortunately doesn't really stand out to me all that much sometimes the production can be a little messy and not really in a way that I think complements the record makes the music and the performances on this thing exciting and yeah I mean aside from a few standout tracks here and there this record is very much in one ear and out the other for me but hey if you're looking for more in this genre and I know there are a lot of diehards for this sound and for this style don't miss out on this because it is very cute it is very peppy it is kind of noisy and chaotic at points they definitely have an edge to their sound even if it's not really crazy about it myself pop rock and alternative rock with a 90s twist and while I guess it's kind of interesting to hear songs coming back with this style and with this sound and there are some decent tunes and the tracklist on this thing for the most part when I when I listen to this and I finish it I kind of just come away thinking yeah I mean that was nostalgic but I'm simultaneously reminded of why this style of rock died out in the first place so that [Music] honestly was not looking forward to this new one that much and yeah pretty much it's like his least interesting album so far I feel like too many eggs were placed in the baskets of the tracks that have very big and relevant features on them because a lot of the deeper cuts on this thing are utterly boring don't really have much flavor to them not nearly as hard-hitting or as full of thrust as some of the best instrumental cuts off of the last album and what's unfortunate about putting so much emphasis on these tracks with guest vocalists on them is that they're not even really that good The Weeknd feature just sounds like an incredibly boring generic weaken song the higham feature on this thing is so lifeless it's pain inducing the Pharrell track is salvageable it's a sweet oasis in the middle of this very drab record yeah there just simply aren't enough highlights on this thing to be excited about it yes I actually listen to this all the way through and it wasn't that bad given I used to love me some ICP back in the day so maybe there's a bit of a bias there but I don't know there was a lot about this record that to me felt like they were kind of throwing it back you know to the old days just a little bit there are a lot of bangers on the front end of this thing some of the topical tracks around the middle like the gaming song are actually pretty funny if you take ICP sense of humor with a grain of salt and understand you know it's gonna be campy it's gonna be silly it's gonna be over-the-top there are however some slower tracks some conceptual tracks on the last leg of this thing that are total mess and prevent this album from really truly sticking the landing but all in all not not really a bad ICP album not a bad ICP album it's really not that bad so this new little sky's album in the grander scheme of the pop trap landscape auto crooner landscape and I don't know why it just sounds like a lot of very boring Hollow hipster soul in my opinion sure the production is a little artsy and weird and feels a little homegrown the guitars are kind of rough which I think maybe to some listeners it gives the record a bit of a raw endearing quality but for the most part I just think the vocals on here are very bland the songwriting is just super average and the record is way longer than it needs to be I'm just not feeling this one you know after the Kacey Musgraves album I I think I have all the hipster country that I need in my life especially given that this album production-wise is even blander than Jenny Lewis's last one was so outside of a few tracks this is a pretty basic and eventless collaboration between Chief Keef and Zaytoven at this point I think I enjoy both artists and relatively small doses and even though this thing is just 30 minutes and change it's for me it's still just far too much especially since there are so many more misses than hits on this thing and it seems like both artists are just taking shots in the dark and seeing what sticks with lots of average flows and average beats and auto-tune I don't know guys I get a lot of questions about snarky puppy every year do I like them am I going to review them soon I thought this new record might provide an opportunity to do both things but after another long visitation with their music with this latest collection of songs I'm convinced that they really are the elevator music equivalent of jazz fusion and yeah even though the band is fusing some interesting genres into the mix with jazz I just think their performances and also their overall style it's kind of average mild and maybe even conservative whereas jazz fusion really should be about fusing the genre with whatever is coming on the horizon in music whatever's new and exciting and fresh pushing the genre forward I just wish the performances on this thing had a bit more bite or the band's sense of adventure was stronger but especially with this album I just don't think that's the case yeah I can't say I'm that excited to hear Stephen Malkmus fumble his way through a bunch of bad cent songs because that's pretty much what he's doing here for a great deal of the LP for whatever reason he can't commit to this sound and detours randomly into a bunch of indie rock tracks that aren't even really any of his best I feel like I could have a bit more respect for this LP if Malcolm s could actually stick to the bad idea much of this record seems to be focused around but it can't even accomplish that mission have you given any of these albums a listen did you enjoy them a lot more than I did maybe you didn't if you did that's good that's good keep enjoying them that's fine I'm not going to enjoy everything you know what I mean I'm not not everything is for me and that's totally fine that's totally okay and that's that's okay for me and that's okay for you over here next to my head is a another why you know review that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel we will see you guys in the next one anthony Fantana why you know review forever 
GKaKkhdtmd4,hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and yeah it's time for a another edition of our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and worst tracks of the week firstly do want to give a shout-out to our sponsor in this video but people over at the ridge they make these nifty metal plated wallets minimalist in design sleek metal plated you guys know me I'm a minimalist wallet salesman I've been slaving away in the middle us while it mines for months now and and I've become the number one the top minimalist Wallis salesman hit up that link down below use promo code melon to get 10% off your first order and yeah just get rid of that disgusting bulky leather wallet in your back pocket slip this sexy thing in your front pocket and you're good you're good alright moving on from there do you want to give a shout out quickly to our Amazon and turntable lab associate links especially that turntable abalone we get kickback from that one if you're buying a colorful pressing of a record we've reviewed on the main channel or a turntable or whatever you find over there on our turntable a page that is to your liking and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the worst ones of the week it's been a good week guys it's been a good week a lot of good music this week only a couple tracks that I thought were really like truly lackluster or not worthwhile that we're kind of making the rounds one I saw a lot of publications making a big deal this Grimes track the Strand 'im secret Grimes track that has been uploaded to SoundCloud I'm not sure why it made it on the soundcloud to me it just sounds like a sketchy unfinished demo of a rough idea to me the the mediocrity of this are I feel like I can't really put it necessarily directly on Grimes because I mean was this thing even finished you know where are we even meant to be making as big of a deal over this as many people are I mean it just sounds not done to me it just sounds not done so yeah not really caring for it because it don't sound done moving on from there also not really caring for this song from the geminus brothers which does have done but also done not that good it's titled cool it's a very corny sleek unbearable piece of boyish pop with little to no flavor to it it's the Jonas Brothers it's it's bland as hell alright moving on from there to the tracks that I thought were kind of met actor Marco has seen fit to release another track from his forthcoming LP all our yesterday's don't enjoy it as much as the last song which even though was quite a bit softer than this new one over here did seem like I had a better tune at the core of it this one has a bit more pep in its step but the song at the core of this one to me just felt a little uh run-of-the-mill for Mac DeMarco in my opinion moving on from there the new little nas ex be leery Cyrus remix for Old Town Road which is pretty fun you know it has this fun moments I think the inclusion of Billy which is cool that he did it is still a little awkward but cool to see more people paying attention to the track and cool to see I guess the more people putting respect on the song and having fun with the song seeing the song turning more heads because it is a fun track that I do think is is getting a lot of a well deserved viral attention moving on from there Frankie cosmos is releasing more tracks in sort of her haunted items series where she's kind of playing these very lonely strip back piano ballads this latest set features the song rings on a tree that we are gonna link you to down below moving on from there monopoly the latest single from Victoria Monet and ariana grande a surprise non album collaborative cut that to me I mean it's it's exciting to hear these two together the music video is kind of lighting up the internet there's been a lot of buzz about this track but in my opinion the beat on here the flows on here the way Victoria and Ariana trade on this track it just kind of reminds me of like a race rumoured song you know just just reminds me of a race rumored song it's not that good race rumored song you know it's it kind of bangs it's got a good groove to it but not much else you know a lot of the hooks and a lot of the flows just seem very generic kind of in one ear and out the other frankly but moving on from there Alex Leahy Australian singer-songwriter is back with a new single seems like she's got a new album on the way that is getting a bit more attention and play than her stuff has has been getting so far over here in the US the name of this new one is am i doing it right and it's a pretty straightforward piece of pop rock you know no frills is very meat-and-potatoes piece of pop rock you know don't really love it don't really hate it I think she's a pretty capable songwriter are her songs surrounded in interesting or you know unique instrumentation not really but you know if you like your pop rock without a whole lot of muss or fuss to it then I think you'll probably get into this quite a bit alright moving on from there let's go to the tracks they thought were best this week the ones that wowed me the ones that stunned me first off wise blood I'm not gonna get too deep into this we're gonna link you to another track from the latest wise blood album that is out this week I'm going to be reviewing it as soon as possible a lot of people hyping this record up I have loved every single song room this thing I have heard leading up to the release of this album it's finally out it's here just give it a listen be aware of it look forward to the review look forward to the review alright moving on from there vampire weekend has seen fit release two more tracks from their brand new album this life and unbearably white and they're actually leagues better than the last two teaser tracks that they dropped from father of the bride which is very very very very good liking the acoustic groovy qualities of this life very much reminded me of Paul Simon and the balidaan unbearably white ain't really that bad either even though I was assuming from the title that the track would probably be cringy or something like that and that Vampire Weekend would essentially be making a comment on themselves as a band but no it's actually a pretty decent track so I'm very happy with that outcome moving on from there we have Titus Andronicus with a brand new single as well in a music video that pulls straight out of the Bob Dylan the playbook I blame society is the name of the track and it is a total rager with wonderful and socially conscious lyrics that I'm not gonna spoil or anything like that I just dig the poetry of them I like how sort of nasty and defeatist they are and you know it's kind of a very bold and angry acknowledgement of how nasty the world is let's move on to another track from Tim Hecker ambient drone and sound artist mr. Tim Hecker is back with another track from his forthcoming album and it seems like he's continuing on this trajectory of writing longer compositions more patient compositions something that is just a bit more explorative I guess you never were is the title of this new one over here I'm loving the jeroni meditative qualities of it and liking to see Tim Hecker moving in this direction I guess you know a lot of interesting sound playing on this track and yeah I mean the dude just kind of stays ahead of the curve when it comes to of just quality ambient music current-day alright moving on from there we have another track from fricken the National over here light-years is the title of this one it's a very dreary and downtrodden ballad and I like it quite a bit I like it quite a bit I feel like the Nationals vocal game has kind of picked up on this latest set of singles for this forthcoming album and frankly given that the band's last record is the first of theirs and years that I have like really really enjoyed pretty deeply this new record over here is definitely got my interest piqued and as long as the band continues to tease toward it with songs like these just gonna be even more psyched when it's finally out so yeah a very dreary piano back ballad over here some great vocals and uh some thoughtful lyrics attached to it really liking it a lot really liking it a lot the continues to stay soulful passionate mature on this latest material I'm moving on from there to get up kids the their comeback is taken so long man it's taken so it's it's taken a long time to happen although it's they yeah it's it's not I guess so much of a comeback I guess they did have that album it hasn't even been like 10 years since their last full length record and I don't think but it's been a while you know it's it's been a while and yeah I guess we're just still waiting and this new one over here though this is new track that they're just released is actually a really great piece of pop rock I like it quite a bit and this one was a title the problem is me I had a great hook on it good guitar licks good energy like the performance on the song quite a bit I think it's like the first favorite track I came away really enjoying from this new full-length album not really anticipating a blow out here on this new record coming out soon but you know you never know get up kids they had their time in the Sun you know they had they had some good tracks back in the day and maybe maybe they'll bring it back you know maybe they'll maybe it'll have a return to form here you know don't don't want to discount the record before you even hear it the band pile has a brand new track out where they guess I guess they're getting kind of political on this one it's titled the soft hands of Stephen Miller who if you follow the news you should already be familiar with at this point due to his work in the Trump administration and yeah the soft hands of Stephen Miller is the name of the new track over here and the band on this track seems to be going back to just like the really ferocious post-hardcore that I feel like they exploded onto the scene with a little bit you know they've always been a pretty dynamic band but I feel like with some of their more laid some of their more recent releases they've been kind of toning it down on that end a little bit again that ferocity comes back on this brand-new track over here even though it does take a little bit to build but it definitely gets there and the payoff is pretty incredible all right moving on from there another collaborative cut for Marisa Nadler and Stephen Brodsky drone flower is the name of their four coming album and estranged is the track that we're talking about here and it is a Guns and Roses cover but if you remember the last song that I talked about from this duo's collaborative effort here that is coming out very soon via sacred bones this is not like some alternative underground hard-rocking record or anything like that like the the the material on here very much lives up to the title of drone flower they are spacey droney meditative songs and ballads and it's I don't know an interesting pairing of these two and I think they play off of each other really well so even on this Guns and Roses cover of all things moving out from their jpeg mafia I did a full length review for his new sort of post veteran his veteran left over track the who again did a full-length review of it on the Fantana channel and thought it was pretty good you know good alternative pop rap track with some somewhat weird and glitchy production and Peggy dropped some pretty funny asides here and there about his creative process and just making music in general next Holy Ghost they have a brand new track out it is a banger it's a bang escape from Los Angeles it is a analog-digital funky danceable very groovy thang and I'm liking it quite a bit wonder if holy ghost are really gonna kind of put the fire back on the the dance floor with this new record of theirs fingers fingers crossed for that fingers most definitely crossed for that alright moving on from there Chong the Nomad has come through with a brand new track single over here and she puts her vocals front and center on this one they are very light they are very Airy they're very shy you could tell in a way she's a little self-conscious about her vocals on this one but I like the again kind of the shy and a vulnerable kind of vibes that are coming off the vocals here that she weaves in between the sections of beats on this track and yeah like in a kind of the the mix of kind of forward-thinking sort of freaky an alternative beat music mixed with some of that songwriting you know more vocal driven music so you know I think a cool pairing of of ideas and aesthetics and styles on this new track over here cool continue seeing her grow and cool to continue seeing her grow and progress and just try different things alright moving on from there we have another track from big thief I am being continually mesmerised and kind of enchanted by the material coming off with the group's upcoming LP just loving the strange marriage of indie pop but also freaky and I guess very odd and I don't know there's there's just a unique element of just folk music and singer-songwriter music in here that I think is very specific to too big thief nothing that I could necessarily compare directly to any one artist I don't know it's just I can't quite put my finger on it there's just something very big fefe about this new track over here I really can't I'm just really at a loss for words you know could be having a bit of a brain fart tonight but still I just feel like I'm gonna put a position where I'm just not sure how exactly to explain how mystical and otherworldly this new big thief song this new big thief song sounds it's titled cat tails I haven't mentioned that yet but it is titled cat tails check it out below alright moving on from there Anderson pack comes through with a brand new single from his forthcoming album features Smokey Robinson and I feel like this new teaser cut over here actually sort of delivers on how Anderson was selling this album as who do you guys like soul music there's gonna be a soul record because he really kind of throws it back to that era especially you're talking about smokey on the track on this new song over here it has a few corny lyrics here and there but it's actually a very loving romantic sensual song with a smooth ass instrumental and like in the vibe quite a bit Anderson's vocals his talents very much lend themselves to the style of music so it goes over really well again if you were looking for super deep passionate moving lyricism maybe it's not gonna blow you away on that front but still really liking kind of a change of stylistic pace that Anderson's bring it on this one alright and I think the final track that we're gonna mention here is the legendary post punk and new wave group a certain ratio have actually dropped a Talking Heads cover of all things houses in motion and it's actually really great rendition of the song and you know just look for it down there below with everything else so you mentioned in this video and that has been our weekly track round up everybody I hope you're doing well I hope you've got turned on to some good stuff in this video check it check it check it check it check it check it check it check it you get you get you can check it check it check it you could check it all down below again along with our sponsor over at the ridge its flipped upside down and now it's right-side up and we'll see you in the next video everybody Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup 
_EbckCohk7s,h/h hi everyone hi to be placed Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Billy woods and Kenny Segal album hiding-places since I started following his work earlier this decade New York rapper Billy woods transformed his once sort of spotty discography into one of the most perplexing consistent and heavy hitting in underground hip-hop and maybe some of you guys don't feel that way but I do from his powerfully dark and sobering solo works like history will absolve me as well as known unknowns to his imperfect but admirable attempt at writing an album of just very short brief wrapped vignettes on today I wrote nothing and I should also mention the increasingly impressive output of the duo that he's in with a lucid Armand Hammer Billy's rap style is admirably unique bordering very much on spoken-word in his tone and delivery he writes a lot of very gritty and cryptic bars that are often enhanced with an incredibly dark sense of humor which a lot of times does seem sort of like a coping mechanism and I would also say Billy could be defined by his devastating cynicism as well as the kind of social commentary that reminds us that we live in a sick sad world if you're more in the market for like a feel-good mclemore jam Billy's probably not going to be your cup of tea and on this album Billy is teaming up with la beat wizard Kenny Segal this dude has solo efforts going back to the 2000s he made a few production appearances on the last Armand Hammer album there was already an established connection there so it's no surprise that Billy and Kenny would have possibly worked on a full LP which he has done before with the legendary blockhead on two albums and considering the caliber of producers that Billy could be or has worked with in the past I don't think he'd bring Kenny into the fold this deeply if he wasn't bringing some some production he some of that red-hot beat and so what's Billy's story this time around on this record in many respects it's sort of a same old same old thing though that's not entirely a bad thing because I am generally pretty impressed by the grim and very defeatist stories that he works into his tracks lyrically Billy continues to veal so much and yet he himself remains in the shadows hiding places is actually a very fitting title for this album because the song was off of this record feel like they were written by somebody who is like holed up in a dingy apartment of course like every project up until this point Billy brings some amazing and hard-hitting one-liners that are just beyond clever some that are incredibly self-deprecating and see Billy taking shots at his own obscurity too scared to write the book took it put it in the hook of a song no one listened to it looks like I wasn't wrong album dropped with a thud awkward silence like when the grenade had dud a bar that comes off of the track steak knives which is a song all about getting second place the title itself is a reference back to old game shows that gave away steak knives as consolation prizes Billy essentially dating himself pretty heavily on the subject matter and reference on this song however even though this track is kind of short and I do wish it went on a little bit further I do think Billy ends it in a genius fashion where he is in a car with a friend he's not doing too good they're kind of talking about sharing in the same misery and experiences Billy says the steak knives mantra out loud in the car and his friend says what you say and he says it's just a line it's just a line creatively portraying Billy as someone who's out there in the world having everyday interactions but also these songs and these Ryan jurists playing through his head he's existing in his brain with these songs these themes continue on to bars like dark comedy dog I beat him in the head when what I'm just trying to beat the spread quit my job to kick raps instead so family meeting everybody got to start bringing in bread at the end of this particular track Billy's delivery gets even more heated as if he's slowly going mad with this claustrophobic B of detuned guitars and horror movie synths and stretched out crash cymbals closing in on it there are just so many tracks on this record that bring this infectious sense of dread that only intensifies on on certain other cuts from this record like the tracks spider hole which also features quite a few isolationist themes like it's just me in the spider hole that's the best part Broad's smile cop and legal weed from fake hole-in-the-wall I don't want to go see Naz with an orchestra Carnegie Hall no man of the people I wouldn't be caught dead with most of y'all between the references that Billy drops the character building the evocative imagery I love hearing him rap but also he is so much of a poet I'm almost just as pleased to read what he's written I think Billy's poetic prowess is certainly on display on the opening lines of houthi stood pooled in porch light cut my shadow off with a dull knife whispered in its ear then sent it off into the night set the trap for the mice the rats whatever's in the pipes corner of your eye the edge of the white that's where I live I'm set for life to put it in a way that I think the kids will get a lot of what Billy woods raps on this record actually reminds me of the past couple of Earl Sweatshirt albums mostly when it comes down to the lyrical themes although there are quite a few instrumentals on this record that are very droney and lo-fi and kind of mellow but again there's very much an overlap in Billy's subject matter in earl subject matter between the depression the isolationism in how his mental state and all the awful things in the world around him kind of manifests themselves in these terrible things that just ruin his life make him just I guess in an in a sorrier state I think that's pretty much the point of the song off of this record a day in a week in a year which features some pretty heavy and dark stuff even references to addiction look I'm no stranger to and I'm very much a big fan of comedy dark comedy laughing in the face of all the terrible things that the world is throwing at you but the degree to which Billy embraces that on this record even makes my eyes go wide at some points like on the track big fake laughs where he says I got a letter from my insurer the other day opened it and read it and there's a bit of an aside where he says this is gonna be good news said that the treatment wasn't covered turned to the family like I guess I'll just forget it just forget it big fake laugh ah ha ha ha ha ha ha this ain't a Denzel movie don't try to think fast while I don't think this album necessarily features Billy's most well crafted set of songs in terms of structure and hooks and progressions and topical focus and all that jazz it is certainly his most personally cutting record so far the production on this record is generally pretty great even if some of the structures on these songs are a little flat and repetitive to the point where they stale out some of the crisp and quality loops that Kenny brings to the table still though I do love the deflated and sad melodies as well as thud II drums on the opening track spongebob they are a perfect tone setter for the record and also Billy's lyricism I love the thick mellow melodic and jeroni spider hole it is absolutely sad and gorgeous I love the dreamy flute melodies on the track houthi as well as the sweet little jazz chord changes that are peppered throughout a few points of the song also the girthy juggernaut beats and massive bass hits on the track big fake laughs add up into a great instrumental as well I will say as far as cons of this album in the grander scheme of Billy's discography narrative Lee this isn't a huge change of pace it's not a major revelation or anything the most refreshing thing about it conceptually is the inclusion of Kenny Siegel and while I do love his production on this album I wouldn't say putting Billy and him together is necessarily a game changer or anything like that I also wouldn't say there's anything particularly special about how the songs on this album are sequenced or flow mostly feels like a loose collection of songs that are somewhat tied together by all of the emotional and personal traumas that Billy details through the lyrics the features on this album are okay I wouldn't say they lead to a whole lot of stunning moments either the Lucid appearance on this thing is surprisingly short and in my opinion doesn't provide a whole lot to the record itself the mother Mary appearance on here is a bit of a head-scratcher in that the track add a I think very much needed a melodic vocal lead of some sort given how mellow the song is but her singing is so faint on this song it's just almost not there in a way self Jupiter a freestyle fellowship is actually hands-down the best feature on this entire thing not only from his very smart and entertaining bars in the first half of his but also sort of the mini acted out sketch that he plays out in his own mind over the instrumental when the instrumentation turns into a somewhat of a creepy soundtrack of sorts is actually pretty amazing I think he handles this track really well the transitions that he performs are pretty cool although I will say instrumentally this particular track does feel like the biggest hodgepodge on the entire album which consistently as I go back to it again and again and again I just feel really kind of lost in it and not really in a way that's all that fulfilling also to take it back to the track crawl space that illusive featured on there is a bit of a weird beat switch on that track that kind of let me down a little bit in that it's not that I dislike the first beat on the track or the one that we eventually moved into but the very bland fade that introduces the change really just to me felt very um I don't know underwhelming it's like the most uneventful beat change I can imagine there's no drama or hit or anything to that introduction of this different instrumental still having said all of this some of Billy's best material does turn up on this record best versus best performances Kenney generally on this thing pretty much kills it as someone who's been listening to Billy's work for a little while now I feel like this record for me is just continuing to follow him down the rabbit hole and mostly loving every minute of it even if after this album little worried about the guy feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit

GyvWvIlG3Vo,so long farewell auf wiedersehen goodbye hi everyone goodbye channa here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new la dispute record panorama this is the 4th full-length album from michigan-based emo and post-hardcore outfit la dispute a band that separated themselves in their respective genre pretty early on with their incredibly intense poetic lyrics that built into these emotionally devastating narratives also some pretty dynamic rock instrumentation behind all of this - this is especially true of highlights from across the band's discography like Hudsonville Michigan 1956 new storms for older lovers and king Park it feels like such a long time ago at this point but the group's last full-length LP rooms of the house was a pretty admirable attempt at I guess taking La Dispute sound up until that point and condensing it down a little bit trying to write and record songs that were a bit more to the point I mean there were a lot of good tracks and tragic stories on this album don't get me wrong but I think this album's full potential was kind of kneecapped by the awkward marriage of jordan Dreyer's a really intense storytelling in just this more straightforward rock instrumentation both of which just felt really at odds with one another for a band like La Dispute more dynamics is probably better than less in most cases even if it does make the group's records less hooky and immediate and panorama seems kind of like a return to that Fulton Street wanted to add up into a 10-minute emo epic with Dreyer dropping these heavy lyrical passages about death near the interstate fading memorials lost lives forgotten and it starts so quietly for a lot of spute song with these gentle Chie me guitar softly swelling and growing alongside some soft spoken word the track progresses to this great post rock ish buildup and eventually reaches an incredible climax with a lotta bite and a lot of drama Fulton Street 2 carries the momentum of the previous track into some heavier guitar passages Dreyer is these themes of loss and moving on and time passing with snow falling and covering everything i love the heavy rushes of guitar on this thing also the sound effects of what feels like just noisy you whooshing throughout the mix it's kind of like the band is recreating the sound of that thick and nasty snow kind of blowing in and taking over everything it's a pretty great and powerful start to panorama and even though when you look at the track listing and the album length of this project it's nowhere near as grand or even as traumatic a statement as la disputes first couple of records but panorama is unique in the law dispute discography and that a lot of the tracks on this thing do connect and transition into one another not just in a narrative sense which has been the case for a lot of la disputes music up until this point this results in panorama being one of the more holistic experiences in the La Dispute discography which gives me the sense on this album that I'm traveling through an experience or a progression of some sort the next track rhodonite in grief seems like a takeoff of the previous two cuts and that we have people depicted on the song in the deep throes of mourning it seems like they're grieving the loss of a loved one and wanting to die the track also features this very melodramatic but also hard-hitting refrain of lifetime's live to die the cut also features this dreary but killer chord progression a mellow but very sharp guitar line and some subtle but great horns that add a lot of flavor to the mix to a lot of sputum entually progresses this into a pretty fantastic instrumental bridge and leaves us with a pretty chilling finishing mantra rhodonite for stress promethazine for sleep a rabbit toy for kids my deep condolences closing words that put our characters in this limbo of dependency to deal with the emotional pain with one of the two people depicted here taking on a bit more of a caretaker role the band smartly brings the energy up on the next cut from this thing anxiety panorama which definitely lives up to the title with its crashing walls of guitars and drums and shouted lead vocals not one of the best emotional ragers La Dispute has ever penned but certainly one of the best on this record the band then transitions into some very low-key spoken word on the tract in northern Michigan which is not a surprise considering how much of the band's discography up until this point has dabbled in that a little bit or essentially could be boiled down into a not spoken word but shouted word weirdly enough La Dispute is kind of taking a risk at this point in their discography by playing is so soft and subtle on tracks like these there's actually something pretty compelling about some of the quieter moments on this record even if it does kind of come off like something you might hear on an old me without you record but with a bit more tension and drama especially on this track where you have these droning swelling layered ambient tones kind of taking up a lot of the space in the background after this point on panorama though I think La Dispute does start to paint themselves into a corner even with the band's obvious attempts at bringing more mellow variations into the fold instrumentally views from our bedroom window does leave a lot to be desired I feel like the band's written better Rock passages than this in the past it also doesn't help that this track features are pretty standard and run-of-the-mill vocal performance from La Dispute not to mention the lyrics are kind of underwhelming on this one they have a lot of flowery language and evocative imagery but they are very low on emotional and narrative impact the band loses me once again on the very riffey footsteps at the pond which instrumentally sounds like one of the harder more edgy tracks off the last Interpol record the mix is also a total mess this gigantic distorted swell of guitars in the first leg of the song sounds like a muddled mess even though this album continues I don't really feel like it adds all that much to La disputes artistic profile the only track that I think comes close to stunning in the second half here is the closing cut which does a great job of tying up a lot of the narrative themes up until this point from Fulton Street to the traffic to the bedroom window all of these memories from previous tracks replaying over some distant fuddy drums and splashy acoustic guitars the song does try to provide a nice moment of finality in the tracklist here but hearing a lot of these ideas come back full circle only makes me realize that this has not been the best set of La Dispute songs and stories the perspectives depicted on this album are nowhere near as memorable or as emotionally cutting as they were on wildlife and even if it did feature some weak instrumental moments rooms of the house was much more spellbinding lyrically it also does not help that the close tract on here instrumentally does not progress all that well I think it kind of ends up spinning its wheels in the mud in the second half the vocals even as they get shouting and a bit more intense just end up getting lost in the washed out acoustic guitars it's kind of anticlimactic honestly still this is not necessarily a bad record from La Dispute I can understand hardcore fans being into it but for someone who's been listening to their music for a while now it feels like we're reaching a point where their idiosyncratic style is becoming an albatross around their necks they can't seem to drift away from it because when they do the results are usually awkward and yet the more they draw it out the less they seem to get out of it I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're

07CQapiPPT0,all right thank you hi everyone thank the new utano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new the comet is coming album trust in the life force of the deep mystery this is the second full-length album from uk-based jazz trio the comet is coming who I was turned on to last year by some viewers after my review of the best jazz album of 2018 suns of chemists your queen is a reptile an excellent album that features the jazz stylings of Shibata Hutchings who also masterminded a 2016 album that I should have reviewed I suck but anyway some viewers were telling me that because I loved Hutchings playing on that sons of Kemet record I'll most likely enjoy his input in this other dirt that he is a part of the comet is coming and also the group presents a pretty exciting fusion of jazz and electronics and it just so happens that they put out a record the year after I found out about their existence so why not talk about it and I'm pretty glad I strayed into this album because it's a really great combination of everything jazz does certainly sit at the root of nearly everything the trio does but they somehow effectively fuse it into a successful space rock excursion some sax led freak hip hop and almost dubstep inspired jams some neo psychedelic jazz rock and the third track of this thing which I could really only describe as propulsive croute rock Ian's New Wave psyche jazz stuff across this relatively trim record the band manages to cover a lot of different jazz fusions some of which feel entirely original or at least on the cutting edge of the cutting edge from another dimension at the very least I love the opening cut and closing cut on this record both of which bookend this album with some heavy droning mind-bending spiritual jazz but both have very different tones the opening cut on this thing is much more ominous and foreboding kind of dark a little mystical sounds like it's coming straight out of a psychedelic surreal desert spirit journey experience meanwhile the closing cut on this thing is much lighter on the ears kind of heavenly almost like a sweet bit of closure after we have been through a very strange exploration of the mind body and soul the atmospheres around both of these tracks feel space-age and otherworldly the track birth of creation is like a weird fusion of like this steady very meditative almost like wonky inspired beat music a little bit of these sweet wringing kind of glitchy synth keys that feel like they're pulled out of a James Blake song and floating all over all of this you have these very deep and low and kind of strange Reed notes I think the pacing and the progression of the track is a little stale but I do like the aesthetic of it quite a bit sonically it is a very odd marriage of these jazz Reed's and electronic bits the tracks some on the fire that I mentioned earlier the third cut off of this thing I love the propulsion and the thrust of this track an incredible pulse and incredible pace to it Hutchings throws all of these reverb and delays soaked Sachs's on top of it just squawking and screaming away it's like the theme song to an old kids sci-fi show but all of the characters while they explore like alien territory and stuff like that they also play jazz the track super zodiac is kind of interesting because it does feature Hutchings going back to that kind of aggressive squawky stuttering solo style that he performed so well on that last sons of Kemet it almost feels like I'm listening to the very same build or concept of a song from that album but just with like an electronic backdrop the song astral flying feels like what you would get if you took modern jazz composition and fused it with like some old-school progressive synth music something almost along the lines of a tangerine dream with all of these Spacey and very steady synth arpeggios just kind of repeating away providing a very steady backdrop then there's maybe what's my favorite track in the entire record and that is blood of the past which is insanely heavy crushing massive gigantic kind of distorted sludgy bassline that feels like it's lifted out of an electric wizard song the tone of the instrumentation is dark it is tope Ian the track eventually progresses into a great vocal feature from UK rapper Kate tempest who delivers a very sobering verse about what seems like the world that we could live in where people understand each other and there's a greater appreciation for nature and so on and so forth but yet also an acknowledgement of everything standing in the way of that essentially and then the finish of this thing the way all the instrumentation kind of crashes and just heavily drones on feels like something out of a swans track it's a really blistering song the longest on the album and really the most fulfilling so there are a lot of tracks that individually I think are amazing on this record though I wish there was a bit more thematic and aesthetic cohesion between a lot of these tracks across the tracklisting as a whole record it does kind of feel like a bit of a jumble of different ideas kind of being thrown out there for the most part they're all well done and all well executed really it's just the flow of the record feeling a little all over the place not to mention there are a few tracks that maybe get a little stale in their progression a few more that kind of underwhelm like the track unity which I do like the intimate and very low-key vibe of that song I feel like you know maybe there should be kind of a breather before the last track on this thing but compositionally it's not the most memorable on the album and also for a jazz record even if it is fused with like half a dozen or more different genres across its runtime I do wish there was a bit more improvisation on all fronts throughout the record a lot of it sort of seems to be left up to the sax and occasionally the percussion but for the most part more improvisation more experimentation maybe on the electronic front on this record I think could have made it a bit more exciting still I do appreciate how forward and punchy and catchy and thrilling a lot of the cuts on this record are and I certainly appreciate how much the comet is coming is just trying to bring this genre into the next decade by bringing it together with so many other sounds and styles and doing such a great and a tasteful job I'm feeling a decent - strong 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next

L9fWqfDby9U,okay kiss my love my love for Billy I've written a poem Billy Billy Eilish why are you so stylish I will buy this album thank you hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Billy Eilish album when we all fall asleep where do we go this is the hugely anticipated debut album of California pop singer and songwriter miss Billy Eilish at this point I don't feel like I can say anything about Billie herself that hasn't already been ingrained into you after months of media saturation and softball interviews and photo spreads of her bright baggy clothing as well as polarized opinions about her and her music from across the Internet up until this point I haven't really been all that wowed by Billy's music itself while she has had some platinum hits in my opinion much of what she has released up until this point sounds more like an artist and development than an artist fully realized especially on her twenty seventeen don't smile at me EP which I mostly found to be boring outside of a few key tracks and in the midst of Billy's rise to fame I've seen many people kind of label her or describe her as yet another melancholic pop artist in a never-ending stream of melancholic pop artists you're Lana's and your lords on top of it there's been this growing skepticism surrounding Billy with music fans questioning how is she making her tracks how did she blow up how did she get to where she is today Billy is far from a do-it-yourselfer and her brother who is an experienced songwriter and producer takes part in all of her songs to some degree so she's not exactly a homegrown success and even though I do see industry plant as a legitimate term that can highlight the music industry shady promotional practices the term can just as easily be used by cynical music fans out of jealousy or a need to hate something I know it makes all of us feel all warm and fuzzy inside when our favorite artist who's been toiling in the underground for years somehow makes it purely off their own artistic ingenuity but for the purpose of this review I don't really give a if Billy Eilish rose out of the mud or if aliens dropped her off here on the way to another planet somewhere what ultimately matters is if this album is good that's the ultimate question because even if the industry did put you where you are if your album is not good your career is gonna flounder you're gonna go away just as it has happened to industry plants in the past also this is a review this is not an episode of this is your life so going into this album I wasn't entirely sure what to expect I assumed it was gonna be relatively low-key kind of moody a little dark I enjoyed a few of the teaser tracks to this thing like wish you were gay quite a bit but what I truly wanted out of this album is what I felt I wasn't getting out of Billy's music up until this point and that is a sound from her that is recognizable and songs that are memorable and honestly with when we fall asleep I feel like I get that I am pretty pleased with this record through and through surely promotional build-up to the release of this was kind of annoying and focused a lot more on Billy as an image more than Billy as a musician but the batch of songs Billy and her brother offer on the Staib you are really good in a way it does feel odd saying that because I know I'm not necessarily in the demographic of people who this album is aimed at at least from a marketing perspective but for pop fans of all stripes what's not to like on this LP up until this point I've seen numerous debates online about Billy's legitimacy as an artist but when you look at the production credits on this thing it's pretty much just Billie and her brother this is far away from your usual pop credits tracklist affair where you see two to three songwriters or producers per song at least like the opening intro on this thing suggests it feels like all of these tracks were created and crafted in a very intimate setting where you have two people working who know each other really really well well enough to let your guard down well enough to goof off well enough to be vulnerable knowing both Billy and her brother were home-schooled it says a lot about how close that brother-sister bond between them probably is a lot of the lyrics on the Sal are kind of depressing very sad dark maybe even a little edgy and pretty salacious considering that they're coming from a 17 year old I mean on the opening track bad guy you have Billy openly oddly this tough rough and buff guy while also depicting herself as a bad guy who seduces dads it's it's it's a lot but between the sticky and playful sinful leads on this track and the kind of ridiculous character portrait Billy is pulling together in the lyrics there's actually something about this track and a few others on this album - that kind of remind me of the unicorn's album who will cut our hair when we're gone sort of like the track tough ghost and again I also get this unicorns or lo-fi 2000s indie influenced vibe off of tracks like all good girls go to hell or my strange addiction which features these multiple absurd vocal samples from the office television series the American version but still to go back to bad guy it's a legitimately cool song with a creeping bassline some subtle driving kicks some very eerie finger snaps the track makes me feel like I'm slowly being surrounded and closed in on especially considering how close and hushed and intimate Billy's vocals are on this track and many others here too because bad guy is actually a really good aesthetic tone setter for the album as the rest of this record sticks to a pretty clear production blueprint but still offers a pretty dynamic and varied tracklist that prevents the flow of this thing from going stale but still generally across this album there is a lot of bear percussion lots of space in these instrumentals too whether you're talking about atmosphere surrounding the instrumentation or literal gaps of silence in between the bits of instrumentation and for songs that are so quiet and so subtle there is a lot of thick and rumbling and intrusive bass throughout this record - to the point where when it comes in it's like violently shaking other bits of instrumentation around it especially Billy's voice the bass is thick it is ribbed for my ears pleasure it's almost like I'm listening to the musical equivalent to like a bass boost beam but the sound is still really good it doesn't sound like a joke then there are Billy's ultra-quiet vocals throughout this thing typically singing at this V from front to back on an entire record would just leave me uh Turley turned off but not only to some of the great vocal melodies on this thing shine through anyway but also the way Billie and her brother subtly manipulate her voice throughout these tracks it turns a lot of these very low-key songs into a pretty strange and surreal experience I mean there are haters out there who may shock this album up to nothing more than just like a Lord ripoff but honestly I have not heard production this creative on any of Lord songs up until this point her debut full-length album pure heroine instrumentally was actually kind of one-dimensional and bland many of the production risks that she took on her next full-length LP melodrama didn't really pan out in my opinion meanwhile this album actually features some pretty cool instrumental reference points of course there are nods to modern trap production that are worked into multiple tracks on this thing there are moments for James Blake's first few albums seem like a huge inspiration to not just the pianos the vocals also the balladry also there are quite a few spots on this thing that just kind of sound like Kanye's uses but like with the volume and abrasiveness cut in half for a record that on the surface seems so bare and so downplayed there's actually a pretty wide array of influences and emotions on this thing it's just that Billie and her brother do such a great job of condensing all of it into a very clearly defined vocal and production style whether Billie and her brother are doing bangers or ballads on this thing they're putting out good tracks we have Billie swaying and crooning over these stumbling drums and sing-along pianos on the track as an E which is actually pretty fantastic cut about not doing drugs and seeing your zombified emotionally out-of-touch and selfish friends as something to cut off not copy and that vocal line on this track from the secondhand smoke to the not needing to take a zani that whole melodic line is it's perfect and almost feels like a throwback to an old vocal jazz song which I also think turns up as an inspiration on the track wish you were gay a track that lyrically speaking is also kind of tragic but hilariously Frank it's a glorious piano tune with Annika stick intro a smash hook essentially about a romantic disconnect over a difference in sexual orientation which is already an intriguing topic on its face but Billy did not need to go this hard on the lyrics the lyrics on this track are a perfect balance between being heartbreaking but also a little tongue-in-cheek but the number play on these lyrics the way she's descending from five and down or 12 and down it just adds so much character to the track in it's a track that was already good also the crowd samples on this track the cheering kids the laughing adults a la father John misty one of the best and most expressive vocal performances on the entire record what is not to love about this track is it just that it's quiet come on there are tracks on this thing where Billy is approaching much heavier and darker topics like on the suicidal listen before I go where she depicts herself as leaving and saying goodbye and saying sorry apologizing she's going up to a rooftop and then going down I love the dreary and sparse piano chords on this thing the insane and creative James Blake esque vocal edits the ambient and droning tones that sort of swell in and out throughout the instrumentals the very disturbing sample of first responder vehicles at the very end of the song adding to the tragedy of what the track is about meanwhile the sparkly acoustic instrumental on the track I love you feels like a cross between like some 2007 era grizzly bear and like Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah as part of the vocal melody line on this track resembles very much that of the chorus on that Leonard Cohen song but it kind of reaches a different conclusion and the ambience surrounding this track is gorgeous its pristine it's a lot of space but it sounds so crisp and clean and clear even though this is a very subtle and quiet album I can tell that you know either Billy's brother is like a master producer or just no expense was spared in the creation of this album although this record is not just all chili atmospheres and bummers though there is the track you should see me in Akron your silence is my favorite sound which is easily one of the most devilish and exciting bangers of 2019 no question no question no question no question I have no questions between the twittering percussion wavy and aggressive bass and also like dentists drill synthesizers whirring away there is also Barry a friend where the Kanye influences I mentioned earlier kind of come through in full force as instrumentally this track seems to borrow a lot from his yeezus single black skinhead I mean look this thing is far from a perfect album there are some tracks that I don't care for as much as others songs that hit a bit of a lull for me in general I think the record could use a bit more oomph especially in the second half and even though Billy has done a great job of defining herself on this record she still does wear her very obvious and contemporary influences on her gigantic sleeves I think the song when the party's over is a pretty decent ballad but I find the atmosphere and production surrounding the track to be a little bit more bland and uneventful than that of many other tracks here the pristine atmosphere of the song kind of reminds me of a Sam Smith song and not in the best way then there's the track 8 which is a bit of a head-scratcher for me still after multiple listens to this record it features these sad lazy day tiny acoustic chords Billy's singing in a very strange baby voice in the intro the track has a lot of weird memorable bells and whistles and a very cutesy tune that plays throughout but for the most part it feels like a malformed song that doesn't entirely know what it wants to be but it sits still I guess a bit of an uplifting palate cleanser in between all these very heavy and dark ballads then there's the peculiar and kind of cinematic instrumental on the track isla Milo which I hope I'm pronouncing correctly it was titled after a 2010 puzzle game I've never played before but still even though I am in love with the instrumental aesthetic of this track it is one of the more brief cuts on the album that I think could have used a bit more building out but even if I do have slight reservations with a handful of songs on this record every track on this thing is at least listenable plus I would argue Billie and her brother do a good job of sticking the landing on this record too with a dreamy and nightmarish closer that not only features some beetles ask vocal harmonies but also the lyrical theme of this track seems to tie up a lot of this album's sentiments around leaving saying goodbye possibly dying not only is this Billy Eilish album in my opinion very very good but it could potentially be the best pop album of the year in my opinion between its balladry it's creepy effects and creative approach to production the incorporations of electronic music and hip hop and pop and more I get the popularity and the promotion behind Billy and this album has poisoned the well for a lot of people unfortunately but don't get sucked into the extremity this is a very sharp and catchy pop album and it's one that doesn't jump out at you necessarily it kind of pulls you in and artistically it's such a great statement for someone at the age of 17 I totally love it feeling a strong 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it

dcBiPi0DxgU,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for another edition of our weekly track roundup where I go over the tracks from this past week that I thought were good that I thought were maybe not so good let's get into it first I want to give a shout out quickly to the tour that I have coming up this may West Coast tour the first date is already sold out that Vancouver date sold the frig out moving on from there we have Seattle Portland San Fran's some of those bigger venues following that original date in Vancouver they are more than halfway sold out so I mean look we're more than a month out we may be turning away some people at the doors the day of if we are you know it's sort of hoping and praying that there's gonna be some tickets day of show by them ahead of time so you know that you are going to get in that day it's like a TED talk on acid high on memes high on music I'm gonna be there Cal is gonna be there it's gonna be a good time all right moving on from there I want to give a shout out of course to our Amazon and turntable lab associate links they are down there below make sure to hit up that TTL link treat yourself to a colorful vinyl pressing of a record we have reviewed on the channel we get kickback from it and let's get into the worst tracks of the week the worst tracks of the week alright first off sky ferreira is back everybody and the sky sky ferreira is back every everybody everybody and new album is on the way the track the teaser tract of this thing is is downhill lullaby and it is the most horrifically boring comatose piece of overproduced pop I've heard in a while I mean there is way too much instrumentation on this thing considering just how I don't know how much of a nothing the vocals are on this track the the appeal of Skye's music unfortunately just continues to elude me really moving out from there pair Farrell of Jane's Addiction Fame comes through with some new solo music and I feel like the Death Grips thing is kind of come full circle you have the band sampling Jane's Addiction on their debut record and here comes Perry new music and it sounds almost like a weird industrial rock at points kind of like funky hip-hop fusion thing and yeah Perry is he is essentially just the beast he worships moving out from their new track from modest mouse I don't know what Isaac Brock was thinking on this one poison the well is the title of this new track and it sounds like a totally messy mishmash of a lot of different things between like the V like pinched harmonics on the guitar the noisy kind of new wavy riffs as usual shouting LP vocals it just sort of sounds like a total train wreck of music styles that should have never crossed over also do want to mention on this previous track over here from Perry the name of the song is pirate punk politician which honestly when you think about it is kind of kind of a Death Grips lyric moving out from there we have a brand new collaborative cut from a UK rapper that I just found out about and I enjoy what I've heard of him thus far quite a bit his name is Kidd bookie and after I hyped up a track of his that I thought was really good he contacted me and thanked me and said he had new music on the way with Believe It or Not Corey Taylor of Slipknot Fame and I don't know the potential marriage here seemed like it could be cool seemed like it could be interesting I mean for Corey to reach out to an artist like bookie and and want to work with him and see the potential in him I think is a pretty promising however I did not end up being all that into this track not that I think that bookies lyrics or anything are bad that's certainly not the case in my opinion some of the vocal manipulations and robotic choruses and effects do feel a little burdensome just like a little bit much kind of obnoxious but really what ended up turning me on the track was a Corey Taylor essentially trying to write a very edgy rap verse in the second leg of the song and it's a really a total mess but whatever moving on from there to the tracks that I thought were kind of meh that's really terrible but not necessarily songs that were blowing me away or anything like that certainly worth your attention let me point them in your direction first off toss man on earth has a brand new song out that sounds like a tallest man on earth song I'm a stranger now is actually kind of a heartbreaking tune of losing love I guess and sort of finding yourself in in that position where the relationship where the romance has been broken off and and now your post that and now you are sort of a stranger to that person to that situation to that relationship it's a kind of saddening you know but still I I feel like the the sound is sort of I guess or have been painted into a corner at this point which is unfortunate but still it's it's not a bad ballad moving on from there we have a brand new track from Kevin Moore be nothing sacred all things wild which has some very very very strong Lou Reed vibes coming out of the the vocals which I liked quite a bit you know it was actually kind of a cool laid-back somewhat artsy rock song that was a little low down and had a pretty decent chorus to it moving on from there this group who goes by the name of Gray's that I was not really familiar with previously has a brand new cut out titled Arclight and it is a pretty fantastic industrial piece of noise rock I mean the vocals and the songwriting aren't the best I've ever heard but goddamn is the mix on this thing heavy and noisy moving on from there the band ghoul has come through with a brand new track out of the blue Nazi Smasher is the name of it I mean instrumentally for ghoul it sort of sounds like your typical you know crossover hardcore punk thrash blend but it's it's about smashing Nazis so you know there you go Frankie cosmos is back with a more haunted items which sort of seems like it's just an ongoing song series where she's just kind of laying it bare on the piano very naked vocal recording and you know not super dolled up or anything like that just very intimate very sad very chill very laid-back the title of this new track over here that I dug from this new haunted item single set is the track eternal moving out from their Diane coffee has dropped another track from the forthcoming album internet Arms the title of this song is like a child does and in my opinion it's not nearly as showy or as fantastical as the last single it's kind of like a somewhat so-so run-of-the-mill piece of synth pop with some kind of campy very theatrical vocals but you know that's that's about it moving on from there Ciara has a brand new track out which I think has a killer groove to it loving that little guitar and bass line worked into the track loving the beat on this track her vocals aren't bad either I just think the court progression is a little generic again if I haven't said new album on the way but I don't know can't say I'm super excited based off of this single but I know there are some people looking out for this sort of thing so moving on from their cage the elephant has dropped a brand new track with none other than beck night running is the title of it and believe it or not this is kind of like a weird I don't know garage psyche Rock blend with some reggae and it's it's not bad instrumental ii actually think all of the sounds and aesthetics that usually get worked into a cage the elephant song marry pretty well with the reggae guitars and the beat and the kind of splashy trippy delay heavy and dubby production it's really just the vocals and the tune of the track that i just found to be so so honestly moving on from there Brooke candy has come through with a brand new track which is titled happy and it's got a lot of auto-tune it's got a lot of distortion a banger beat it's a little grating and difficult to listen to but I do kind of enjoy the oddity of seong quite a bit I do wish maybe the tune of the hook we're a bit catchy or a bit more solid but still I do enjoy the fact that the track is out there and at least she's taking a risk I guess moving on from there Bibby Oh has a brand new cut out I have been anticipating his new record quite a bit based off of what I've heard so far but I can't say that this new song old graffiti is allowing me all that much I mean I am liking the combination of you know psychedelics and electronics and Foulke music but really the tune of this one felt kind of bland and just really washed out by the huge emphasis on reverb with this one moving on from there we also have a brand new cut from alunageorge cold-blooded creatures featuring Bryson tiller yeah I mean for the most part I think the tune and the vocals on this one are actually pretty great Luna comes through with a great vocal line and Bryson does a pretty decent job as well there is definitely chemistry between the two on this track it's really just the trap dance beat blend of the song it just feels utterly generic and just I don't know just something nondescript just really not special in the current landscape of pop and hip hop frankly and let's move into the tracks that I thought were the best ones the tracks that really kind of stuck with me and and wowed me this week one little Aussie vert free Suzy is the name of this new track over here if I remember correctly it has been randomly dropped onto the Internet there has been a lot of rumors bubbling through the music industry saying Ozzy can drop a new album if he wants to and Uzi still wants to drop music and he hasn't really quit and it's really just like kind of believable and all this you know music industry drama and crap it's kind of keeping him from putting out into music and ruining the artistic process and so on and so forth and you know honestly I hate to see someone of Ozu stature and popularity sort of like fed through the grinder like that it's actually pretty awful because even though I'm not crazy about a lot of his stuff I know his fans love his shit and you know it sort of sucks that they can't get what they want because of essentially you know the bent over backwards position that Uzi has been put in but it would seem that maybe there's some new music commercial music coming out on the way and maybe he's kind of teasing toward that with this track we're honestly like the beat on this thing is raw as hell Newsies flow is better than it's been on a lot of his more recent material that has been out there as of late and I don't know I would love to just hear more rapping from him in the future where he is just like going this aggressive because this was actually kind of a you know bit of a barn burner in in my opinion moving on from there Seb addo has a brand new record on the way if here and feeling if you're unfamiliar with the group they are a pretty legendary lo-fi in the outfit and I don't know this track coat goes kind of hard I mean the riffs are gnarly the lead vocals are really gruff and nasty the drumming is pretty great as well yeah I mean Seba doe sounds as in their element as ever on this new cut over here and got to say I'm looking forward to hearing more from what the band is doing on this on this new one moving on from there a group who goes by the name of Seba Knapp sorry cap stead which is a South African group with members from all over the globe and they have put together this beautiful blend of hip-hop and neo soul and a bit of jazz and R&B and art pop on this track title Africa it is one of two tracks that is out right now from this new album there's that asset release in May and it is absolutely friggin gorgeous I cannot get over how beautiful this song is it is stunningly beautiful and I don't understand hearing more from this group that I just got turned on to this past week honestly moving on from there Rosalia has dropped a brand new collaborative cut with J Balvin and Cornell Torah is the title of it a lot of people have been kind of disappointed by this new song over here they've hated it mostly because it would seem oh you know Rosalia she's going in a reggaeton direction and and we don't like that we like her doing the flamenco we like her doing the weird Spanish art pop forward thinking bangers but listen this is the first time she sort of collaborated with artists who make music in this field it was only gonna be a matter of time before she dipped her toes into this sound even further because this is let's face it what is very popular and predominant in a lot of popular Latin music circles and and you know let's also be honest and say she has the voice for it you know she's a really great singer and it's not like as she sings over these types of songs she sacrifices her own vocal quality or that she sells herself short vocally and I'll admit that you know sort of hearing her go in this direction artistically on this track was a little shocking at first and maybe even disappointing but the more that I listen to it the catchy or the track got the more apparent it became that the production is kind of weird I would say the only thing I didn't really like about the release of the song is the corny ass music video but for the most part I even like Jade alvin's parts on the track I mean for the most part it's it's really just a fire cut it's just a really fire single and you know hopefully a more songs and this genre going forward you know stick to the roots of the sound but also kind of display the same subtly weird playful and in strange somewhat tongue-in-cheek qualities I guess because again all around this was a really fun and somewhat artful you know direction for this particular genre of music moving on from there a an old technical death metal group that has been around a while but has been on hiatus for quite a while a Nocturne Assaidi they are back with a brand new song brand new album coming out via profound lore precession of the equinoxes is the name of this new cut over here and even though I'm not a huge technical death metal head I do like kind of the the nastiness of this song over here I do like the strange synthesizers worked into the track it feels very futuristic feels very sci-fi feels very strange but it is totally just like you know nasty disgusting just as I love my death metal to be and but it's got some nice dynamics to it so I'm digging on this track quite a bit moving out from their king gizzard and the lizard wizard have come through with another cut boogey man Sam it is funky it is funky it is sticky as far as the melody goes and really looking forward to to this new record of theirs I mean that that fish's track that they dropped was still weirdest fuck and you know just like kind of left me scratching my head for the most part but I mean everything I've heard so far on this album is it sounded pretty dope alright moving on from there FOXO gene has come through with what I think is like one of the weirdest takes on Lou Reed's sound and singing style that I've ever heard it just sort of sounds like a very swagger Phill Lou Reed lead vocal but with like the freakiest most sour interjecting melodies throughout the song that just feel really off-putting but in a good way and I don't know man Fox Egan they've had some highs and they've had some lows across their career but as a songwriting duo I don't think there are many out there that go toe-to-toe with them and gotta say every album I am looking forward to what they're doing and intrigue you know of what the next intrigued with what's what's gonna be the next move so definitely looking forward to this so new oxygen album on the way hell yes and that has been I think the the weekly track roundup we have one more from a group by the name of black MIDI crows perch is the name of this new track over here and if you're kind of really into that spazzy abrasive freakish underground indie rock that was a huge deal in the 2000s I think you will get a lot out of what black MIDI is doing on this track over here this is not the first black MIDI song that I have shouted out in the weekly track roundup it's been a while since I've talked about the group hopefully uh you know it's it's it doesn't take very long hear more music for them in the future because I'm liking you know they're they're very again freakish approach to you know just a underground alternative sounds and rock music so gonna leave it at that alright and yeah yeah once more I do want to say come out to these tour dates if you guys can if you're on the west coast and at the start of May and yeah hope you all are doing well if I haven't said it already and I will see you in the next video Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever 
90xeylVOooE,hi everyone anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and it is time for a follow-up to a video i came out with on this channel quite a while ago ten albums I changed my mind on changed my opinion on a lot of people do asked me over the years hey have you changed your opinion on this album and that album and the other album and bah bah bah and I have made it no secret that in my opinion opinions are not set in stone opinions are based on experience and perspective and as long as you continue to grow as a person and have different experiences and also expose yourself to new music and new ideas your opinions most likely on everything that you've ever heard are going to change in some kind of way shape or form sure sometimes that changes Rapids sometimes that change takes a while I have done my best to make note of those changes large and small when I do think they are significant and worth bringing up whether it be in my year-end lists or the first changing my mind video the point is change happens you can't stop the change train so here are 10 more albums I have effectively kind of changed my mind on the first record I want to mention in this list is the Foo Fighters album wasting light which in my original review of this album I did give it a pretty favorable score I did like the record but I think in retrospect I do enjoy the album a bit more now sure there are some cuts on this thing that in the grander scheme of rock music may come off a bit mild not too hard not too aggressive or anything like that though I do appreciate that Foo Fighters did pack some really fiery and blistering tracks into this thing like white limo amazing track definitely one of the most head busting Foo Fighters have ever done but honestly even on some of the more middle-of-the-road cuts on this thing Foo Fighters pulled together some really good balladry Dave Grohl songwriting is just on freaking point from front to back on this thing while many fans may not see it as classic as the band's older material I I think wasting light over the years since it's been released has held up and maybe this is another thing that's kind of impacted my view of this record but the band's most recent two albums aren't really that good or at least are much weaker than wasting light which the grander scheme of Foo Fighters discography now I kind of see as their best record since the color and the shape so really solid rock record maybe not one of the best of the decade or anything like that but at the time I think I under eight AddThis one a little bit next in my list here miraculously is chief Keef's finally rich which at the time when this thing initially came out I was pretty harsh on it my more recent listens of this album haven't exactly turned this record into a classic for me or anything like that but I guess what's kind of interesting about the material on this record is that while I may not be head over heels for a lot of it I may see some of the tracks on this thing as ridiculous or kind of novelty or even messy to the point where they feel incoherent or just generally unenjoyable however I do like the influence and the impact that this record had on a lot of my favorite artists were favorite projects that came out of the soundcloud scene not too long after so in a way while I may find tracks on this thing like laughs into the bank to be sort of ridiculous I'm not entirely opposed to the influence and the impact that finally rich went on to have for as flawed as this album is with it's kind of weak features and compilation like flow the best tracks on this thing do have a pretty awesome and raw presentation a fantastically powerful aggression to them that at the time was sort of unmatched and energy that literally turned the entire music industry's eyes on Chicago and put a lot of pretty big artists in a position where they were either desperate to collaborate with Chief Keef or copy him and I think there's something to be said for that this record has definitely grown on me a little bit even if I think I am looking back on it a bit with nostalgia glasses and I am appreciating it more for its influence than what it actually was next in my list over here is the JPEG mafia project black Ben Carson which at the time I wasn't all that crazy about even if I did appreciate the lane that Peggy was trying to carve for himself in the noisy industrial hip-hop lane I admit to kind of sleeping a little bit on the dude at the time as the year this record came out it was kind of difficult filtering through all of the new faces and voices in this growing leg of the hip hop genre in my defense though he has made quite a few improvements to his rapping his songwriting to his production in the transition from this project to his latest veteran which obviously is the record that kind of sparked my love for JPEG mafias work kind of the case for many other people as well but now with having a better in a clear picture of what JPEG mafia is doing and trying to execute I feel like it's easier to go back and look at black Ben Carson and kind of overlook the stuff that's not necessarily connecting and see the artistic merit in it and see what Peggy is going for in a way my opinion changing on this project isn't too much unlike exactly what happened in my last video on this topic with me enjoying Danny Brown's the hybrid after being turned on and wowed by what he did on 30 and I think every music fan has been at a point in their lives where they've had that exact experience you hear a certain album from a certain artist or group that's absolutely doing nothing for you but then you go further into that artists discography and then you find a project that you actually do love and then immediately after that everything else that artist has come out with either it kind of clicks with you or you at least see a bit more value in it most likely because you're coming into that record with a greater understanding of what that artist is doing and what about it you find appealing but yes in retrospect I do enjoy JPEG mafia's black Ben Carson a lot more this next project or mixtape sort of fits into that same Lane and it's actually Freddie Gibbs cold day in hell mixtape which dropped much earlier this decade around 2012 I remember enjoying at least a few tracks off of it like the cut Rob Mia a friend robbed me a friend we'll leave it at that but lately I've been going through Freddy's back catalog because I listened to that recent collaborative project he did with spit and I've sort of been preparing for the new record is coming out with mad lib and going back through his old stuff some of which I know I've heard before you know this cold day in hell mixtape just started like hitting good hitting different hitting different yeah the overall production in the mix of this thing may be a little muddy which I think might have turned me off the time at least subconsciously because it's it's not a very bright punchy project but the beats and Freddy's verses and delivery on this thing are so raw and nasty dude sounds hungry all over this record and while a lot of the street tales he tells may not be as detailed or even as emotionally dynamic as what he was doing on pinata still all that stuff is very much here and there's also a really solid list of quality features on this thing too it's even kind of funny to go back and see Young Jeezy appearing not only before he dropped the young but before he and Freddie had their falling out but you know if you want to hear really like badass gruff straight off the stove mixtape cold day in hell is something you want to hear it's absolutely unforgiving in its ruthless attitude even if it's not the most well mixed and mastered project Freddie has ever put out some of you may be surprised to see next on my list is Drake's take care which if you look at all of my review scores of Drake's works is technically my favorite album of his if you're not counting if you're reading this as that is considered more of a mixtape but honestly out of all my years of listening to and covering Drake's music and I've talked about a lot of his projects up until this point take care is the only one in retrospect that's actually grown on me quite a bit now again I liked this when it originally came out and some of my original opinions on particular tracks on this record still stand to this day Marvin's Room I just think that tracks straight sucks but there are some really good quality features on this thing from Rick Ross to Kendrick to Rihanna also the track headlines along with a few others on here are some of the best pop rap bangers of the decade and I think over the years I've warmed up a lot more to Drake singing voice than I originally was when I first reviewed this record I'm not saying the album's suddenly become one of my favorite records of 2011 or anything it's it's certainly not reaching the the top of my year-end list any time soon but over the years especially as Drake's latest material has gotten more and more mediocre it's become pretty undebatable that take care of Drake's best studio album and I think that's at least worth reflecting on that's at least worth something especially since a good deal of the tracks on this thing at least to my ears sound better in retrospect the next album or opinion I want to talk about in this list is one that's kind of dogged me since I originally put it out and that is the Kendrick Lamar damn review there are loads of comments and messages and social media interactions that I see week in and week out that basically remind me that I gave this album a 7 out of 10 as if like I'm supposed to feel bad about that when it's obviously not Kendricks best album and you may be surprised to hear that honestly I enjoyed am even less than the day when I originally reviewed it the tracks on this thing that I originally liked the most the standout ones that really hit hard or super catchy like humble or the track DNA I actually even find myself going back to these songs less and less and less meanwhile untitled unmastered and good kid maad city and tee pad when I want to listen to Kendricks stay in relatively heavy rotation for me damn has kind of fallen to the wayside and the reason I think that is well I see Kendricks best projects honestly as kind of like an onion something that I can kind of peel back another layer of when I listen in again and kind of learn something new from and with damn I feel like I've kind of reached the point where I've gotten everything out of it that I want to as much of the production in my opinion on this record feels way more stripped back and flavorless in comparison with what's on good kid maad city what's on to pimp a butterfly I'm not really as desperate to eat up the instrumentals on this thing as I am on those projects I still find tracks on this thing like yeah to be utterly boring the song love I still think is it's been obnoxious and Kendricks vocals on God are maybe some of the worst he's laid to tape so far meanwhile the bangers the standout tracks the ones that just kind of hit hard when I first heard them have sort of lost their flavor like chewing gum and yes of course there are tracks on this thing that are more mellow and tone and carried quite a bit of lyrical weight like lust and pride those tracks still do mean quite a bit to me but they're not enough to keep the entire album afloat meanwhile I find the u2 feature on the track xxx in retrospect to just be obnoxious as bono is just like the epitome of fake woke and overall the narrative of this record or the progression of all these songs just feels kind of spotty there were so many fans and critics hyping up this record around the time that I think assumed listening to this album or or giving it a little time would reveal this amazing artistic map explaining the pathway and the progression of all of these tracks but honestly as the years have drawn on damn to me just feels more and more like a loose collection of ideas a lot like section.80 but the execution of many of these ideas is just kind of messy or just leaves a lot to be desired so no still not that crazy about damn and to the degree that my opinion on this album has changed it's been a little bit toward the negative the next album I want to talk about in this list is McIntosh pluses floral shop which a lot of people kind of point at as being a major breakthrough moment for vaporwave a genre of music that to this day is still active still functional still evolving and progressing even if a majority of the music journalism market including myself isn't really paying super close attention to it as there are still plenty of band camp based labels that are keeping the lifeblood of this genre flowing and since floral shop came out it's been interesting to see this new wave of vapor wave artists kind of take on the genre and incorporate elements of ambient music and pop and even trap it's been actually exciting to see guys like George Clanton burst out of the scene embracing the production aesthetics and the nostalgia of vaporwave but then applying that to synth pop and applying that to shoegaze and applying that to alternative dance styles of the 90s a lot of this would not be possible without this very basic rudimentary and kind of gimmicky entry point even though floral shop isn't the inception point technically for vaporwave itself also it did take audiences quite a long time to realize this album even existed but still you can't deny a great majority of the genre would not be here today without this album and even though Macintosh Plus Azure vectra's artistic concept or execution style on this record was pretty basic maybe even to the point where it was kind of funny and obviously contributed to this album kind of becoming a meme still I think if you look at this album with kind of a postmodern lens I mean yeah you could literally take large musical chunks from older songs sample them and stretch them out slow them down and remix them and loop them in such a way where you're just making new songs which have an appeal and an art stick married independent of the tracks that are actually being sampled I admit to this day that when I hear tracks off a floral shop I do have to kind of stop myself from thinking like uh you just grab this sample and you just stretch it out and that's it yeah I have to kind of prevent myself from feeling that way because when I just sort of turn off that part of my brain and I just listen to what's going on it does sound pretty fun and I feel like if your goal at the end of the day is just to make music that entertains people and stimulates people and evoke some kind of emotion creates a feeling even if your means for doing that is just like stretching out an old R&B or a soul or a synth funk song and just like you know having at it then you know do you next in this list over here I want to give a shout out to the Kreayshawn album something about Crais who some of the younger people watching this video may not even remember as she kind of disappeared off the map pretty quickly after 2012 Kreayshawn exploded onto the scene in 2011 with a single called goochy goochy this was years before gucci gang her music is really braggadocious and kind of trashy she didn't take herself all that seriously most audiences didn't really take her all that seriously when she eventually ended up dropping her album something about cray in 2012 like the sales were absolutely dismal however though in retrospect there were a lot of fun ridiculous bangers on there that I think make more sense in the current context of ridiculous bangers and currently I think we're in an artistic climate where you see so many new refreshing female rappers coming up where if Kreayshawn had kind of hit today maybe her career would have been a bit longer I mean sure there were some aspects of Kreayshawn style that were kind of grating one of the lead singles to her last record was literally a song about breakfast and her entry into the spotlight did lead to some lasting headaches like the popularity of the nasty but honestly in an era of just kind of dumb silly fun crash ons something about cray makes a lot more sense and listening back to this album there were actually some tracks that were kind of cutting edge and even predictive of the current state of pop rap and trap the next record I want to talk about in this list is the Swans album my father will guide me up a rope to the sky this is the band's momentous and their comeback album after having not released a studio record since the mid 90s with soundtracks for the blind and I gave the record at the time of somewhat favorable review I thought it was okay and without question my father is still the least formidable of all of the studio albums swans have released since coming back into the fold but after hearing how the band has effectively built on a lot of the sounds and ideas from this record on the seer on to be kind on the glowing man it's kind of hard to go back and listen to this thing and not admire what michael gira and company are doing to some degree as it would only get more epic and even better from here I also remember at the drop of this album I had a hard time taking it seriously because I saw a lot of what michael gira and company were doing is kind of like a take off of what he was doing previously with angels of light and while in some respects that may be true where he has progressed these sounds in the swans discography in such a way that it kind of calls back and makes sense in the grander scheme of the Bands catalog it's nothing short of impressive and exciting and my father while it may not be the best record the band is put out in this leg of their career it is an essential part of that progression you know in comparison with these two hour-long records my father just kind of feels like a footnote but still there are quite a few tracks on this thing that while they may not be as crushing or as dense or as heavy as many tracks off to be kind they've aged pretty well like no words no thoughts so even if I may not have hyped this album up that much and and maybe fans across the board don't see my father as grand and expression as everything else swans have done this decade do not entirely write this album off because there is a lot of good material on it and it is still a really interesting mix of experimental rock and post rock and folk rock and post-punk assembled together in a way that only swans could the last record that I want to mention on this list is probably the latest example of an album growing on me a little bit and I did mention this in my year-end list as this record did place pretty high on it and that is the playboy cardi album die lit which in terms of current day adlib heavy trap and pop wrap this thing is I don't know a one-of-a-kind experience while it may not seem like a whole lot on the surface cardies use of repet in ad-libs subtly psychedelic instrumentals it does create a kind of odd and even surreal experience one that for whatever reason even though this album is is basic and as repetitive and sometimes as mind-numbing as it is I just keep coming back to it some of the tracks on this thing are fantastically exciting and raw like our IP where playboy cardi's weird nasally baby voice which I admired initially in my review I just love even more now it just hits in such a weird friggin way meanwhile tracks like fell in love feel like I'm floating on a trippy trap cloud I just love in this incredibly aggressive and maximal moment in hip hop playboy cardi has found appeal and true power in just playing it simple not overloading his tracks with too much and not sounding like he's desperate for anybody's attention because as basic as some of the musical and compositional ideas on this record may be its aesthetics its execution there's something truly weird and artful about it that I just can't quite put my finger on but also can't deny the existence of and also can't get enough of and I think I'm going to leave it at that that has been ten more albums I have essentially changed my opinion on quite a bit even if you have heard these albums if it's been a while I recommend that maybe you go back and try them out and see if your opinion on them has changed in any way significantly and I guess I will see you guys the next time later down the road when I have maybe a few more albums that I have some updated comments on I guess a transition I love you thank you for watching Wow maybe leave a comment down below telling me an album that over the past few years your opinion has changed on it massively over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana music forever 
jvLOz_mzZ9k,this new logic album it's uh it's it's not good this is the latest full-length album from Maryland rap artist logic which I'm not even sure if it's fair to call this an album because he's also kind of categorizing it as a sound track because logic is not only just a rapper now he's also like a novelist he has just come out with a novel titled supermarket and this is essentially the soundtrack to it I guess this marriage of mediums isn't totally weird for logic considering that there is a bit of an underlying story on a couple of his past records not something that necessarily impacts heavily the themes behind his songs but you know interstitial narrative bits that portray characters kind of reflecting on how great logic was and how he changed the game and so on and so forth I remember his 2017 record everybody ending with a weird sci-fi bit featuring neil degrasse tyson where you had the main character of the story living these many lives and many experiences of different people but now with supermarket I guess you see a more direct marriage between the music and the narrative in a way I see what logic is doing here is not being that much different than what childish gambino did with his because the internet record dropping a batch of songs meant to soundtrack a screenplay he released at the same time but this is not anything I want to dwell over too much in this review because the narrative the story the book all of that stuff has little to no impact on my feelings on this project really what makes supermaket difficult to swallow is that this is a huge stylistic you know change of pace for logic yes supermarket is partially a rap album logic does rap over a great deal of the songs on this record and there are lots of choruses on this thing that are pulled from other rap songs whether you're talking about Bismarck he's just a friend or a tribe called quest's can I kick it which is nothing new for logic in the grander scheme of things as he is very low on a rich allottee most of the time pulling a lot of his ideas very blatantly and very directly from his contemporaries as well as old-school hip hop acts as well it was something that early on in his career I saw as kind of admirable in that hey this dude is super versatile but then as he continued to grow in profile it became painfully obvious that yeah he's borrowing a lot of ideas but he's not really crafting any of them into anything refreshing or even close to a cutting edge or original at the end of the day it's really more of a crutch for logics lack of creativity and that same lack of creativity carries over as logic decides that he is going to write pop rock songs and acoustic rock songs and indie rock songs yes that is literally what he is doing on this album in a way it's kind of like his speeding bullet to heaven as his attempts here to cross over into these genres absolutely suck the production and instrumentals all over this thing are either very plain and dry and flat lack any sort of textural flavor just very bare acoustic guitars that a lot of the time aren't even played all that well there are obvious blemishes in the playing which hey you know sometimes that happens in lo-fi indie and indie rock but yet the recording on this thing is so clean and pristine it doesn't really complement the somewhat mediocre playing style sometimes the mixing on these tracks isn't even that good the sudden breakbeat transition on Bohemian Rhapsody the drums on that are way louder than they need to be on the track I'm probably going to rock your world the synths there are mixed into the cut like a bull in a china shop they just kind of crash into everything in a really horrid way just take it up way too much room in the mix but honestly the worst thing about the tracks on this thing is just really the songwriting and logic singing his lyricism I mean we've known logic in the past to not be the best lyricist in hip-hop he can write some funny clever one-liners here and there and he's certainly capable of focusing on a topic and even coming off kind of emotionally compelling especially when he's touching down on a significant issue like suicide but goddamn the lyrics on this album our insipid their trite their disgusting there's straight trash the song by the bridge I think is one of the best examples of awful lyricism on this LP in that it features pretty much every lyrical cliche in the book and the song means next to nothing maybe logic sees this track is tying and effectively to a point in the book that means a bit more and it brings in context but seriously reading into the lyrics of this track we do have this kind of narrative device of finding a dead body by the bridge that's kind of a very dramatic point of focus in the song but then logic surrounds this point with just a bunch of faux deep filler that just kind of gives me a headache logic is singing why isn't anybody listening then he's singing about searching inside his soul being let go he's searching more and searching more oh now spreading your wings taking a leap it's just like I'm listening to a bunch of metaphors that add up to literally nothing and when logic isn't putting hollow metaphors out there he's just throwing out cringy stories like on the title track of this thing which yes in the track he does admit that this behavior isn't cool or admirable but the song is essentially about just kind of creeping on this girl you have a crush on at the supermarket that she works at there's also an awful lyric on this track that is like a blatant Radiohead reference that's uh Jesus Christ we also have logic singing about taking a time machine back to save somebody but they just like die anyway on the song time machine it's like I'm listening to a bad bizarro version of Neutral Milk Hotel and I cannot think of the song what is it pretty young girl without laughing at the lyrics like in my head pretty young girl doing pretty young things she's a pretty young lady pulling out my heartstrings also the chord progression on this thing and the way the strings just sort of rush in in the second leg of the track like what do you think this is a Pixies song get the hell out of my face there are so many points on this record where you can hear that logic is just directly ripping off other pop rock and and an alternative rock songs the instrumental and vocals on the track just sound like a really old bad Radiohead song like something off their first that hardcore fans just don't really take seriously now Lemondrop not only features the stomach-churning lyrics of god I can't say it how many licks to lick your lemon drop how many licks to lick your drop drop but also the instrumental the groove nearly everything about this track including logics vocals is just a blatant Red Hot Chili Peppers ripoff maybe there's like a mix of Pharrell in there somewhere but for the most part it sounds like sex magic Red Hot Chili Peppers mixed with a bit of like Californication Red Hot Chili Peppers the sonification from myself features logic literally just doing his best Mack DeMarco impression everything from his voice to the slinky and chill laid-back relaxing soft rock instrumentation in the background it's it's all just Mack DeMarco and from what I've read online Mack DeMarco literally had a hand in the instrumental and production and I'm just wondering like how does that conversation go does logic approach Mack DeMarco and say hey man I have an album coming out and kind of doing a bit of a rock and pop thing on it and I want a song on the record that sounds exactly like you but I want to sing it can you just do an instrumental for me so I can do that on my album I hope Mack DeMarco got a big fat check out of taking part in this awful logic album and allowing logic to do bad Mack DeMarco karaoke on his own record because I don't really see the artistic merit in just helping another artist rip you off on their record so disgusting corny lyrics blatant ripoffs annoying stories and narratives flat bland run-of-the-mill boring instrumentation you have moments like The Closer which while I do appreciate the grand instrumental and vocal layers on that track what a frigging patronizing song I think you're beautiful I think you're funny I think you're smart don't give a fuck about the Monday I just catch awful whiffs from Coldplay and maybe you like some bad acoustic ballads from Green Day you know as bad as speeding bullet to heaven was one thing that I could appreciate about Kid Cudi's efforts on that record was that you know they were pretty raw and at least it seemed like he had decent taste in alternative rock and grunge he was pulling from interesting points of inspiration he also had the talent in the artistry to pen some lyrics that were maybe a bit abstract sure laughable at points but at least abstract and strange kind of evocative on the flip side with supermarket nearly everything logic says on this record is either blatantly on the nose or utterly meaningless also the mix of sources logic is so obviously ripping off on this record to me displays just a very basic and bland view of rock music like if you're gonna make a sudden transition into this genre and the first artist you're going to pull inspiration from are like the Pixies Radiohead Mac DeMarco and Red Hot Chili Peppers that's that's um let me try to put it this way if Jack White came out with a hip-hop album tomorrow and it basically just sounded like all he listened to was biggie and jay-z yeah that'd be pretty funny and we would not be laughing with Jack White we would be laughing at him yeah there is not a single track on this thing that I think is good whether you're talking about the dreamy almost kind of a chill wavy atmospheres of DeLorean the sickening cloying dramatic acoustic and Atmospheric aesthetic of I'm probably gonna rock your world which is a track for me that is doubly disgusting because it you know makes me think of logics Oh face and and that's the last thing I want in my head we are in truly sad times right now this is the wrong timeline I'm not really sure if I have anything else to say about this project other than that but goddamn logic really outdid himself this time in in a way sure I could go into some of them awful and corny bars that logic drops throughout this album when he does manage to throw a rap verse in some of the beat transitions during those moments are okay in fact I would say those spots make for the most tolerable points on the album but they are so few and far between that is just merely a side dish to the main focus of this album and it is again logics songwriting or lack thereof I am going to leave it at that this logic project it's not good position have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it well you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana logic

0NfVnIqy8-I,I'm feeling knocking silly man hi everyone silly you silly Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new American football self-titled album lp3 yeah another self-titled album from the legendary Illinois emo outfit American football who just released the come back to their 1999 album just a few years ago in 2016 which was also self-titled I was not a huge fan of the band's return album a few years ago that's that's been made clear and I don't think I was the only person who enjoyed American footballs earlier material that was kind of disappointed the band is known to be mellow yes but the sound of this return album was incredibly flaccid not just in terms of performance but also just songwriting quality and like any major band that has put out some good music takes a break comes back with a so-so record I walked away from this album hoping that they would stick with it and just improve down the road and I think lp3 is actually that improvement but for sure American football they're not writing barnburners on this one still Mike Kinsella and company do return with a prettier and a fuller sound that I think kind of modernizes the sparkly and euphoric but also melancholy vibe that American football is known for there's actually something so pristine and kind of sterile about the sound of the tracks on this record it kind of reminds me of the work of Ben Gibbard whether you're talking about a his postal service stuff or his years with Death Cab for Cutie after the band kind of made their mainstream transition there's also a pretty large influx a fairly gorgeous arranged instrumentation thrown into the mix on this thing like these strings and vocal harmonies and even viber phones that are worked into the opening track silhouettes Steve zooms on drums gives this lush ocean of instrumentation a strong and a crisp rhythmic backbone I think without it these tracks would feel kind of blobby and generally across the entire album there is a great balance between the sharp percussion on this thing the rich instrumentation and vocals thrown on top there are also a few nice changes of pace provided by some guest singers brought into the fold on this album a few who come from Bay who no doubt have been greatly inspired by the early work of American football whether you're talking about Elizabeth Powell of the band land of talk whose French refrains on the track every wave to ever rise bring a nice chilly breeze into this tracks multi-phased and progressively dreary structure toward the back end of this track there's a lot of repetition and gently intensifies like a really good classic post rock song which is not really surprising considering the band's early work kind of dabbled in that sound as American football was definitely not a meat-and-potatoes emo band I love even more hearing Hayley Williams of Paramore Fame on the track uncomfortably numb really the records most straightforward and catchy tune uncomfortably numb for whatever reason another moment on the album where cansel is incredibly gentle youthful light voice reminds me of ben gibbard 'he's it's just a weird similarity I can't shake but still it doesn't impede on my enjoyment this album also features Rachel gasps well of slow dive whose dreamy and luscious and shoegazing production has no doubt been a huge influence especially on this new American football album her vocal appearance on I can't feel you may not exactly be as involved as Hayley's but her gentle and Atmospheric and chilly vocals do provide a very nice contrast from the busy and bustling guitars and drums underneath American football kind of throwing it back once again to the math rock roots that so many fans love about their early work so the guest appearances and generally the production on this album are pretty good but really it is the quality songwriting that I think puts lp3 far above LP to the song heir-apparent is another one of my favorite songs on this thing which sets the stage with these reverb so cascading guitar lines this very sudden and smooth transition into a fantastic chorus bittersweet in its apology for essentially ending a relationship and if this fantastic little hook isn't enough there is this really pretty bunch of group female vocals that are brought into the fold toward the end of the track that sing this pretty haunting mantra about sort of being the heir apparent to throne the king of all alone now LP three does not really overstay its welcome that much at 47 minutes it is also an eight-track album however not every one of those tracks in my opinion our highlight one major downside of this LP in my opinion just like LP two is that occasionally the production on this thing is so dang sterile clean to the point where it is annoyingly flawless some of the guitar soloing in the backing instrumentation on Duman full-bloom sounds like something off of a really bad boomer jazz rock record the kind of album you would love if you just like couldn't stop talking about Jeff Beck and you've invested ten or twenty thousand dollars in a home studio and yet you've never recorded a single track and that's just the second half of the song the first leg is actually some really bland sparkly elevator rock that I just can't stand the song mine to miss is okay it's one of the jam ear cuts on the entire LP and mostly goes by forget ibly and just kind of a breezy fashion I think it's track that could stand out a lot more with some added instrumental muscle or maybe a stronger tune and honestly on the closing track here I do find the song to be a little winding I do think the build-up at the first leg of the track is a bit long-winded however I do like the way the very direct and lush string sections play very steadily against the mathematical guitars in the mix there's also a pretty haunting refrain at the end of this track that I think ties up this album's themes of breaking up and loneliness well overall lp3 is a very good album and is the record that LP - should have been I'm certainly looking forward to hearing American football grow past this album and hopefully they pick up a bit of grit in the process find more ways to I guess vary up the sound of their album's track to track bring more variety the dreamy and somewhat shoegaze a direction the band is moving in on this one also shows quite a bit of promise I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit

A3yllffO0dc,uh this nav album it's no please anything but this you're doing it two times to my boy it's the greatest rapper it's not good nav is a songwriter rapper and auto crooner from the great country of Canada this is his latest full-length album I first heard of this dude back in 2017 through his self-titled LP this album didn't really strike me as anything special at the time and there wasn't really any reason to kind of ring the alarms just hearing another forgettable nondescript auto croon trap record I hear so many of those week in and week out again hearing another one wasn't really a big deal around the time this record came out I mostly remember focusing on other things shortly after the release of this record we had the nav and Metro boomin collab perfect timing and then in 2018 nabs profile seemed to grow with the release of his next full-length album reckless which I did end up covering I said the album was not good and the reason I ended up talking about this record was the hype building behind nav on this album let me put it this way when it comes to NAB's last full-length album I'm not really sure if there's a nice thing I can say the instrumentals and the beat choices NAB makes on this record absolutely suck totally bland totally run-of-the-mill nothing fun or exciting or hard-hitting or even intoxicating about them I'm not saying NAB's instrumentals are like the worst thing I've ever heard in my life but there's absolutely positively nothing special about them whatsoever then let's move on to NAB's singing is rapping the vocals generally which are about as expressionless as I think current day vocals in hip-hop get during a time when it seems like rappers are doing everything they can to stand out and be wild and be crazy and scream their brains out and go absolutely mad nav is kind of an anomaly I actually likened his vocals on his last record to that of a robot mimicking the sound of a human voice when it comes to the substance of Knab songs there's not really anything particularly special about that either just vary by the numbers and run-of-the-mill braggadocio and as of grandeur which is typical for this style of music typical for this genre not necessarily a bad thing but typically bold claims and hip-hop come along with bold wordplay bold flows bold personalities that make it all kind of believable now I know up until this point I've been talking a lot about NAB sound his style his last album and the reason I've hung in this area for so long is that pretty much everything that applies to NAB's last record also applies to this new album over here his voice is still incredibly nasal incredibly flat horrid emotionless absolutely boring at this moment in time I still cannot name a more boring rapper and singer in hip hop than now I think Nev is hip-hop's most non-essential character at the moment there's absolutely nothing that his music his sound his style brings to the table he picks the most run-of-the-mill forgettable beats his songs and their structures are very plain very basic the energy he brings to his songs is for the most part non-existent I guess what I can give nav on this album is that there are some bars and lines that are unintentionally funny like on the track I'm ready where he literally says what's the game without me like you literally bring nothing to the game right now on top of it you like quit a while ago like you claim that you are quitting music and the entire internet clowned you if nav never came out with another album ever again the game would look exactly the same it would progress the exact same way arguably nabs biggest point of exposure was at the end of that Travis Scott song where everybody made a huge joke of how low he was mixed also on the track Taking Chances nav drops this bar about selling his soul but if Navis had a soul I have not heard it yet not on one of his songs he has the audacity to put a song on this thing titled price on my head and this song actually features The Weeknd who delivers believe it or not an absolutely horrid feature throughout his vocal passages he's kind of like slipping back and forth in between this falsetto castrato vocal range and it's uh II some of the worst vocals he's laid to tape but still even with me not caring for Abel's voice that much on this track hearing him is actually kind of a breath of fresh air from the soulless and monotone and absolutely mind-numbing rapping and singing from nav for the duration of this album in fact nearly every feature on this record is a nice breath of fresh air from NAB's horridly boring voice Meek Mill provides a pretty decent feature on here and young thug goes way harder on this record then he ever really needed to he also admits to wanting to have sex with his aunt so you know there's there's also that there's an unexpected beats which on this track that miraculously somehow makes the song worse you would figure it would be the opposite given just how one-dimensional most of the songs on this thing are and that may be a switch would kind of bring a nice change of pace make these songs on this thing more dynamic but know it actually becomes more difficult to listen to sadly the album doesn't get any better as it progresses in its final moments the song why you cry in mono despite the lyrics being his heartfelt and as personal as they are NAB doesn't really put any more heart into this track than he does any other song here it's just as flat and is boring and is sonically nondescript as the rest of the record I will say the closing track and they tracked your runners both of these songs have beats that go relatively hard much harder than some of the other cuts on the record and nab brings some decent flows to these songs as well but Jesus like he really does need more than just like an OK flow and an okay beat to get by there needs to be something there interesting in terms of lyrics that doesn't even need to be deep or substantive or conscious or anything like that I don't know something clever something funny and observation of some type something titillating or exciting or fun and still just the vocal delivery is absolutely drab honestly I'm in a really weird place right now because I want to say that nav is the most forgettable rapper working today but I feel like in how uniquely forgettable and run-of-the-mill he is he somehow has created an identity he is unique in that he literally has so little going for him artistically speaking he's like so devoid anything interesting going on in his music it's it's actually kind of shocking yeah honestly shocked despite how many songs and how many projects this guy has under his belt and he still cannot come up with a compelling track if you put a gun in my mouth and you told me to write down the characteristics of an AB song the only thing I could think to write down would be just make sure nothing absolutely stands out and just make sure you have a very tiny nasally voice with an utter lack of emotion I mean some people have tried to sell me on the idea that hey this new record of his it's his best record it's better than his last album but but no this still sucks maybe the beats are a bit bigger and they hide the flaws of Navs voice a bit better but geez like that's it this noon a Val b'm it's not good position have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next to the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit

6LFIvvx23_o,ah hi everyone anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for a review of the new Stella Donnelly album beware of the dogs this is the debut full-length album of Australian singer-songwriter and secretly Canadian signee Stella Donnelly whose record here has been turning a lot of heads in the indie scene even I was pretty impressed with how fun and catchy lead-up tracks like tricks were on this record now I admit I wasn't really tuned into a Stella was doing back in 2017 on her thrush metal EP but her sound still felt eerily familiar once I actually got the opportunity to hear this entire album on the instrumental side of this LP you're looking at some pretty standard soft sometimes jangly indie rock and pop the guitars and drums on this thing usually fall somewhere on a spectrum between the slick easygoing and sweet sounds of Mack DeMarco but then also the dreamy euphoric synth pop vibes of beach house on bistro and watching telly then there are a handful of cuts that are super stripped back to some very lonely guitars and Stella's very nasal and kind of polite vocal delivery which does lead to a few sleepier moments on the record in my opinion there are a few spots where I'm just wanting more from the instrumentals on this album the song lunch is a prime example where Stella vocally is really selling the track but the instrumental utterly fails to escalate the emotion of the song to give her singing more impact and there are a few tracks on here that feel heavily indebted to the jangle pop and twee pop of the 1980s the songs die as well as season's greetings tracks that don't exactly provide a new spin on these sounds but they are a few of the most fun and peppy tracks on the entire record the performances aren't that bad either they do a pretty decent job of recapturing a sound and a vibe there is a bit of standout soloing and melody writing as well especially on the song tricks where some of the guitar playing seems to be purposely ridiculous Stella's singing on this record does have some high points but I'm not completely sold on it either I do like the youthful and kind of girlish tone but there's not a whole lot of presence to it at least some of the time because I do think there are a good deal of performances here where she does come through with a lot of emotional conviction she digs deep she gets shouty or even laughs mid-performance I think the title track on this thing is actually a great example of Stella showing off quite a bit of anger and emotion and and and volume and pitch control the tracks on this album I love the most are the ones where Stella comes through with the most commanding vocal performances honestly the songs where she's more subdued and feels more emotionless than emotional just don't do too much for me but I'm not trying to tear this album down from front to back or anything like that I know I've been sort of talking about a lot of my gripes with it I actually like this record overall even if it does come off a little bland on the surface because I think Stella's greatest talents on this album really come through on her songwriting her ability to focus on a topic and I do think she creates a bit of a lane for herself with the themes on this album there are quite a few songs here approaching things like sexism and the gender divide the way these things are sort of reinforced culturally through religion and traditional values we also have the opening track old man which seems to center around this sexist guys advances and Creepo behavior there's also the chilling boys will be boys which focuses on just excusing rape and rape culture also there are some tracks on this thing that focus on young crushes as well as love on the rocks with some odd situations and reference points the song mosquito has Stella showing off this intense sexual desire for this person she has in mind from masturbation fantasies to comparing herself to a malaria mosquito just circling around a light that she's obsessed with and also wanting to bring this person a cake but they're allergic and this isn't the only time on the album that allergies sort of turn up in a romance scenario they also do on the song allergies want to go back once again to the song tricks which I absolutely love the connection Stella has to the person she's focusing on with this track I'm not entirely sure of she's obviously hanging around this person it seems like it could be physical but the standpoint from where she's singing she clearly sees this person as ridiculous as she consistently highlights his totally detestable behavior and even points out things about him like his southern cross tattoo which if you know anything about stray 'its it's a you know tacky tattoo choice also I love the lyrical bit on this track where she should have rhymed with the f-word but then she says you know you want to get laid and it turns into this like stretched out weird reverb II psychedelic transition you know Stella shows a real knack on this record for being able to approach these really dark and emotional and and super significant topics but then also being able to tie in these songs that bring a lot of levity to this album show quite a bit of humor show her being kind of cheeky which adds to the personality factor of this album a lot as far as modern indie pop and rock goes beware of the dogs is a solid record hopefully in the future from Stella we get bolder instrumental choices and ideas that do a better job to support and reflect the unique stories and lyrical angles that she presents in her songs at its best this album is captivating it is heart-wrenching it is quirky it is sweet at its worst it's a little generic and kind of underwhelming or even under written like on the song bistro which lyrically just kind of reads like an elongated filler motif right in the middle of the record the issues that I have with this album I mostly chalk up to debut record blues to Stella still being in a position where she's kind of finding her sound regardless there's a lot of great raw talent on this thing and easily some of the best indie rock and pop I've heard in 2019 I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the

LlZ6X7SqmZ0,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd it is time for our weekly track roundup where I go over the tracks that I thought were the best and the not-so-best of this

kicked back from it supports the segment supports the channel and here are the worst tracks of the week in my opinion first off the new logics on can song confessions of a dangerous mind it's got a decent instrumental it has an OK flow but do not be fooled everyone ok this is this is a bad corny PSA masquerading as a rap song ok that's that's actually what what it is and yeah yeah that's it's actually what it is I have falling through review of it over on the Fantana channel if you want to hear me talk about it a little bit more but that's kind of the gist of my opinion on the track moving out from there the new boo dose band song veil of shadows has some admirable elements to it but the horrid reverb II soul-sucking production takes away any potential appeal that this track has unfortunately hopefully the rest of this new record is not exactly like this I'm hoping there's a bit more meat on the bone sonically as far as the production goes on this new album moving on from their Broken Social Scene has a brand new track out titled can't find my heart which is pretty much like a very generic melodramatic piece of indie rock with absolutely no personality to it kind of shocking considering the wealth of artistic minds and instrumentation Broken Social Scene usually has it their disposal it doesn't really seem to be bearing out on this new track over here sadly and let's move on to the tracks that I thought were kind of met you know not blown me away but not you know terrible either first off this new Tierra wack cut okay she has a new song I titled unemployed I admire that she's been dropping one single after another over the past few weeks this however is is maybe my least favorite of the bunch she does have some decent quotables and a cool flow on this cut but the instrumental is really just kind of like a generic trap beat without much in the way of anything memorable memorable about it frankly moving on from there we have this brand-new cut over here from tame impala Kevin Parker Kevin Parker Kevin Parker Kevin Parker is back new album on the way people been freaking out about this brand new song and yeah I think it's ok I think it's got some nice groovy rhythms on it it's got some glam vibes it's got some synth pop vibes got some disco vibes but Kevin Parker's vocals at the core of this song really do leave a lot to be desired and song wise I just think the track is is truly just out to lunch honestly moving on from their brand-new track from pronoun didn't love this track as much as I did the previous one from this project but I do like the peppy power pop energy coming off of this new song quite a bit temporary tantrum is the title of it moving on from there come at the scene and ASAP rocky have teamed up on a brand new song or rather remix of the track walk which in my opinion does kind of breathe new life into this song I'm still out of like a super big come at the scene fan or anything but I do feel like building the track out and bringing a SAP on to the cut which I honestly I think is one of his more solid features in a while has has improved the track quite a bit moving on from there we have a V ter horse new song and music video album that people are the anco fans are freaking out about and honestly not too crazy about it myself you know it's got a pretty straightforward ballad on it it is a very listenable and gentle piece of psychedelic folk but even though I wasn't crazy about his last record I think a lot of the sounds on that album sounded riskier than what he's doing here more adventurous than what he's doing here this to my ears just sounds um you know very average for a V certainly not as terrible as anything that he you know some of the worst records he's dropped in the past but you know just seems very run-of-the-mill in my opinion moving on from there an open E has a new track out titled Karma which has some very lonely linear guitar lines on it you know very linear progression as well I guess you know some repetitive vocal lines and stuff that I wish you know changed up a bit more as the track move forward but still the vocal performance is nice the guitar playing is nice it does a very kind of eerie chilling and dreary vibe to the song that I like quite a bit so if you like your a artpop dark and chilled do do try this one out moving on from there we have the best tracks of the week the ones that really wowed me the ones that really left the largest impression on me let's start with snoo track from a wise blood movies which is an elegantly composed piece of art pop with some great instrumentation surrounding the ballad I love the music video it's attached to as well this has easily become one of my most anticipated pop records of the year so really looking forward to that also this new track from wand the band's latest material has really been wowing me liking the psyche rock vibes the band is pulling together but this new track over here plays it a little straighter a bit drier of a sound kind of a power pop energy to it that I think is really cool and you know it's nicer sounding a little versatile as they're building up to this new record of theirs Kweli Chris currently I would say the most underrated rapper in Detroit has a new record on the way every teaser from it so far has been stellar and this new track over here Obamacare is also stellar in fact it is the grittiest and grimy ax song he has offered from this new album Gunz so far and also features an absolutely hilarious hook and ya just really looking forward to hearing this record because it's it's currently one of my most anticipated hip-hop records of the year moving on from there pup has a couple of new tracks out sibling rivalry and Scorpion Hill they've been dropping a lot of fire in preparation for their new record and I'm really loving the mix of gritty and gruff pop punk and an emo on their latest material their new record I again I certainly think it's shaping up to maybe be their best as right now moving on from there Mavis Staples has a brand new track out change which i think is pretty great it's got some pretty standard vocals from her and kind of a rustic bluesy you know build and progression but I do love the protest song element of what she's saying in her lyrics so much it does bring the track a great energy and appeal to my ears lizzo has a brand new track that she's been hyping out and I mean hyping up and freaking out about this week and this week because it features her hero Missy Elliott on it and she does have a very nice section around the bridge of the song which kind of hypes it up a little bit it's nice but really the selling point of the track is truly lizzo as with all her latest material she just kind of continues to kill and just brings this incredible wit and aura and energy to her tracks and you know great vocals great flow and a huge huge huge Basie instrumental that is absolutely exciting on the track also diggin on this new Jamila woods song a nice blend of kind of alternative artsy R&B a bit of a throwback some neo soul vibes on this cut as well that I thought were quite nice and she has a new record on the way so keep an eye an ear out for what she is doing to I know I will be also digging on the new injury reserve song jailbreak the Tesla featuring and yeah I'm kind of surprised by the risks that the trio are taking on this new crop of tracks the music video left me scratching my head because it kind of felt like like a really weird Tesla commercial ominous verse was absolutely hilarious loved the Elan and Grimes references loved the kind of industrial club trapped elements of the instrumental Ritchie's verse to me felt like super materialistic but was it a statement on that is it just like a weird flex then there's all these like lines about hacking into the Tesla it's a really weird cut it's it's incredibly odd and again really uh admiring the the risks and the moves the other trio are making as of late including that track and the last song that I wanna give a shout out to in this segment is the newest track from full of Hell burning myrrh and typically I'm not really all that wowed by a lot of full of hells you know solo band efforts but honestly for a track that from then is not a collaborative one this one does have quite a bit of energy and color to it I love the way the blood-curdling shrieks and growls and everything in between kind of layer on top of each other and a really horrid nasty way on this track and yeah just really enjoying what the what the band is doing on this new song hopefully we hear a nastier sounds from them in the future on this new full-length album of theirs on the way and that is gonna be it for the weekly track roundup I think everybody yeah thank you for watching hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this video once more shout out to the ridge for sponsoring us continuation of the

roundup forever 
5_ygpHqUm54,hi everyone whoa Kenny here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new flu mixtape hi this is flume this is a new out-of-the-blue mixtape from Australian music producer flume who we have not heard from in a longer project capacity and in quite a while not since 2016 when we saw flume drop his last full length album skin a project that presented flume pulling from the same base of underground electronic ideas that we knew him to do up until this point the glitch hop the wonky stuff the future bass but then kind of amping it up and giving it this gigantic pristine EDM style presentation I guess trying to bring himself and these sounds to a wider audience and even if the critical reception of this record may have been a little mixed I still think flumes plan on this album worked as this record did kind of grow his profile with a big sound and even bigger list of features people like Vince staples and Raekwon and alunageorge at the time they've sort of fallen off recently little dragon even back now around a time where you would be expecting flume to have a new album coming out around the corner instead he's coming out with a mix tape and also instead of reaching for that brass ring of Commercial Appeal it's kind of like he's going more experimental on this one maybe it's him feeling the freedom to let loose on the mixtape format I'm not sure but what I can say is I think flumes sound pallets on this record are a lot more varied than they've been in the past more creative and thought-provoking feels a lot less like an outright commercial bastardization of these sounds and more like an embrace of what makes them weird while also attempting to elevate them into space for an intergalactic journey the tracks on this mixtape are a little on the short side yes nothing as lengthy or even as labored over as a lot of the material on skin but flume creatively transitions these songs into one another throughout this entire mixtape so it does feel like a pretty holistic and connected experience for example the plucky and pitched he's the factory floor beats and grime rappers don't sigh all of them melt perfectly on the Songhai beams and create a pretty gritty and gorgeous sound which the song jewel transitions from amazingly almost like the song were a compositional extension of the previous one with its gorgeous and glitchy synth melodies what sounds like a religious champion fit through a weird robot filter also the futuristic and bright drones of Dreamtime transition really seamlessly into the kind of stunning remix of Sophie's is it cold in the water where flume teams up with EEPROM and gives the track a bit more variation and a lot more of a percussive backbone and even though some of the beats added into this track are kind of rigid in their groove I do kind of like the noisy sharp abrasive quality they bring to the cut there are also a load of tracks on the back end of this thing that are about one minute and change that all connect in this one elongated mix of industrial banger beats harmonious alien since weird distortions weird vocal samples a few unlikely nods to different electronic music styles the song mud features these trap hi-hats rattling away against these walls of sub-zero tundra synthesizers that are so frigid they're hot it's like dry ice song 71 m3 has these stuttering wonky beats matched with some forlorn and strange vocal samples that sound like they're lifted out of a an old Crystal Castles record the song vitality has one of the weirdest mixes of ideas on the entire record this classic hip-hop groove coming out of the beat all these nasty metallic Timbers on the percussion and then a bunch of ethereal tones that feel like they're coming from a vaporwave song flume also goes kind of low Phi on the track upgrade which has quick hit after a quick hit of these distorted shimmering I see synth arpeggios and occasional techno rhythm popping in for a second and there are a few great features on this mixtape as well like Sophie who is not just remixed but featured too on these song voices the makeup of this track is a little mysterious it might not have grabbed my attention if not for the feature credits on it because it does feel like a weird little vocal interlude that is not one of the boldest or loudest cuts on the record it's just like a low-key in between two of the more engaging and busy tracks on the album but still a beautiful and strange Oasis on this record and transitions to and from effectively from the tracks surrounding it also the amazing jpeg mafia verse that is dropped on this tape is really impressive - I'm actually really surprised to hear not only some of his hardest bars in a while on this thing you know there are a lot of interesting bits and tracks just kind of flying by at the speed of light on hi this is flume but the strength of this project really comes down to how all of the songs connect to each other just to create this weird linear sonic adventure a whole ton of colorful weird ear candy given the release of projects like more life over the past few years where we've heard some pretty major artists essentially turn their cutting room floor into a record into a mixtape into a whatever this project right here next to me on the wall is a nice refreshing change of pace from the mediocrity that we've been hearing from records like that nothing on this mixtape is too overdone as it was on skin and maybe some of what we're hearing here may in fact just be like cobbled together but sometimes the magic of what you're doing comes down more to how you present it and how you execute it yes there are a lot of weird short one-off moments throughout this project but they're all guided in a way where they reinforce each other really well and again it is worth noting that overall the material on this thing is a kind of experimental change of pace for flume which I hope to hear him indulge a bit more in in the future I'm not under the impression that this is one of the greatest or deepest or most cutting-edge projects I've heard ever certainly it is rough around the edges it's kind of lightning in a bottle in ways that also benefit it but also disadvantage it a little bit would love to hear flume continuing to sound this adventurous but with a bigger and a better sound on future projects feeling a light eight on this one transition have you given this mixtape a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit that you like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the Bellas well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana boom hi this is flume for 
DiQRvZgMibw,hi everyone wreaths any view tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for me to go over how I listen to an album ears use your ears yeah that that is literally how one hears but this was gonna be more about my methodology well for my meth head oMG it stairs stairs okay well you guys know essentially what I'm trying to get at here I'm sure over the years a lot of people have asked me to give some kind of insight into my process on reviewing and listening to albums so I would like to think for my personal album reviewing process there are kind of three key stages that I go through first there is a discovery phase the discovery phase is super preliminary it is super surface level essentially what we are talking about here is reaching the point where I decide what to review which does involve quite a bit of listening but there are a load of contextual factors that play into my decision-making as well if you guys are familiar and you should be with just how saturated the internet is with content how saturated the music market is with albums and singles and EPS you know that they're like hundreds of releases that I could be covering listening to talking about any given week I'm aware of really only even a fraction of and even that fraction that I'm aware of is still far too big for me to cover entirely and that's essentially where this discovery process comes in me listening to a gauntlet of records going through a lot of albums deciding what is hitting what's not what I have a strong opinion on what I'm kind of reacting to whether that be positive whether that be negative whether I really have anything to say about the record or the artists work because most of everything that I hear day in and day out I don't really love it I don't really hate it I just think it's okay and it's probably the same for all of you too I really do have to dig through a lot of records a lot of suggestions before I come to something that truly moves me and excites me I do try to account for albums that are maybe a bit more subtle or rely a lot less on a visceral response as some albums like that may not reveal what exactly is so great about them right off the bat this part of the process it's very messy it's very fast it isn't perfect as over the years there have been records that I found going back that I totally missed or I forgot to keep track of or initially I may have not been that interested in but that's where I might take other things into account like am I getting a lot of requests to talk about this record does it seem to have a passionate authentic organic following behind it because if so maybe I am missing something and I should go back and try it one or two more times just to see if it ends up clicking with me even though this phase may not be the most detail-oriented it is one of the harder phases because of how much I have to filter through the second phase in this three-tiered thing I would like to think is sort of like a surface level phase this is the point at which I'm pretty committed to reviewing an album and I'm mostly just listening in a casual setting not trying to overthink everything that I'm listening to probably just having it out headphones and doing other things like you guys might be doing when you're listening to music though I try not to engage in anything that would distract my mind too much from what I'm listening to mostly just like busy needy work or like you know working out exercise that kind of thing I might take a walk as well essentially I'm just trying to soak the album in on a nice pair of headphones not try to write or jot anything down unless I feel like I have some kind of like stroke of genius or whatever but again not writing too much because I'm not trying to commit myself to an opinion or an idea right out of the gate because I am just starting to listen to the album I'm still figuring it out and not 100% of what my opinion is yet I'm essentially observing what are the most obvious characteristics of the album that I'm listening to what's the length what's the style what's the genre what's the mood is it sad aggressive happy and anywhere in between emotion wise what is the recording quality like are there any obvious Musical or stylistic comparisons that are coming to mind how many tracks are there are their skits what are the performances like is the energy of the album intense Laidback is it kind of trippy basically trying to make note of the same sorts of things that you guys might tell me if I asked you in 10 seconds write down every word you would use to describe my shirt it's red it has buttons it's plaid it looks like it's made of this kind of material is it baggy is it slim fit all that kind of stuff so after we've moved through this and I basically gathered all these very surface level observations we move on to what is essentially the in-depth and the writing phase this is the point at which I'm listening to the album the most I'm also listening to the album pretty intensely with no other major distractions this is the moment where I've mostly figured out what my opinion is and I'm kind of hammering out the details of that and pulling from the album what exactly makes it tick and what is driving me to feel the way that I do about it I'm trying to make note of what the production is like what is the mix like what are the progressions of the song structures like how does the entire album play from front to back is there a theme does it flow well does every song sound the friggin same I will not only be listening on headphones during this phase but I'll also be trying to sample the record on like a larger stereo so I can get a fuller feel for the record now during this phase of the listening process my opinions on albums can change pretty drastically as there are some records that do sound really good when you put them on in the background they have a nice vibe they have a nice aesthetic but when you dive in deeper to what are the lyrics saying like how do the tracks progress like what is the structure of the song and listen I think aesthetics are great in all artistic mediums and they are an essential piece of sort of finding your artistic voice but for some albums and some musical acts unfortunately once you pull back that esthetics mask you kind of go beyond that you find that the inner workings of what you're observing maybe isn't really that great isn't really that substantive you know might just be basic as hell I'm not going to go through a list here or anything but there are some records that do sort of feel like whoa this could be like an 8 out of 10 or one of my favorite albums of the year when I'm in that more surface level stage but once I kind of move past that and I'm listening to only the album with no distractions and the record has to hold up as a main course not just a side dish to whatever else I'm doing in that context of closer scrutiny some records just don't hold up or I find that some records are pretty good at bringing a thematic sound a big idea maybe even a distinct personality but then the details buried underneath all of it are not really that interesting which I understand that not all people listen to music that way and that's totally fine but honestly as someone who reviews music formally who covers it for a living I would think that my audience would think less of me if they were to know that I only listen to like albums on in the background and when I'm doing my reviews I'm not really paying attention and again casual listening is fine there's nothing inherently wrong with casual listening I like listening to records casually my favorite ones when I'm not doing work but when I am working and when I am reviewing that's not really the mode that I'm in over the course of this final section of the listening process I will also be writing down a lot of notes a lot of descriptions comparisons if I can make them or if I feel like they're relevant I'll try to write down an intro as well to the entire review I'm not really gonna go into what exactly is my writing process as of right now I'm just letting you know that during this phase I'm also doing some writing to to kind of gather together and more solidify exactly what it is I'm thinking hearing and feeling so that I'm not just continually listening to the album and kind of just losing track of what it is I think and feel because I'm not like making note of it and I think that's everything they have to say as of right now in terms of my listening process when it comes to the albums that I review on my channel pretty much everyday hopefully you guys got something out of this video and and just a bit more of an understanding of what it is I do and how I do it you're the best transition have you ever listened to an album or a song tell me about it in the comments I would be interested to know over here next to my head is another

GXetnBHF1oY,hi everyone were City best you know here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another edition of our worst - best series where I go over what albums I am ranking essentially from the worst to the best in a particular artists discography this time it's Weezer the legendary 90s alternative rock band yes they have quite a lengthy discography still adding to it but I felt that now was a good time to maybe go over and reassess what exactly the highlights in the band's discography are up until this point from the blue album to the black album I will be going over every major studio release from Weezer here we go for some people it may seem kind of premature to put one of Weezer's latest records as the worst record in this list but I don't think that's the case I mean for Weezer certainly could get worse from here but in my cold dead reviewer heart I do firmly believe this album should be in this spot I think this album perfectly exemplifies what Weezer fans are complaining about most of the time when it comes to the turn the band's music has taken over the years instead of sticking to their guns and embracing the sound and the ethos of the music that got them to where they are today Weezer is completely content to embrace whatever awful cliche ideas are trending in the mainstream Matt whatever moment and Pacific daydream sees the band doing that essentially with the bright shimmery mostly synthetic sounds of millennial pop what's worse is Rivers Cuomo is very strange and unique system of syllables and spreadsheets when it comes to songwriting yeah it's led to quite a few really impersonal and formulaic songs that don't really have much substance to them it's like I'm listening to random ideas cobbled together but tied up in a very nice bow like on Lamantia Screwjob or on get right which is a pretty exuberant and righteous rock song but doesn't really feel like it's getting to the heart of anything from the sunny atmospheres to the slick beats and the whoa choruses Weezer really has nothing to do on this album then play catch up with the likes of Foster the People and imagine dragons I will say there are some fans out there that I think are a little too dismissive when it comes to rivers as he ages wanting to write pop music for a pop audience I mean how many artists are in the mainstream and over the hill but essentially still want to write songs for young audiences not that many I mean there's Pharrell I guess what I'm trying to say is that in concept I'm fine with it but I don't think Rivers is particularly good at it as it results in some sickeningly sweet cuts on this records such as feels like summer and happy hour there are a couple of very admirable ballads in the tracklist here that features some quality songwriting the rich and triumphant weekend woman is great also I love the very sad and acoustic QB blitz River songwriting when it's good it still shines even when he's dragging Weezer sound through the dregs of mainstream pop trends that are gonna go stale in three years in hindsight I do respect the band's attempts on this album at trying to create a true-blue pop album that embraces modernity that embraces California that embraces the sound of a new generation it is well-intentioned but ill-conceived [Music] Weezer's 2005 album make-believe is my next album in this list it marks the band's first big collaboration with Rick Rubin and even though at the time this record did chart higher than any Weezer album previously in retrospect by a lot of hardcore fans it is seen as the group's real fall from grace it's actually a miracle that the Weezer fanbase had any goodwill toward the band left within it after the release of this album and that's not to say that make-believe doesn't have its tolerable tracks doesn't have its emotional moments like the other way but the memory of this album is more defined by the plethora of radio friendly pop punk and alternative rock tunes that feature these obnoxious earworm choruses that just churn my stomach like Beverly Hills or we are all on drugs tracks whose negative qualities actually contribute to them getting stuck in your head and not in a good way but when make-believe isn't being flat-out irritating it's just kind of going in one ear and out the other with some of the most soulless pop rock the band has ever recorded the sound of this thing is squeaky clean it's low impact which is unfortunate given the band's knack for pop songwriting on green and blue given how heavy and hard-hitting much of maladroit was clearly Weezer's continued bid for mainstream attention panned out and make believe financially but in retrospect it's easy to see why many look at make-believe as one of the Bands most stylistically bankrupt albums [Music] Weezer's 2009 record rata to dwell ong time fans consider to be their worst just the worst and yeah it's for good reason it's hard to imagine a more effective way for Weezer to jettison their original fanbase than to do a hip hop crossover with little Wayne v-line okay bitches it's Weezer and Weezy suggests that the creative thrusts behind the track isn't that much different than those nerdy t-shirts that mash together two pieces of pop-culture because they can be punned and given the track is called can't stop partying you would think the band would at least have the decency to bring on Andrew W K but no all that being said though R attitude does climb up a bit higher on list here because I do see it as a somewhat riskier stab at pop songwriting than its predecessor make believe was it also reflected a pretty extensive batch of collaborators and up to this point Weezer had been a pretty insular act so in a way I do kind of admire the commitment and sheer audacity that Weezer and rivers showed on this record the opening track and lead single from this record is kind of cute though and for the most part what R attitude lacks is execution and even if rivers approach to mainstream pop on this record is little tongue in cheek which it might be the lyrics are still far too dumbed down and annoying it's really a no-brainer that this album would end up so far down the list [Music] Weezer's latest record at the recording of this video there 20 19 album black and it's essentially one of the biggest whatever's the group has ever recorded point-blank period certainly not the worst album they've ever put out but a totally forgettable mixed bag that really has no defining characteristics about it whatsoever despite the kind of bold direction the band took on the cover art here I was excited for this album originally especially given teasers like can't knock the hustle which felt like a nice 90s throwback to a hodgepodge of rock and pop and hip hop packaged into a really sharp song that reflects Weezer's creative trajectory over the years but despite a promising first half this album essentially just turns into make-believe part 2 with the band dishing out another helping of the most soulless pop rock imaginable tracked so cleanly that the instrumentals on this thing just sound like music from feel-good beer commercials not to mention some of the band's worst songs ever turn up on this record - like the prince who wanted everything whose lyrics I really just can't stand also the band's totally out of left field attempt at writing like some Island pop on a Byzantine this thing is mostly just a forgettable dud from a band who really could be taking more risks at this point in their career at least when they were doing things like this on make-believe there was like an audience and a radio market for exactly this at this point what or who an album like black serves I'm just not sure the next album in my list here also came out in 2019 it is Weezer's fifth self-titled album the teal one I would say this point in the Weezer worse to best is where the album's start getting tolerable in fact I would say most of the tracks on this album are pretty enjoyable despite this album not containing any original songs and not a whole lot of creative liberties outside of filtering these tracks through their usual Weezer sound that kind of heavy chunky nerdy power pop inspired alternative rock sound there are some tracks on this thing where the band lays on the attitude or the fun really thick like on their stadium-sized version of happy together or their take on TLC's no scrubs but for the most part Weezer's takes on these tracks are kind of unimaginative still though even that works out most of the time because their performances and the recordings on these tracks are pretty great especially on their version of Africa especially on their version of take on me and I guess I do appreciate the band's attempt at drifting away from some of the more obvious rock choices that I think a lot of bands would have made if they were doing a cover album themselves as Weezer's choices tend to focus more around synth pop and pop in general on most of the tracks here rivers deliver some quality vocal performances but the quality of those and this album in general does tend to falter in the second half like his attempt at singing Michael Jackson's Billie Jean is is laughable to put it nicely nor is Bryan Bell's attempt at singing an old-school Black Sabbath song that gray either also the instrumental progression of the Bands attempt at playing the song stand by me is is utter trash as they have no appreciation whatsoever for the instrumental subtlety of that song this thing is sweet its listenable if you're a hardcore fan you most likely should give it at least a try and honestly it's just funny that this covers album beats out quality-wise a good chunk of Weezer's discography next in our worst to best we have Weezer's 2008 record red which is why we written off by many fans of the band or ignored maybe because it's coming out of an era where Weezer wasn't at their best no matter the quality every album Weezer does these days does seem to suffer from some kind of original sin that I guess they haven't quite answered for yet but as someone who just enjoys the band's knack for nerdy ear worm pop rock red does deliver some decent tracks it's a flawed album for sure but it's certainly not Weezer trying to be something that they're not and the sound of this album wasn't totally lacking in bite like make-believe was still there are more moments on this thing that make me go yikes than I would like like the band's decision to have Brian Bell write and sing a song on here the track thought I knew which is easily one of the worst tracks Weezer has ever recorded it sounds like an awful boring run-of-the-mill 90s alternative rock single that would have been dead on arrival at the desk of any radio programmer at the time then the band goes full beatles and lets the drummer sing one yes Patrick Wilson has his own track on here the track automatic which is kind of a hard rocking but still completely substance list pop rock tune with her if eclis awkward chorus hey it's automatic lyrically rivers also runs a master class on cringe on the track cold dark world but I see the girl that you are deep inside won't you allow me to give you a ride I can console you and give you a kiss show you that you can do better than this I wish I was making these lyrics up but I'm not the band continues to lay on the melodrama on the track the angel in the one but this song as well as dream ins see the band overextending the length of their tracks past the point to where they're even entertaining now I could see why some fans recoiled at the sound of tracks like everybody get dangerous everybody get dangerous but if Weezer taking themselves seriously isn't a requirement for you to enjoy a Weezer song then you should have no problem getting into this track I also have heavy respect on this record for the track the greatest man who ever with its multiple musical and instrumental changes it's one of the most ambitious things the band has ever recorded it's kind of like their happiness is a warm gun the opening track on this thing is really good heart songs is easily one of the band's best ballads and honestly pork and beans will forever remain one of my favorite Weezer singles period and not just because of its incredible riffs and it's thick production and its really sharp songwriting and I do like the ethos of the track stating the band's creative freedom and that they're gonna do what they want to do taking a shot at haters and critics who are trying to push the band into being the group they want them to be when that's just not gonna happen and yes that is a theme that is an idea that the band has touched down on in song many many many times at this point but pork and beans is maybe one of my favorite examples of it I guess certainly not the worst album in their discography obviously in my opinion but a record still where I think I appreciate what they're trying to do more than what they actually did and read does feature some of the best musical highlights from Weezer of this decade as well as some excruciating tracks as well that's why it's falling kind of in the middle of this list [Music] honestly despite its dumb cover silly name and extremely flaccid promotional rollout Hurley is a pretty good album for Weezer I liked it upon release and in retrospect I see this album as being a part of a miniature streak where the band was kind of getting the ball rolling once again on putting out less sucky album kind of a miniature return to form from here to the White Album and this thing is just a bunch of no-frills pop rock songs that see the band just kind of getting back to basics while also inviting on a lot of guest songwriters people who have a track record for making hits individuals like Mac Davis and Linda Perry and I would say this album is the first instance where Weezer inviting on these other songwriters to help make the record really paid off the quality really showed in how good the Tunes were you have the exuberant and celebratory memories which is an amazing opener memories make me wanna go back there back there the amazing song ruling me which is this track about being essentially a slave to desire and lust the driving guitars the harmonious background vocals and the undeniable chorus on this thing are great you also have the dysfunctional and heart-wrenching train wrecks even rivers only solo songwriting outing on this thing unspoken is incredible it feels like a youthful raw acoustic throwback to the days of Pinkerton in a way if only this track could have been recorded in a more low Fife action it would have fit right in on that album yes there is nothing truly new or exciting for Weezer on this record but when it comes to either putting out an album that isn't total trash that's excitement enough for me with one catchy and rocking and passionate and well produced track after another on this record I can't not walk away from Hurley pleased there are a few goofy moments in the tracklist like smart girls as well as where's my sex which sounds like a weird warped demented take on 90s grunge but honestly even though these tracks are my favorites they do add to the personality of the album and do prevent it from being totally one-dimensional unfortunately I think Hurley will continue to be looked at as more footnote in the band's discography than an admirable moment but this will forever remain one of the group's more solid records in my opinion and will also serve as a reminder that album covers matter please pick a good album cover you know like try just try the next installment in our worst to best is Weezer's 2001 record green which came after a pretty long stint of studio album silence after their 96 record Pinkerton liked their first LP it was produced by the cars Ric Ocasek and it was clocking in at just over 28 minutes yes back in 2001 Weezer was already on that short album wave this thing was also Weezer's most poppy and polished record at the time too obviously the blue album had its share of big singles but green with one track after the next you can tell the band was really trying to deliver here a lot of very throttling and catchy pop punk and alt rock just go really simple and meat-and-potatoes with it don't get too tied up into difficult emotions and sadness like they were on Pinkerton much of the songwriting on this thing is rooted in a pretty bold catchy vocal melody or a crunchy guitar riff like on maybe the biggest single from this thing hash pipe Jun Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin Jin and the band's more impersonal approach to songwriting and lyricism did seem to pay off as Green did kind of kill it on the charts of course the popularity of this album was bolstered by Weezer returning with some huge singles like Island in the Sun and hash pipe that I mentioned earlier which believe it or not is actually one of my least favorite Weezer songs to this day I just think the lyrics of that track are so dumb but overall in this album the band did do a decent job of streamlining and simplifying their sound for a more pop centric audience there are some tracks on here that I think are instantly enjoyable maybe even a little addictive and even the more mediocre tracks on this record they don't go too deep into the weeds they don't overstay their welcome given the brevity of green overall and even if this album sketchiest does any of it really as good as Buddy Holly not really so then [Music] despite its initially lukewarm reception Weezer's 2002 record maladroit has actually gained a bit of a cult following amongst the band's fanbase even though rivers on this album wasn't penning songs that were as personal or as revealing as the tracks on Pinkerton maladroit is a bit of a return to that heavier nastier edgier sound the band forged on that record the unsurpassed heaviness from Weezer on this record is enough to place it higher than green in this ranking and the fact that this record was so successful with its placement in the charts that sort of showed that Weezer didn't necessarily need to tone down their sound to see success unfortunately not every bad habit is broken on maladroit one of the lead singles dopes knows is just as hard to stomach and just as vapid lyrically as hash pipe and just like on green there are a handful of tracks on here that are pretty forgettable and breezy the heavier production and guitars can really only do so much to mask that still though there are some great highlights like the crushing opening track the seemingly post-rock inspired death obstruction even though mallet Rory is not a super substantive record from Weezer and a lot of the tracks on this thing really delivered just simply an instantaneous thrill this is definitely a small return to form from the band at this point in their career and unfortunately they didn't continue to improve on or work with this sound on to their next record make believe maybe maladroit would be looked on more positively in retrospect if the band had sort of built up the momentum they created here [Music] the next release in this Weezer worst to best is their 2014 record everything will be alright in the end which in my opinion is a really enjoyable bounce back from a few of the most disliked albums in the band's discography hurley and r attitude as i said earlier in this video to me hurley was the band kind of going back to basics embracing what put them on the map in the first place just dishing out good pop rock songs and everything will be alright in the end is just another helping of that the chunky guitars the youthful energy the very hooky choruses they're all here on this record Weezer essentially sounding like their old selves on an amazing opener ain't got nobody plus it's interesting to hear the band go down memory lane at a point in their career where they can kind of recall their career before this point like on the track back to the shack keep in mind at this point in the Bands career this is kind of a recurring theme that they've been touching down on one album after another on Hurley they were just talking about it on memories take me back back to the shack back to the strap with the lightning strap kicking the door more hardcore rocking out like it's 94 this track is like an amazing anthemic demand for Weezer to retake the mantle that they once held and simultaneously on this record there is acknowledgement that things have changed and are most likely not going back to the way that they used to be on eulogy for a rock band personally I think Weezer really in their element on this album they're not laying the sugar on too heavy they're not desperate to appeal to a crowd of people who never really messed with their music in the first place they're also dishing out some of their best and most unique songwriting in years Cleopatra whose hook has a really strange groove to it there's also da Vinci with its quirky acoustic guitar leads and quaint whistles also the hook on this thing is fantastic DaVinci good easily some of the cutest lyrics that have ever been laid down on a Weezer record there's also some surprising ambition on this record to like be queen inspired vocal harmonies on I've had it up to here and the closing future scape trilogy is one of the oddest things that Weezer has ever put on any of their records it's like a miniature rock opera at the very end of this album this album that I think overall is a very solid record features some good guest songwriting great product and Weezer just doing what they do best [Music] next in my worst to best list here is Weezer's 2016 White Album which yes is one of the Bands more recent releases but I actually think is is one of their best I think it's the closest they've come to rekindling the pop prowess of blue but with some more anthemic ambitions throw it into the mix and the many faces of Weezer that we know all too well up until this point are looking pretty crisp on this album you have sweet and sunny tracks like the opening California kids or windowsill you also cannot forget the heavily Beach Boys inspired girl we got a good thing probably one of the brightest and most unabashedly lovey-dovey songs that Weezer has ever recorded and it's actually pretty great as they achieve this vibe without having to cross over entirely into a super sterile super squeaky clean territory there are moments on this thing that are angsty and dark and utterly obsessed with the opposite sex like thank God for girls Rivers also gets personal and kind of on a power trip on king of the world where he imagines himself as being in a position where he can just basically protect his significant other from any kind of sadness from having to shed a tear despite the state of the world and despite the trauma that she suffered as a kid we also see Rivers trapped in kind of a weird Peter Pan state delivering a good song but still feeling the audacity to tell LA girls to act their age even though he at this point in the band's career is a man who's close to pushing 50 the album ends off with a few quality low-key cuts the forlorn jacked-up as well as the acoustic Beach rock number endless bummer this album is certainly not Weezer's most lyrically dense or substantive unfortunately the band's first two records are going to forever sit in that position but as far as albums go that are in this post Pinkerton era where the band is more focused on straightforward pop rock this is definitely a high point [Music] Pinkerton Weezer's 1996 album is the next release in this list as we get closer and closer to the best spot and it is often regarded by hardcore fans to be Weezer's magnum opus nowadays that is but when it initially dropped this record was met with mixed reviews pretty widespread dislike amongst audiences and even unhappy fans it was considered a commercial disappointment I think there were multiple factors playing into this one of which may have been the band's decision to produce the album themselves it did come out kind of rough as a result certainly not as clean or as catchy or as straightforward as blue even in blues most difficult moments and you have to keep in mind the band's success after that record was overnight and where you go after overnight success when your discography is is so short it can be difficult going far left so suddenly may not necessarily pay off instantly and a drop in recording quality could mean everything especially given blue was pretty pristine for the time that it was released Pinkertons mix was decidedly way more abrasive as evidenced by tracks like tired of sex the blaring feedback the vocals the guitars the drums are all hot as hell but still grunge and various forms of metal had already introduced a lot of these sounds into the mainstream really it was rivers TMI lyrics that were turning a lot of fans off the record is pretty sad it is pretty dark it is sex-obsessed also features a track that finds rivers fetishizing a letter written to him by like an 18 year old japanese fan so how exactly did this album go from total dud to perceived masterpiece I'm not entirely sure maybe these days were just more open to hearing emo Harvard boys whine about the trials and tribulations of being a rock star as well as wanting to get laid or not wanting to get laid or whatever because honestly there are moments on this album where the lyrics aren't really any less cringy than they were when it was originally released but I guess there is something scorchingly honest about the way that rivers sings about what he does on this record so I guess if you're looking for an album that analyzes maybe in an unhealthy way but still analyzes male sexual desires in current culture this is certainly it all the songs hit pretty hard they each have very intense performances and despite all the messiness and emotional insanity on this thing the songwriting is is still pretty solid the progressions are relatively straightforward the hooks catch pretty hard Pinkerton may be a flawed album but it's a record that where's those flaws has kind of a badge of honor because cringe-worthy confessionalism and all Pinkerton deserves its recognition as an emo and a power pop masterpiece okay and here we are at the best spot in the Weezer discography list and and that is blue if you've been watching my reviews for years and you have seen my video talking about how I like blue more than Pinkerton you may have seen this coming but yeah blue is amazing and in my opinion is easily one of the best alternative rock and power pop records of the 90s thanks to the grungy and kind of punchy production rivers boyish but very well executed lead vocals the amazing and sweet and anthemic guitar soloing and the band's generally perfect bittersweet sound and style I know a lot of us like to look at and argue over Weezer now versus Weezer then but honestly on this very album in the tracklist we see a lot of the same ideas sounds and themes being explored that Weezer has been kind of recycling throughout much of their career truth be told the band has not changed that much we have rivers looking back on his past that brought him to this point before he even really had a career in music to look back on before he was going back to the shack he was in the garage we have the band in rivers showing their love of West Coast and Beach culture to the point of pure absurdity on surf wax America we have rivers difficulties tangling with relationships even if they are familial or platonic ones on Sadie and so and rivers is also carefree and playful and in love on Buddy Holly and of course having a hard time functioning when it comes to romance and women as evidenced by the incredibly catchy but also disturbingly controlling no one else even the band's love of taking ideas vintage pop songs and filtering them in a somewhat corny fashion through this heavy grungy alt-rock lens was well-established on holiday truly the most tumultuous thing about Weezer's progression past this point in their discography is just the drop in quality of their songwriting and just kind of neutering their sound sadly the band is never going to come up with a better songwriting metaphor than what they did on undone the sweater song but to be fair very few 90s bands did and it does sound cliche at this point I know to say something like we Weezer's early stuff is their best their first album is the best but Weezer is part of the reason that cliche exists Weezer is the ultimate they used to be good band which is partially reality yes but also kind of an optical illusion for anybody who's actually willing to give anything they put out post Pinkerton a fair shake not to say the band didn't reach some point of perfection on this album because they did but rivers Cuomo's honesty his vulnerability his authenticity that he showed on this record it could have only continued to exist in obscurity in a bubble which is especially true when you consider the way that he reacted to the band's sudden popularity on Pinkerton the way that he then reacted to Pinkertons lack of success on the band's subsequent records and now with every new album there seems to be at least one track where he is reflecting on you guys are telling us what you want us to do but we want to do what we want to do if you could use Weezer as a prime example for anything it's it's definitely how Fame and attention and the music industry can destroy or even poison the creative process because as soon as you throw somebody into the spotlight the last thing you're going to get from them is authenticity and it's even funnier to think how performative it is for other artists out there to try to recreate that same sense of authenticity off of a Weezer or like a Nirvana album but that was kind of the shape of rock to come in the 2000s as all of the emo and indie acts that hit the mainstream during that era were far more interested in relating than they were rocking out which is not inherently a bad thing but I still do think it comes from a weird place to see this sea change of rock stars out there that aren't really trying to sell fans on these grand shows of excess and stardom and are instead trying to offer listeners more of like this display of emotional credibility so if there's truthfully anything that Weezer's early work has that there later works don't it's it's that and it's something that unfortunately is never really going to return especially since that Weezer continues to be one of the biggest rock acts out there today and as somebody who's enjoyed Weezer's music for a long time I don't think this popularity shift for the band from 94 to 2000 was a complete loss certainly at this point there's nothing stopping the band from writing another my name is Jonas but they most likely never will put out another only in dreams not just thematically speaking but also given how patient and raw the sound of that track is to I know I'm talking about blue at this point more in context of everything else and even rock music at large then about the album itself but make no mistake I do think this record is fantastic the production's amazing the flow of this record is fantastic to the songwriting is top-notch super catchy super enjoyable the singing is really passionate every track and the track list is pretty substantive and comes through with a very focused topic overall just amazing album and really happy to put it at the top of my worst best list here and that that has been the Weezer worst to best feel Mike I got a weight off my shoulders now so so yeah transition have you given these albums a listen and how would you rank them let me know I want to give a quick shout out to Austin for helping me co-write this episode of worse to best over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana music Weezer worse to best but forever

XrNB3eSiTmg,ha hi everyone Ecch that a sight tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new map most record plastic anniversary formed in 1994 the musical duo known as Matt mos has always consisted of drew Daniel and Martin Schmidt and while not always appreciated for it the duo over the years has built up one of the weirdest and most eclectic discographies in electronic music between collaborations with people like us as well as so percussion strange concept albums that do things like try to find the common ground between American and medieval folk music sampling various kinds of surgery also their last full-length album over here which I loved which sampled a washing machine specifically their washing machine as well as also not sampling anything at all like the entirely synthesized supreme balloon Matt Moses discography covers a pretty wide range of left-field vases from IDM and Glitch plunder phonics sound collage full chronica music concrete but if you could a duo sound to anything it's they're incredibly unique approach to sampling and sound manipulation and pairing almost each album of theirs up with a pretty interesting concept and plastic anniversary is no exception to that rule essentially this album revolves around the very heavy sampling of plastics plastic it is all around us it saves lives it fills our oceans it's destroying our environment and it's literally a part of every step of the process of me getting my reviews done too so why not make an album based around it as well now like usual with Matt Mo's some of the source material for the samples on these tracks is pretty obvious they even go as far as to hint toward it in the titles like the persistent sounds of billiard balls clacking together on the track billiard balls and synthetic fat the sharp plastic snack of those billiard balls on this track provides for some very sharp and prickly percussive bits as the duo essentially progresses on this track through a very strange and mysterious piece of IDM then there's also thermoplastic riot shield whose percussive sections sound like they are lifted from the sound of smacking a thermoplastic riot shield and then there are instances of sampling on this record that are less obvious like on the opening track breaking bread which according to a Thrill Jockey press release I saw actually consists of of the sound of breaking records specifically from the band bread so breaking records by a band named bread breaking bread which is honestly the most novel way of sampling a record I think I've heard in a long time I could list off every weird sampling idea implemented throughout this album but honestly Matt Moses importance is based less on that and more on their ability to manipulate these sounds into actually compelling and enjoyable musical compositions again to go back to the opening track breaking bread it is a fun and thrilling and funky opener loaded with these squeaky and grunty bits of rhythm and bass even though it's a relatively short track it's still packed with quite a few shifts and segues and passages sounds like the most danceable thing that you could potentially get out of like an experimental chemical lab where you lock a bunch of mad scientist's in it and this is essentially what they concoct the song the crying pill is interestingly titled considering that it is packed with these descending wailing tones that sound like just blood dripping down a wall in the middle of like a horror movie trailer the eerie tension of this track is built up even further with these orchestral sized hits of percussion also some really bold arpeggios - this is maybe one of the most cinematic tracks of the entire record and oddly enough the chemically synthesized silicone gel implant has some melodic and rhythmic grooves that kind of remind me of bits from the duo supreme balloon album which is not necessarily a bad thing given that is one of my favorite map most records period and also even if there's a touch of compositional overlap between this track in that record this song does have a pretty different sound palette much more prickly and plucky essentially sounding like the duo is trying to soundtrack the hustle and bustle of a microscopic city or a colony of ants going about doing what they do the classical influences on this record fade back in on the title track sounds like some really beautiful triumphant horn sections colored with the sputter alien wails and tones and quick bits of percussion just a very strange sound palette organized for a very uplifting purpose we get a pretty nice contrast on the next track thermoplastic riot shield which has these heavy crushing almost industrial hits of percussion and noise definitely one of the wildest things that Matt Mo's have ever delivered in their entire discography meanwhile there's kind of a shift in tone on fanfare for polyethylene waste containers and collapse of the fourth Kingdom where both have this very rhythmic and primal quality to them almost like I'm listening to a drum circle or a drum line it's like the flow the album is bringing us to a point where we've reached the death of society and now we're suffering through a plastic dystopia which has brought us back to a state of tribalism or something and the album gets even more rudimentary and I guess primordial on the closing track plasti spear which is essentially a sound collage and an ambient piece where all these plastic samples are culminated to create the sound of like a beach the waves wishing the wind blowing Birds calling it sounds like that but it's not that because it's it sounds like instead of birds you're hearing like plastic squeaks maybe you're hearing like plastic bags rustling instead of the water but it's all been heavily manipulated to the point where it sounds eerily similar to the seashore like it's instantly recognizable if you're not listening closely enough you might just think it's the sound of the ocean it is the sound of nature being recreated with something very unnatural all of it being filtered through this really cool complete and thoughtful concept that the duo has created now there were a few tracks that I found to be a little underwhelming or maybe the flow wasn't quite as seamless or as on the edge of my seat as I would have hoped for example the song singing tube was maybe not the most novel in the bunch in my opinion Matt MOS are certainly not the first artists out there to create a singing tube of some sort and I'm not sure if their application of it on this album is the most novel that I've ever heard though I do like the way they've kind of manipulated it to almost sound like a guitar at some point so guitar being strummed still though thought this was a great album and I absolutely loved it really intriguing unique fun and totally weird and it's absolutely amazing that Matt Mo's have been able to keep their creative energies up and keep them cutting edge so far into their career I'm feeling a decent to a strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana matt most plastic anniversary forever 
bm5pY9D8kK8,hi everyone oxen egon tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Dave Record psychodrama this is the debut full-length commercial album of Dave or Santana Dave he is from Streatham and has been building up the hype on this new record of his with a couple of eps a handful of singles as well he is a guy who in his music is not afraid to address a lot of social and political issues in fact that is kind of what has defined his work up until this point especially with breakthrough tracks like question time a track addressing war and inequality as well as economic struggles and British politics and given that this song is a pretty good track touching down on a lot of must address issues I went into this new album expecting something pretty thoughtful maybe a little dramatic as well something trying to get to the heart of societal ills today and that is definitely what psychodrama is or at least attempting to be but honestly after numerous listens to this album I can't say that it's it's really resonating with me despite me nodding in agreement with much of what Dave is saying on this record for one the instrumentals on this thing are absolutely generic all of the glistening and super synthetic pianos and swells all over this record the beats on this album really have nothing novel or colourful about them there's a bit of added atmosphere to a lot of the beats on this thing for a bit of theatrics but much of the time the production isn't really evoke eveni thing for me the beats on this thing read kind of like instrumentals that you would find strewn about YouTube that some hardcore Eminem are Hopsin Stan would be kind of downloading off of the website to spit some really introspective meaningful shit over the instrumentals just had this really cloying overly sentimental quality about them that is an absolute turnoff occasionally throwing out completely unnecessary fluff like the piano solo at the very end of screwface capital and all the super pristine harps and strings on Leslie I really cannot and that vocal at the end of the track you can not tell me that that voice isn't basically something that you would usually hear on like a Machine Gun Kelly record and again all of this despite me liking a lot of what Dave is saying especially the incredibly heart-wrenching story at the core of that song Leslie the girl in that song her toxic relationship her baby the tragic finish of that song is awe-inspiring its eye widening it is stomach-churning really makes you reflect on our sad reality and the unfortunate positions that a lot of people are put in especially women who are in abusive relationships as this track reflects on not only do I find the instrumentals lacking but also day's delivery leaves a lot to be desired a lot of the time he's rapping with this subdued middle-of-the-road kind of choked up delivery that runs more like spoken word than it does rapping which I'm not necessarily against rappers who who tend to fall on that side of the fence there are quite a few who deliver in a more spoken word style that I think is pretty great however I don't find Dave's particular approach to that all that compelling there's quite a bit of emotional substance to what he's saying in his tracks but when it comes to his delivery it feels kind of emotionally flat and listen message and substance in your music is great it's often what is the most lacking when it comes to the most popular artists out there today but as a rapper what you're saying can be just as important as how you are saying it that's the other side of the coin and when it comes to Dave in that particular instance much of what he's saying on this record may be sensible oftentimes accurate but still he comes off incredibly cliche in his wording in his descriptions in the philosophical points that he tries to pull out of his songs and stories too much of what I'm hearing here is so on the nose it's less like I'm listening to a song and more like I'm listening to I don't know like a blog post or an advice column or like an inspirational macro that somebody age ranged 30 to 50 posted on pay and again I'm in agreement with most of what Dave is saying on this record if it were posted on Twitter or something somewhere I'd probably either like it respond or retweet it but there's something about the plain instrumentals and completely humdrum flows and his very average voice that is preventing the points he's trying to get across from really translating to a captivating song I appreciate a lot of the personal themes on this record I kind of admired what he was trying to do with the whole overarching therapy thing as he's kind of having his therapists respond to the things that he's saying in these tracks segwang from one moment to the next on the record I think there are a lot of good qualities about this record I can see why people are so excited about it I can see why I've gotten so many demands to review it but personally I'm incredibly indifferent toward Dave's execution on this album or rather I think it really kind of rained on my potential parade for this album I'm feeling a light to decent five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out and I'll see you in the next one Anthony

supports the channel supports the segment alright and also want to shout out hot dad the the dude hot daddy has a new project out the chowder man which believe me is coming with a whole bunch of other multimedia to sort of explain the background and the origin of the chowder man just you wait hot dad is essentially the Internet weirdos David Bowie at this point dude is reinventing himself okay he's becoming he is embodying the chowder man on this new record also from what I understand there's an insane guitar solo from none other than Andrew W K on it give it a shot give it a try it is linked down below along with everything else that we're gonna be talking about in this segment so that's a that's a shout out there shout out to a to the dude hot dad alright were the worst tracks of the week the tracks that I thought were the worst that ones that kind of turned me off a little bit let's do it let's go first off LSD labyrinth SIA and Diplo are continuing their very lengthy collaboration it seems like these guys have been dropping track here and there for quite a long time at this point their new record is finally coming out pretty soon and I don't know I've kind of had a range so far on these new tracks there have been songs from this collaborative that I have really enjoyed there have been others like this one that I think just serve as really bland unimaginative millennial pop hopefully there is a lot less of that and in few tracks that I've heard of that so far from this collaborative you know are overshadowed by the better moments on this record because when these three are on I do think they actually come up with some pretty creative pop tunes so actually kind of looking forward to the record that they're coming out with very soon thought it was actually gonna drop at some point last year but looks like 2019 is gonna be the year for LSD all right also Iggy Azalea has a new track out titled Sally Walker I already didn't care for this track all that much when it was the cardi B song money because that's exactly what this track sounds like it sounds exactly like the cardi B song money but less entertaining with less personality and look I mean even though I'm not that crazy about that cardi B track I will take that song over this blatant ripoff any day of the week so yeah this track is just basically a ripoff of a cardi B's money all right moving on from there Grimes has come out with a new demo for the track pretty dark and I'm not really into that demo I mean Grimes has come out with demo tracks before that I didn't really like and maybe it was mostly because of the rough recording but while I think the tune of this track is cute the the weird nasally obnoxious baby boat baby vocals that she provides on this track really did kind of get to me and not in a good way so hopefully whatever finished or more polished version there is of this song coming down the pipe in the future it's it's better than what she served up here and maybe features less less baby singing moving out from there black bear has a brand new track I swear to God liking that this guy isn't even really trying to feign the whole alternative R&B thing anymore and is just like coming out with really bad pop music so uh yeah I don't even get why he continues to put up this front where like his art and what he's doing is like darker edgy in any kind of way because this weird string back ballad is just like painfully generic and cloying moving on from there let's get into the tracks that I thought were kind of meh not blowing me away but hey worth worth your attention worth a shot worth a mention let's get through these teairra whack has a brand new track out I thought the vocals on it were a tad bit awkward but teaira wack is always putting out something that was pretty interesting on the the weirdo spectrums so looking forward to hearing more material from her always and still generally pretty happy that she is getting a little bit more ambitious with her song lengths and she is staying prolific and staying engaged and can't wait for the new record can't wait then for the new record when exactly that ever is coming out I'm moving on from their schoolboy q nom nom Juice brand new single music video out did a full-length review of this track on the Fantana channel I think the beat hits pretty hard I think some of Q's lyrics are pretty grimy I wish it had a bit more girth a bit more length to it that it had a bit more structure as a song but it's got a nice mean attitude and I guess that is enough to have me intrigued about this new record I am definitely not worried that is this gonna be an angry and a grimy and a badass album most likely but hopefully the oncoming tracks on this new album are a bit more ambitious than this one even if this thing does you know come out very mean and like I said has a nice attitude to it moving on from there there's a brand new record coming out from the Preservation Hall Jazz Band believe it or not they actually are dropping a record via Sub Pop Records which is quite a nice surprise and if you guys remember my review of their last album I believe it was they went into kind of a surprising Latin jazz direction on that record and it would seem they're actually kind of maintaining that direction on this new album and taking it down to Cuba although in in my assessment I do think that this track as far as the solos and the performance goes that's a little mild you know not too spicy not too exciting or anything like that very much driving the speed limit I guess I'll say to describe the performance here but still as far as like some very sweet tune full rich Latin jazz goes it's it's pretty it's pretty enjoyable it's pretty enjoyable alright moving on from there we actually have a brand new track from king gizzard in the lizard wizard fishing for fishies it's a very cute weird ballad that honestly wasn't doing a whole lot for me I thought that some parts of it were so weird and corny that I was a little turned off by it yeah I don't know man I don't know man that their their recent output his you know surprised me blow me away but also made me cringe a little bit so either way I know they're gonna be doing something freaky and unexpected on this new record so I'm psyched I'm sure there are a lot of people out here loving this song though Karen oh and Danger Mouse have a new record together I have been saying it new song out turn the light it is a pretty sweet low-key ballad the production and the vocals I found to be a little average and bland for the both of them but it's still a pretty nice and sweet track Jenny Lewis has a new track out new record on the way this one is a little shimmery tear in your beer sadness a vague kind of country aesthetic to it but it doesn't go so far to the point where it's backwater or anything like that you know it's it's a like I said very shimmery and sad and and moody and nostalgic quite a bit of nostalgia coming out of the lyrics which I like quite a bit the performance is a little by the numbers and and stiff but it's still a decent ballad moving on from there an artist to before today I wasn't really all that familiar with Gavin Turek has this new track out titled elevator and for a song that is um so washed out in reverb the songwriting detail is actually quite nice on this track so if you do like your pop music to be very shimmering and sweet and a little cavernous but have still like some decent vocals on it and a lot of thought put towards some of the melodies woven into it give it a shot give it a shot and beast coast which encompasses all of those artists coming out of New York that you already know for working under this label as as a very loose collective your Flatbush zombies and your underachievers and your pro era and so on and so forth they are now releasing music under the Beast Coast name left-hand is the name of this big introductory single considering how many people are encompassed into this beast Coast thing obviously everybody is not on this one track but it's still a kind of eerie nocturnal banger with some good flows and in a mean bangin beat so if you do love you know Flatbush zombies and all those guys affiliated with the beast coast name and label do be psyched for what they are gonna be delivering very soon under this title moving on from there we have a brand new track from Baroness borderlines new video out and yeah I mean I'm not super duper crazy about it frankly I feel like this track sounds like a somewhat neutered a little more acoustic and spacious version of a track that could have landed on purple honestly it's it's it's really like another purple song its melodic its triumphant it's got a strong ballad quality to it but I feel like the intensity and and really uh I don't know that I guess the more metal aspects of the Bands sound has been toned down a little bit on this track not that I'd mind that entirely because I do like there are a lot of metal groups out there groups affiliated with that genre that are kind of getting back to the basics of melody and songwriting and maybe drifting away from the extremity a little bit because I do think that only gets you so far however I do think that the the the band's shift this time around hasn't really brought that much in terms of like just a novel or a refreshing idea as again it sort of sounds like a track that could have slipped very cleanly into purple except with this slightly less heavy sound and and not that I mind more acoustic music or anything like that but I don't think the production on this is is all that great you know the guitars just sound kind of flat and lifeless and yeah it just feels like it's it's lacking some kind of color so we'll we'll leave it there I guess and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best this week the ones that resonated with me the most Wow me the most want to give a shout out to this SG Lewis and Clio track throw away which is actually a pretty sweet blend of better and pop and alternative R&B the vocals and the production are kind of bare but it's got a really sweet tune to it The Ballad the song at the core of it is actually really solid so enjoying it so far next brand-new track from legendary death metal outfit possessed you should be familiar with these guys if you watched my death metal starter pack because I very much recommended their debut album in that starter pack not only because it is an amazing death metal album but these guys are a pretty key band when it comes to the most formative years of the death metal genre so given that even though this new song over here is very well written it is throttling it is blood pumping the band still maintains their relatively old school sound even with them having such a short discography and such a long gap of time in between each album in their discography the sound they bring to the table here you know it's it's like a lot of early death metal records features some thrash elements coming out of the guitars so there there are other metal Styles influencing very clearly what they're doing where they're you know they're not a tech death band they're not um you know this kind of band that's like got sort of the crazy guttural more new-school death metal vocals or anything like that though the vocal performance on this track is incredible get into this track get into this track you know if you're unfamiliar with old school death metal and the usual generic death metal tropes kind of turn you off you may want to give it a listen to something like this instead throws it back a little bit further and I guess has some more I guess more traditional and tried-and-true songwriting elements to it as opposed to the main vein of extremity that has dominated the a great deal of death metal for a long time moving on from there we have this new track over here from a group that I'm just now becoming familiar with a martyr Dodd cashless society is the name of this new track and this is coming off of Southern Lord Records and this is well it has some pretty strong thrash elements running throughout it and some incredibly ferocious lead vocals as well that I'm absolutely loving there's definitely some elements of beep D beat and hardcore punk and crust punk rolling throughout this thing but given that it is Southern Lord there is this really ominous mountainous heaviness to it and dark atmosphere to it that is actually pretty great and refreshing for this style of loud rock moving on from there we have a brand new track a brand new collaborative track from Marissa Nadler and Stephen Brodsky whoo that's interesting these two are crossing paths Marissa and Adler you may know her as a singer-songwriter that I've covered on the channel numerous times Stephen is actually from the band caved in and also mute eyed man and what they've come through with here is like a very dark dreary ballad like you would typically catch from Marissa Nadler with those ghostly vocals and everything but it's all backed with these super heavy roaring chunky and sometimes wailing guitar layers now like you know no crazy drums or anything like that it's just kind of like matching Marissa's voice with these heavy distorted but also somewhat droney guitars too so I guess it is titled drone flower the name of this new project that they have coming on the way for the Sun is the name of the particular track that they have delivered here and I don't know I guess just color me entertained and intrigued so looking forward to hearing what these two are going to be doing on this new record moving on from the air Kieran Jake Allen an Australian music Titan meme master has a brand new song out the hole of the moon it is kind of a throwback 80s rock ballad with some great lyrics and vocal melodies I absolutely love it looking forward what this guy's gonna be doing on the next record absolutely all right moving on from there Holly Herndon has come through with a brand new track as well shout out to her eternal is the name of this song and it's actually a pretty hard-hitting and very percussive piece of art pop with some incredibly weird vocal manipulations running throughout it there are some elements of it that I think are a bit Bjork ish but some of the weird production tricks and strange freaky again I'll use the word manipulations that she pulls throughout this track definitely define her as an artist you know all her own which very much was her mo on her previous work which was a lot more electronic a lot glitchy er nice to see her working in in more of an art pop realm I guess and giving that a shot and seeing some really good results with this new track over here if I didn't already say it eternally I did so ternal is the name of that cut moving on from there Frankie cosmos a singer-songwriter who previously I've never been super crazy about frankly and that's not to say that I thought her previous stuff was bad really it's always been a be a tad bit underwhelming to me and maybe leaning a bit too hard on this um underachiever type of you know bedroom indie pop where I guess sort of like how under produced or under written or under everything it is like a part of the appeal which again I sort of you know get where that stuff is coming from but as far as that style goes a lot of her stuff has never really stood out to me all that much but this is a track over here which is a pretty straightforward and stripped back piano ballad definitely did hit me hit me right in the fields and I guess looking forward to this new record that she has coming out very soon maybe this is gonna be the year where Frankie cosmos gets a little ambitious because even though her stuff in the past has been kind of low fie this new track despite how stripped back it was it did sound pretty cleanly recorded so you know I guess I guess we'll see looking forward again to to seeing what she's gonna be doing dancing is the name of this new track and it's also linked to a you know kind of a b-side too so give that a listen as well it's also pretty good alright moving on from there and it's Spira mental rap artist from tokyo death bomb arc actually has a new record on the way that they have been hyping up this new track which I would love to point to your attention in 20xx the artist is named dos Manos or Manos and yeah it's actually got like a really crazy old-school hip-hop be kind of to it like if if you told me this was a RZA beat but then some demented person sort of went in there and through a bunch of weird glitchy sour sounds into it then yeah I guess I would probably have to believe you does kind of sound like an old wu-tang beat but again with some weird freaky additions and I I do like the dudes flow and his delivery and his personality even if there is a bit of a language barrier there it's it's actually kind of strange and I'm looking forward to hearing what this guy is going to be doing with this new record because this little taste so far is really bold and it is really really out there moving on from there we have our Kade fire who have a cover of the song baby mine out now which is obviously set to be on the dumbo soundtrack it's cute it's sweet it's fine I like it and also Anderson Pak Anderson Pak King James is the name of this new track he has a new record on the way very soon sort of rumored to be shift in his style more toward a soul sound and I mean if you're familiar with Anderson's past material this doesn't sound really unlike much of that but with better production this time around I actually like in some of the beats on this thing to what he was doing with knowledge on you know that that collaborative he did with him a little while ago yes Lord I did a full length review of this track on the Fantana channel check that out if you want but in short I like the song quite a bit productions great anderson vocals are great the tune is there pretty much everything I would want in an Anderson Pak song is there so definitely looking forward to hearing what he's going to be doing soon and that has been the weekly track round up everybody thank you very much for watching again one more time shadow to our sponsor in this video seat geek link down below there in the description box and make sure to check out all the tracks down below we have linked to you and shout out one more time also to a hot dad and his new chowder man record alright you guys are the best I'll see you in the next one Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever 
ivSIL5lVKcQ,
8bHjPSqqv-4,hi everyone I'm actually sitting down here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new little Sims record gray area this is the latest full-length album from British rapper hole Sims who was turning heads back in 2015 with her breakthrough album a curious tale of trials and persons featuring the amazing single dead body which is a great intro to little Sims music if you are unfamiliar with her work she quickly followed this record up with a more ambitious and instrumentally dense release in 2016 stillness in Wonderland a record that was more fully realized than its predecessor but somehow more underwhelming though I did still appreciate the versatile blend of grime and jazz rap as well as R&B lace throughout this album so up until this point I've been more intrigued than blown away when it's come to little Sims music but I knew this new album was coming and I was super impressed by one of the lead singles - this thing boss a funky and spacious but aggressive track with the shrill ear-shattering screamed chorus step back away maja bold bold bold verses where Sims just sounds nice on the mic she just has this incredible attitude and energy and flow like she's just spent all this time competitively rapping or just like constantly throwing bars and it's ciphers and and now she's just like this well-oiled rap machine dropping tons of clever quotables stayed in my own lane never sidetracked i self-served let me prep it let me dice that your little rodents went and fell into my my strap and you did and you can send a kiss I'll never write back I also love the kind of glitchy embellishments throughout this stark and simple beat there's also this wonderful I am woman hear me roar kind of ethos to the track and honestly it gets to the root of what makes hip hop what it is the attitude and delivery the lyricism the competitive spirit so I went into this new album hoping I was gonna get more tracks that were equally impressive hold that were to the point and also served as strong proclamations of who little Sims is as an artist the opening track on this thing offense is exactly that with more grimy bass crispy drums lots of ambien noise around all of that in bars tougher than a purse take jay-z on a bad day Shakespeare on my worst days I said it with my chest and I don't care who I offend so many tracks on this thing just feel like the musical equivalent to little Simms rollin in with a tank and like this is me this is what I'm doing I'm not gonna apologize for it after a few hard intro tracks the album does mellow out but does not lose its flavor in the process the tracks selfish and wounds both offers some pretty smooth and sweet guest singers in fact there is actually not another featured rapper on this entire album it's all guest singers whether you are talking about Cleo Sol or contemporary reggae artist chronics or Swedish art pop and electro pop band little dragon singer/songwriter Michael Kiwanuka actually ends up on the last track here but to get back to the song selfish it is a very groovy and sensual track backed with pianos and strings and the track is about desire and attraction and wanting someone all to yourself by comparison the song wounds has a similar instrumental backdrop but a much drier composition and it's essentially a cautionary track about weighing the benefits of leading a life of crime for the glory of it idolizing gun-toting rappers while also getting to the heart of what drives these factors emotionally anyway the self hate the feeling that no one cares the peer pressure after this the quality production and lyrics on this album keep coming even though this is not a concept album there is a very strong instrumental theme to this record I love how stark again I'll use the word stark every beat on this thing is it's not super dense or lush or layered or anything like that which is a bit of a trend away from all the trippy trap beats we hear in every corner of hip-hop right now rather little Sims opts for a handful of key but very bold sounds in each instrumental and occasionally throughout these tracks you will hear some dramatic strings some jazzy embellishments that are maybe a little T PAB inspired some reverb Zoar echoes or vocal distortions that feel like they're coming out of the Kanye West catalog I love the space the string sections and the super-speedy flows that simms delivers on the track venom I'm also pretty enamored with the acute and nostalgic 101 FM where Sims takes a bit of a walk down memory Alaine over these cute far-east synth melodies and the references from her past that she picks up are so endearing whether it's making beats or playing mortal combat or just like rapping on the radio sims switches the mood of the album big time on the track pressure with these chilly ghostly group vocals haunting the tracks a very spacious mix the sad pianos and organic drums and pulsating chords all make for very nice touches in the instrumental and lyrically sims is referencing a variety of different pressures she feels bombarded by at any given time the black experience a cheating XOR this pressure to succeed from pressure we go to therapy which does make me kind of think there is an ingenious way that Sims sequenced the songs on this album and this track is essentially about unwinding having outlets having the ability to deal with and wrestle with your emotional demons and I guess the lack of fulfillment and utility that she gets out of therapy and not feeling like she needs saving lyrically the song of sherbert sunset also feels like it's continuing a narrative of some sort as the track dives deeply into the the failed relationship that Sims bitterly references in a handful of bars prior to this track so now she's going into the mistreatment the deception how emotionally invested she was in this relationship saying what a waste of chemistry energy and empathy wonder when you plan to let me know about her pregnancy you have no integrity emotion or respect for me clearly wasn't meant to be this is all temporary this is the clearest I've seen it was bound to end eventually it still hurts tremendously can't bear the intensity at one point saying in the song that she had this person worked into or would have this person worked into her Grammy speech would be amazing if this album got a Grammy the closing track flowers is a very soulful send-off to this tight and short but potent album while it's not the most cutting-edge thing I've ever heard and I am left wanting a little bit more when it's over there's not really a single point on this album where Sims falters to any great degree Lowell Sims verses are thoughtful and enjoyable throughout her performances are incredible the instrumentals are well put together and groovy and tasteful I love that she's able to successfully wear her influences so clearly on her sleeve without necessarily copying them to the point where she loses her own identity I love the myriad of emotions and feelings and experiences explored throughout this album - I think the flow is great I love that it is so consistent seriously this is a really great album again I am left wanting more after listening to this thing there are definitely some topics on this record I think Sims could have douve a bit more deeply into and maybe got some more profound statements out of I guess what I'm saying is there's definitely room for ambition to improve the wow factor of what Sims is doing because if only she could have had the the instrumental beauty and the density of stillness and wonderland but come through the record that is as hard-hitting and as just like fireworks is this still though I think Sims really outdid herself on this album and essentially reset the bar for UK hip hop in the modern era I'm feeling a decent too strong 9 on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well or over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantan oh little Sims gray area forever 
3ahSsfnXHyk,ah hi everyone freshly shaved Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new foals record part one everything I say will be lost this is the latest full-length album from uk-based indie and dance rock outfit foals now on their fifth record here in album that is actually set to be connected to a sequel album dropping later this year now despite my track record for loving pop and rock groups that emphasize groove the foals have never really resonated with me outside of their debut album which featured a way more frantic and noisy and mathematical sound than what the group is currently working with in fact every move the band has made since the release of that album has resulted in blander in blander music I'm not even that into the band's most well received album to date total life forever but it's been about four years since foals last album I did enjoy a few tracks leading into the release of the cell peace so I don't know maybe it's the dawn of a new era for the band maybe they'll bring some excitement back into the fold and that is sort of the case here the band does sound excited to be back especially on a pretty short run of songs right after the first few cuts on the album these song white onions features a very prominent and plucky guitar melody that might not be all that memorable in my opinion but it kind of makes up for that lack of memorability with some high velocity drumming cacophonous harmonies crashing into each other in with this roaring death from above 1979 style piece the track also features some of the most thrilling and shouty vocals foals have laid down in years on one of their records the song in degrees is another highlight for me on this record features this very bright shimmery synth loop that catches my ear immediately captivating groove fantastic rhythmic layers as the track progresses along also a very shouty and exuberant group chorus that reminds me of Talking Heads quite a bit like fear of music eyes Umbra era Talking Heads I also like the progression of the song syrups a lot to which kicks off with this very reserved clunky bassline that ticks along like clockwork the band lays some cavernous vocals on top it progressively gets a little washy a little be I'm just feeling the sound wash over me and eventually the band explodes into this building groove that gets more and more intense and eventually reaches one of the biggest climaxes on the entire record so there are some truly fantastic highlights on this album that in my opinion go toe-to-toe with some of the Bands best contemporaries when they were putting out their best work whether it be battles or or LCD soundsystem you could also list block party and I also want to mention everything everything a newcomer yes but still a group who I think over the years has been greatly inspired by the work foals have put in on their past albums so while I do like this handful of cuts the album unfortunately does not stay this consistently great throughout its entirety much of what surrounds these tracks to my ears just merely sounds okay or average you have some pretty tepid openers on this record the song moonlight features a lot of reverb and a lot of melodrama and for I'm not gonna say nothing but for not much these song exits is similarly washed out and kind of toothless as well despite it's driving groove and punchy kick drums it's got a lot of rhythm it's got a lot of momentum to it but the tune is pretty drab save for the prominent shouty and falsetto vocals the track on the Lunas sounds like an awkward transition from a progressive rock group of the 70s trying to adapt to the new wave wave of the 80s the slick guitar riffs crashing into a wall of glistening synths on this track it just doesn't really do all that much for me especially given how much these synths tend to swallow up a great deal of the mix I do appreciate the kind of in the moment organic and and what sounds like almost live sound the band is brought to this record but it has led to some recordings that I think are a bit smudgy and not in a complimentary way because on this track I really feel like I'm listening to pop rock but without the finesse I think a pop group should have meanwhile the track cafe to Athens sounds like what you would get if you took Radiohead's King of Limbs and replaced a bulk of the tones on that record with sounds that are a lot more plucky and percussive like if you had some kalimba or glockenspiel or xylophones all over the record I mean I guess it's alright certainly better than Sunday which sounds like a horrific ly boring in default outfit going electric for the first time only to deliver the least fulfilling song on the entire album the band eventually hits a kind of fast and explosive finish but the transition to get to that point isn't really that great nor do I think the first leg makes a the payoff worth it the very blissful and Rhoni closer is okay it's a moody piano ballad set against this very bright shimmery wall of synthetic sound again it's fine but I think it would be more gratifying if the lead up to this point had been more interesting overall I think this record was okay it was listenable definitely the band's most worthwhile effort in quite some time but I can't say I'm walking away from this record being all that excited for part two frankly I'm feeling a light six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to

fkZLt-L68l4,hi everyone spook the knee goes tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new spelling album Maisie fly this is the first full-length album on sacred bones records from a singer songwriter producer Chrystia Cabral aka spelling with three L's and after listening to this LP I am pretty impressed with how snuggly she fits into the dark atmospheric and kind of eerie aesthetic of that label but also stands out as one of their most exciting musical prospects at the moment her sound and style are so eclectic I'm gonna have a hard time compartmentalizing it in a succinct way because in my opinion the sound is not too unlike the cover as nearly everything that's presented on this album is delivered under a shroud of darkness and a bit of a soft focus but it's also a woman in what looks like a wedding dress and a cowboy hat laying in the hay with some cows and the cows are like a can I get that hay the instrumentation on this record is kind of rudimentary sounds very synthetic very analog synth although I'm not sure if it's true analog synths or anything like that there are tons of ways to mimic that sound these days the general vibe of these tracks and the performances on them are very minimal are very still mostly to make way for Cabral's very witchy and beckoning voice as well as the chilly atmosphere that surrounds nearly every track here the opening intro cut on this thing sounds like eerie synthesizer sound tracking what could be like a religious chant to my ears it would perfectly set the tone for something like becoming possessed and building off of this cabral doesn't come out on this record with like all guns blazing or anything like that if this album is blazing anything it's some ritualistic candles and sage because this is a seance these song haunted water features some very steady base scents pulsating along some very tight and sequenced beats feels like I'm slowly succumbing to the darkness or some kind of great spiritual power very strange slightly goth and a little hair-raising despite me not having much hair there's definitely some art pop going into this thing some ethereal wave a little bit of ambient pop and dream pop vibes to Lee song hard-to-please is soaked in this really shimmery and sharp echo and delay and also comes through with some of the loudest and boldest vocal harmonies on the entire record the mix is also wet with all these sour and kind of off-putting synth leads it's one of the shortest tracks here but somehow comes back later on the album with a reprise that sounds very much unlike the original song it's kind of like it grabs a few ideas from this first track earlier on the record and then flips those into a kind of dark funky R&B blend which actually stands out is one of the catchiest moments on the entire record and of course in embracing a more R&B oriented sound Chi does not forget those wavy kind of dark Halloween ish since then we have the song golden numbers whose title references the numbers of dates of New Moon's in the calendar year which also ties in with a pretty clear romantic theme as well song wise this track is more theatrical to my ears than it is tune full like we've suddenly transitioned into a pagan or goth high school musical number which might sound a little silly or dismissive but I enjoy the cut quite a bit and I think it does add to this albums kind of amateurish but authentically weird charm and adds to this running list of themes like planets and stars and the Sun and even extraterrestrial beings which we will talk about a little bit later the first leg of this LP features a lot of shorter cuts on this album maybe not as fulfilling or as built out as I would like them to be but around the halfway point it does start delivering more fulfilling cuts the song under the Sun is easily one of the best tunes on the entire record in my opinion under the Sun the track features a lovely sad chord progression these intoxicating melodies meanwhile the song real fun sounds like anything but real fun first track on the entire album to feature some prominent guitars and mostly sounds like a very dark and dank synth rock tune composed in a dungeon the track also comes with a crushing climax of just distorted guitar and heavy synth bass and these John Carpenter I'll lead melodies and I'm also kind of intrigued by the lyrics on this track which seemed to be about aliens coming to Earth because they think our music is cool like they're digging on Billie Jean and Billie Holiday honestly I hope the first thing aliens hear when they get here is is this record meanwhile the song afterlife is very Kate Bush Ian with its lavish and somewhat primped and whimsical intro also it's kind of prog rock inspired midpoint seems almost like she's pulling directly from records like never forever or the Dreaming also this track is one of many on this album that slowly transitions into completely unexpected territory as eventually Cabral finds herself singing against some very great sax lines now there are a lot of songs on this record that I enjoy and for the most part I really get a lot out of the odd personality of this record too however this album is not without its flaws sometimes to my ears the vocals do come off a bit too can't be a bit overacted the drums strings and vocals on the track secret thread don't come together all that tightly or at least as tightly as I would like some of the drum fills especially toward the start of dirty desert dreams a little rough overall I think this thing is pretty good but there are a handful of cuts on here that seem too enamored in their own mystical vibe to follow through with a full complete or coherent song or even deliver an effective performance not really anything I thought was overtly terrible on this record but still a good chunk of tracks that did leave me wanting more I don't think this album is going to be for everybody but if you are someone who loves their music to lean heavy on character and you're feeling a little odd and a little adventurous I would give this a shot I am feeling a decent seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit

M1SvOEAhll8,ah hi everyone asteroth annie world tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new juice World Record death race for love with it's amazing PlayStation came cover this is a new record from Chicago rapper singer-songwriter mr. juice world who threw a pretty major hit last year lucid dreams has found himself at the cutting edge of this new emo trap wave which is a style of music that sounds just as it is described you have trap beats and aesthetics being fused with the melodramatic and heartbroken vocals and lyricism of emo music this is a huge sound at this point that I think could be the next big phase for hip hop as a lot of newer artists who are hitting right now do have verses that trend toward being vulnerable and even confessional from more contemporary dudes like trippy red and even going as far back as Drake who has been around forever at this point but even though the sound is really popular right now it's been a kind of tumultuous couple of years for it because of some major losses of huge voices within the scene you're talking about xxx 10th Ozzy own and little peep but as long as the audience continues to demand this stuff this sound and style are probably not going anywhere anytime soon and speaking of giving the audience what they want on this record much of juice world's writing here sounds like it was directly influenced by the popularity of his own past singles the song maze off this record literally sounds like juice world copying over the entire lucid dreams formula onto this track changing the beat changing the sound a little bit altering the flow very slightly and whipping the melody up basically just recycling a lot of these used ideas and hoping to get another go around out of them there's also quite a bit of guitar sampling on this record or maybe just synth patches the sound like guitar either way more guitar presence and I would say the influence that 2000s emo pop has had on juice world's very nasally vocals on this album has increased at least two or three fold a lot of juice world singing and verses on these tracks varies between hilariously corny and profoundly depressing typically falling on a healthy middle ground between those two and even though there are a lot of listeners that might into what juice world does and instantly cringe when he does it well and brings through a very catchy song it actually speaks to me quite a bit and honestly despite his talent I think juice world does continue to be underrated as a lyricist many forget his hour-long freestyle I know there are quite a few songs on this thing that emphasize a very cute but depressing wordplay like these pills or my ProTools still got logic which is just one example of many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many lines on this album that referenced juice world's negative feelings and his heartbreak and his insecurities driving him to popping pills doing drugs even though juice comes through with some very clever wordplay on a majority of these tracks the bassline themes that most of these songs revolve around are not that varied which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're making a record that is emotionally potent is straightforward hits hard very catchy but deathrace for love is 72 minutes long and 22 tracks which is something that going into this record I did not want to believe would be a problem because you know for the most part I do like what juice world tries to do I like what he represents I thought maybe he'd pull through maybe it would be hits on hits on hits and maybe he would show audiences that he could kind of break his sound and style up try some new stuff take some risks and succeed but that's only sort of the case on this record there's some pretty good and amped tracks on this album where juice does try to give audiences a bit of a break from a lot of the druggie and sad ballads on this record but in the process of chasing after these more in-your-face sounds there is kind of a loss of personality the song syphilis is like a distorted SoundCloud banger which you can really hear juice chasing after in the second half when he is attempting ski masks kind of goofy fast triplet flows the song on God invites young thug onto a beat that you would usually hear on a young thug album a very glistening pretty smooth trap beat and juice roll ends up just sounding like a feature on his own song I do appreciate juice trying his best to break up the monotony of this very lengthy tracklist but the redundancy on this album really does set in on the last leg not only in terms of a lot of these songs sounding the same butt juice world kind of running out of song ideas to the song ten feet features some pretty decent rapping that sounds a little vintage to my ears it's got a good pace to it but the song eventually trails off in this weird instrumental outro that doesn't really go anywhere the tune on she's the one is so painfully sluggish I just can't wait for it to end the songwriter thematically am pretty sure juice world has already explored this topic to death of finding or we're having a significant other that will like ride for you is devoted to you and on this entire record I'm not sure if there's a more pointless song than make-believe a track whose instrumental is really tedious completely cluttered I hate the guitars in it melodically juice world isn't really doing much in the whole track brings no closure whatsoever to the entire record the first portion of this album does have a few misses in it but it hits a great stride and there is a point toward the end of this record where it completely loses sight of its own flow and ends up sounding like a jumbled pile of random songs that were maybe too clean to end up on the cutting room floor but weren't really great enough to feature on the first half of this album makes me wonder if juice world really understands what exactly about his music appeals to people because if you truly had a sense of that you wouldn't just be throwing anything that you made at the wall and hoping it would stick nor would you be literally copying over the equation for your previous hits and just trying to like redo them because instead of crafting a good coherent album juice world has gone culture too with it and it's just flooded fans with songs that he hopes turn out into an unexpected hit these rappers are like dropping compilations masquerading as albums at this point I do kind of respect that he didn't overload this album with features though even though I have an issue with how bloated and repetitive this album is that's not to say there aren't highlights on here the song empty to my ears feels like juice world 2.0 he's come back with essentially the same tricks but they're kind of fine-tuned so that he sounds even more depressing this time around and over an incredibly glamorous and beautiful instrumental feeling empty so goddamn empty also when he drops lines on this thing like I problem-solve with styrofoam I don't know whether to laugh or cry the track fast is another highlight for me incredibly hooky very mellow and hits hard despite it's very subtle presentation some of juices vocalizations especially on the hook kind of remind me of post Malone it does have this soft chill but catchy ballad post Maloney type feel I guess there is the hilariously titled he motions whose muddy emotions hook is catchy er than maybe I would like it to be despite how cringy I think some of the lyrics are the song robbery hands down is now my favorite juice world track not only for it's incredibly endearing and sad instrumental but also juice world's heart-wrenching performance on this thing tell me boom a hot in the bag and nobody gets hurt this chorus sounds like it was ripped straight I have like an old Fall Out Boy or simple plan album this is like the purest embodiment of emote rap period the song ring ring is one of the few fusions of hip hop and pop punk that I think I've ever enjoyed juice world singing his heart out about not wanting to pick up the phone and just be alone clever actually stuns on this song with his feature stands out is the best feature on the entire album my opinion is vocals just so over-the-top and immense emotionally even though that post mates line that he drops does kind of make me raise my eyebrow a little bit it does there's some great moments on here but honestly juice world waters the record down with a lot of songs that should have just ended up on a random friggin mixtape drop maybe several months after the release of this album because if you really wanted to boil this record down to its best and its finest moments you would have to throw out at least a third of this LP and that's sad that's unfortunate that sucks because at this point I still think juice is one of the more talented rappers singers and voices in the current hip-hop field he does punch under his weight lyrically sometimes because maybe he drops a lot of sad and sappy tracks that feature lyrics that fans of bars and braggadocio and just kind of macho attitudes and hip-hop might not mess with but you know he has tracks like out my way that are incredibly good equally good as some of the best sad cuts on this record and they feature exactly that badass angry attitude and they do it so well so juice world does have some great singles on here and he does have some amazing detours where he tries something a little different which would have provided some great variety on a shorter and more succinct album but instead he kneecapped this thing essentially for the sake of some extra dreams in the short-term and that's it I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i er view next to the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to

into the worst tracks of the week the worst tracks the worst tracks of the week the week first off a brand new song from Cal choo chesta you guys know him you like him for some reason and he makes garbage rap songs and this new one is maybe his most garbage yet the lyrics are essentially I got my rubber duck I got my pickup truck and then it just kind of like repeats from there he's got a lot of auto-tune on his voice honestly it sounds like a really awful playboy cardi ripoff and it's just pure garbage I'm not sure what else to say about it a shout out to Michelle who did the cover art for this thing we will link her Twitter down below you know but you know I'm still you know F Cal I'm still an F Cal mote because a the song sucks but we'll put a link down there where you can stream it so if you want to stream the sucky a song alright moving on from there not really all that big on the new khaled honestly it's titled my bad and the longer this dude is out the more sanitary pristine lifeless and boring his approach to ultra smooth and commercial R&B is just not really all that wowed by this track also not really wowed by the relatively lifeless new single from Gachet Feldstein which features vocals from Higham on the track which you'd think would would bring a little pep to the song but that's the exact opposite it's a very I don't know barren I guess I'll say in terms of anything interesting to hear any pulse any excitement passion it's it's really just I don't know just very emotionally flat and still I guess and not really in a way that's all that gratifying moving on from there let's get into the tracks I thought we're kind of met was it crazy about them still thought they were worth shouting out paying attention to giving a quick mention and we have a quick mention and we have a quite a few songs in this category to run through this week might not spend too much time blabbing about all of them but you know just letting you guys know Vampire Weekend I did a full length track review of the two new vampy week's tracks on the Fantana channel big blue and sunflower featuring Steve Lacey and truth be told I was kind of underwhelmed by these new cuts I thought the last two vampy week singles and teaser tracks were great these however are really drab one tracks has a bit of a jam band vibe but the tune at the core of it is okay but the instrumentation comes together in a really clunky awkward fashion that does not complement the track at all and Steve Lacey cut does have a blazing and fun and colorful guitar lick to it but not really much else moving on from there the mountain goats came out with a brand new track that honestly I don't know if I'm really looking forward to this new mountain goats record all that much I mean John Darnell's records aren't so hit or miss that he comes out with pure garbage but you know there are some albums of his that just don't really add up too much for me personally and I feel like with all the teaser tracks so far that's just the case as of right now maybe I need to hear the entire record and get a feel for whatever the narrative of this new album is to really get excited about tracks like this but honestly between the very stiff and driving guitars and John's kind of faint and under-delivered vocals there wasn't really anything all that's stunning about this a new song from them for me moving on from there but get up kids they have a new record on the way new song out which if you are a hardcore Get Up Kids fan I think you will like the pop punk e pepe and passionate delivery that they have on this new track over here satellite is the name of this new cut it's it's not bad it's pretty catchy pretty well written tropical Frisch's storm has a brand new cut out that I thought was again kind of understated and underwhelming definitely not as noisy and is glitchy and as overwhelming as a lot of the great tracks from your last full-length album this is more of a slow burner maybe a song that's gonna grow on me a bit more when they do drop a brand new record but still make no mistake about it these guys are one of the better and more interesting and cutting-edge Australian bands out there on the scene right now so do pay attention also that there's a very clear connection from the band to another great Australian band the drones so you know do keep your ears out if you're a fan of that band as well and if you aren't listen to them too moving out from there stephen malkmus of freaking pavement fame has a new solo record on the way he's dropped a brand new single these new singles from alchemist have really run the gamut from horrible synth pop Odyssey attempt to just very plain sounding indie rock on this new cut over here I mean I think there's like the potential for a great tune at the core of this thing here but he sort of diverts the songs into a lot of weird stops and directions to prevent it from sounding like maybe another track that's more popular that's already out there seems like it could be a pretty sweet and straightforward ballad but I think he kneecaps the tune of the track too many times for it to like really stick with me honestly moving out from there marshmallow and churches come through with a brand new track here with me which is actually not that bad the marshmallow beat is fun obviously churches bring those bright youthful kind of chirpy emotional vocals that are pretty sweet while I have not really been a big fan of either artists recent solo material you know I think they actually came together pretty well on this new track so I don't know if you're looking for a churches vocals on top of kind of an EDM beat with a pretty good tune at the core of it give it a shot I suppose moving on from there a Bibby o sound machine comes through the the the cutting edge group that fuses elements of Afrobeat with synth pop and post-punk and a myriad of other things brand new single and yet another one that I found kind of underwhelming honestly I guess we found a way is the name of this new cut it's a very slow burning ballad that just didn't really grip me frankly I mean it's very easygoing very relaxing it's got some pretty vocals on it but um you know just wasn't really speaking to me sunrise moving on from there we have another track I was I was recently hype on a single from this new Glen Hansard record and this new one over here while it does take a long time to get started does have an amazing and a climactic ending but maybe more listens to this thing eventually when I do get to the entire album you know the first portion which I do think is kind of underwhelming could definitely grow on me but um as of right now wanting a little bit more but still feeling relatively impressed especially by how incredibly crushing the finish of this song is and and the first leg of this track is so faint and so subtle you don't even see that explosion coming frankly moving on from there Freddie Gibbs and Madlib come through with a brand new cut bandanna featuring assassin honestly while I am really looking forward to this project and I think could potentially be one of the best rap records of the year I was not really all that Wow by this cut and for a myriad of reasons Mad Libs production on here is not really all that colorful Freddie Gibbs comes through with a flow that is eerily familiar and his chemistry with assassin is almost non-existent and assassins present presence on the track while he is here and you know he throws in you know some refrains on the track occasionally they're really not all that catchy you know I just feel like for the most part he's kind of killing air in between the Freddie Gibbs verses yeah just uh kind of bland and underwhelming frankly maybe more listens to it it'll it'll grow me but not really the banger of a single the last track was unfortunately moving on from there the Irish rock band Fontaine's DC comes through with a very slow and moving on from there the Irish rock outfit known as Fontaine's DC comes through with a a pretty sad and downtrodden song attached to a music video about a what sounds like a young man kind of coming to terms with responsibilities and fatherhood and and sort of growing through that it's it's a pretty introspective track that I think will definitely hit me in the fields a bit more once I hear the band's new full-length album which I hope is is dropping soon keep a freaking ear out people moving on from their foals has just dropped their new full-length album a lot of people talking it up maybe one of their best records and years I tend to maybe possibly agree given some of the singles thus far had been fire I do like the groove of this new cut over here that has been dropped and promotion of a this new album over here in degrees but honestly not really crazy about the vocals and then the song at the core of this one a little bland but um still groove is tight it's foals they got a tight groove set in their tool belt moving on from their earth has come through with a new cut that I think sonically takes a little bit back to their bees made honey days but honestly like the guitar licks and especially the drums are not really as impressive as they were during that era in the band's career if you're looking for something really slow and relaxing some very resonant and droning guitar music that really emphasizes a meditative state I recommend you give it a try I think any newcomers to Dillon's guitar style and guitar tone will most likely be impressed on some level and if you are I recommend you go back into the band's discography and you know get a hold of their more promising LPS but even though I am favoring the clearer and more beautiful and pristine sound of this new track over here they're just not really all that wowed by the playing but still new earth record on the way in a new earth record is certainly better than a lot of what we're hearing out there in the rock underground these days anyway so moving out from there Charlie he teams up with Denzel curry for kind of a banger I mean some of denzel's weirdest lyrics in a while turn up on this record you know kind of like some eyebrow-raising subs like really I don't know man that doesn't sound that hard but the beat goes on this thing the beat definitely goes Denzel does still bring his trademark fast and furious flow so Aloha is the name of this new cut give it a shot give it a try if you're looking for a banger let all the calm trues fans out there know that existence schematic is the name of this new track from the project still not a huge fan the throwback groovy 80s synth vibe that calm trues drums up but hey you know if it's you if it's your bag if it's your vibe if you love that retro sense stuff that's slightly chill wavy listen to it don't miss it give it a try I mean still not doing much for me but hey if it's if it's your thing it's your thing all right moving on from there Black Mountain has come through with one of their bolder tracks in a while if you do love 70s the 70s somewhat hard and kind of prog rock throwback groups that used to be larger in number from what I remember in the mid and late 2000s they're kind of dwindling off and Black Mountain is one of the few out there from that era that's still kind of kicking and for good reason they were easily one of the best of that moment in time and they clearly still are you know if you love that vintage proggy heavy riff oriented sound of the guitar work on this new track over here is actually pretty great it's actually pretty impressive give this thing a shot future shade is the name of this new cut over here Andrew bird has a new song out which is a pretty decent ballad not all that wowed by the indie folk instrumentation which is a pretty average for him frankly but the the tune at the heart of this track I think is one of his a sweetest and and most compelling in a while and now we are moving into best tracks territory best tracks territory which we also have a few have quite a few of as well we're getting through a lot of songs in this episode honestly which is kind of why I'm blowing through a lot of them because we've got a lot to get to and remember all these tracks that we're talking about they're all linked down below so you know if any of this stuff strikes your fancy give it a shot give it a listen all right we have a brand new track from ybn chordae who as of this point right now to me is like the most promising member of the ybn group and comes through with bars on bars on bars on bars very smart clever funny and in heart hitting on this new track over here which again is titled have mercy and you know just kind of just bars on bars on top of a good quality beat freaking teairra wack has a brand new cut out which is wild eccentric it's weird it's fun she continues to kill it I just wish there was a bit more hype around what she was doing right now because she's like really putting her eccentricity like out there and the brightest and most fun and enjoyable way and and I think more people need to take to that it's a pretty imaginative what she's doing I think moving on from there the National has a brand new track out new record on the way you had your soul with you is the name of this new cut and this is actually kind of an interesting change of pace for the National this song is a little bright kind of hopeful kind of positive a little sweet on the ears the lead vocals are Madana fashioned right usually used to hearing on a national album and the guitar work is edited and manipulated in a way where it kinda has the sweet glitchy left-field quality to it it's actually kind of a great track really looking forward to seeing what the national pull out of this direction especially given that their last record was my favorite of theirs in years so I feel like this is a you know a bright new frontier for the band honestly the Black Keys are back weawy weawy with Black Keys are back whoa lo hi is the name of this new track over here it's got some pretty vintage and classic guitar playing on this thing it's got some I don't know just just feels like a real sweet throwback I guess maybe not as punky with its energy as some of the Bands older and most classic material you know used to have when it came to playing hard rock and blues rock and and you know soul infused rock and that sort of thing but I don't know the production on this one it's pretty lush it's pretty impressive and it certainly seems like it's got more of a pulse and more flavor to it than anything off the band's last full-length album so I guess I'll leave it at that you know I feel like from that record the band could only go up and you know low high definitely has my ears ears excited my interest piqued alright quali Chris comes through with a new cut going in a direction that I honestly never really expected from them I mean the dude songs are typically pretty odd and left field and just strange to the ear this nuanced straight shot is actually kind of soulful and chill and sweet a lot of some vocals on this track a lot of features as well it's pretty passionate I guess and and Chris sort of shows another side of him I guess and I'm sort of liking the the consistent gun theme we're putting throughout all the songs sort of you know released so far from this thing it's proving to be an interesting sort of project that is shaping up here Matt most has come through the new track I've been praising this duo's music pretty much every week so far because they keep dropping new tracks if you love wild sample heavy electronic music that is way off the beaten path and just like so far down the weird rabbit hole give it a listen give it a shot do not do not miss it please like you know support Matt mows because they're freaking awesome and the crying pill is the the name of this new track Mac DeMarco has a brand new single out as well which I did a full length review of on the Fantana channel loved this one it's a very low-key very minimal very straight back ballad but I do feel like the song is great it's a great song you know singing is great it's it's faint it's quiet but it's emotional and it's potent I'll just leave it at that power and simplicity for Mac DeMarco I guess also with it with a similar sort of like cover art orientation here we have a brand new single from from idk a trigger-happy bars on bars on bars great energy great flow great delivery on this track it's hard as Frick dude he's just going off and and I'll leave it at that Tia tomorrow brand-new track from well actually not brand new I missed it it came out a little while ago a little while ago but its total banger it's from doja cat features Rico nasty and love the very playful and tongue-in-cheek and quirky and funny and super raunchy lyrics on this thing the beat is amazing the Ricoh nasty feature is totally bra and disgusting one of the most fun you know female on female bangers of 2019 period going on from there cupcake comes through with a brand new trick bird box which actually ties into a very funny bar on this track the bird box line is very funny um kind of standard beat for cupcake honestly but man she's just she's just wild she's freakin wild on the microphone like she says nothing but insane fucking shit and that's really all I have to say and I'm just consistently impressed with the insanity that she brings on the microphone and I'll just leave it at that like she's really going in Ranchi places and also like pulling out bits of wordplay that I don't other here right I just don't hear other rappers doing and I'll leave it at that moving on from there The Chemical Brothers actually have a pretty decent new track out which if you look it up they also have a like a super-fast remix of this song allegedly like the fastest remix ever so they came out with the fastest remix ever of their own new single we've got to try is the name of this new cut actually features are pretty stunning but weird lead vocal and you know kind of a throwback weirdo house B and it's got a great groove to it and I like the progression of it you know it's pretty cool moving on from there i Fricks heavy with this new Charlie Bliss single really loving how effectively the band are embracing like these synth pop and pop rock vibes on these latest singles but there's not like losing their vocal and their performative edge on these tracks this track over here they just dropped is incredibly catchy chat room is the name of this new one and it's attached to a really fantastic music video that sort of dives into um cults and I guess called behavior to cage the elephant has a brand new cut out which is very weird it's very tense it's very lyrically leans on the lyrics kind of heavy it's very dark and I will leave it at that do not miss it do give it a shot - definitely giving me hope for the new record even though the last one I thought was kind of underwhelming the last single last teaser track Billy Eilish I actually have enjoyed her new track over here what is it wish wish you were gay is the name of this new one over here it's very low-key the lyrics are very odd kind of sweet in missed connections romance kind of way and I I guess very confessional and kind of revealing you know I I don't really get anything out of her last couple of tracks that she dropped from this new record of hers which everybody is freaking hype for but honestly this this is the first one where ballad wise and Eirik why's it actually like you know stuck with me a little bit so I guess I'm looking forward to hearing more tracks like this hopefully there are this new record of hers and all your sisters is going to be the last track we shoutout in this list it is a brand new track from a band that I'm familiar with honor the flen sir and the name of this new song is self-medicating and it is this amazingly crushing like super noisy intense piece of industrial noise rock oh it's a pretty decent vocals and very heavy like very very shrill at points production which I'm liking a lot so you know definitely give it a shot if you love old-school swans you know I think you'll get into a what the band is doing here aesthetically at least

Lml7J8uSfIo,hi everyone Nicola me back Tannen oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Weezer record The Black Album this is the latest full-length album from alternative rock legends Weezer who have had a pretty busy past couple of years we're not even three whole months into 2019 and we already have a Weezer covers album a new record of originals and who can't forget the band's recent and headache-inducing attempt at writing millennial pop on Pacific daydream Weezer has really been back on a somewhat rocky road ever since the release of what I thought was their best album in years the White Album in 2016 and despite things being a little more lackluster than I'd like recently I did go into this new album with kind of high hopes because from Pacific daydream I feel like you really have nowhere to go but up and also teal for all of its flaws and even though it was a covers album it was still pretty fun and a few of the teaser tracks going into this new album I thought were pretty promising the track can't knock the hustle which seems almost like a meta commentary on rivers creative process his work ethic Weezer's miraculous ability to continue to thrive despite lackluster albums and a dwindling market for rock bands the instrumental on this track felt like a versatile throwback from the 90s fusing elements of pop and rock and hip hop throw on a refrain and espanol for good measures so [Music] so why don't you kill me these songs Amba bastards is a kind of fun quirky pop rock tune without any edge to it whatsoever this song would not hurt a fly though the lyrics do sort of seem to focus on haters shit stalkers naysayers who rivers on this song essentially paints as zombie bastards hey maybe even I'm a zombie bastard okay buddy you trying to get cut the track also features a super-sweet bridge that I like quite a bit and even though it drifts the album further into a direction that is not at all reflective of a black album the piano ballad on high as a kite is beautiful it is euphoric it is deeply moving we go from dealing with and hating on zombie bastards two rivers lyrically placing himself in a spot where he has not a care in the world with no pain no pleasure he's just like a emotionless husk that has reached a Zen state however my favoritism toward these songs starts to drop around living in LA which I thought was a very boring piece of pop rock that is trying way too hard to shoot for a wide appeal with it's perfectly tracked and calculated instrumentation I mean if rivers and company really wanted to nail a hit on this track they could have just brought a better song to the table not a recording that is so pristine it sounds basically lifeless because if anything is going to attract anybody to this song it's not going to be the lyrics which are just whining about liking a girl while living in LA and feeling kind of lonely the track really does bring like this maroon 5 level of lyrical substance and you know at this point in the tracklist I was not worried because I think that Weezer can make a great album can get by with a good album featuring just like one or two kind of bad or lackluster tracks I expected at least a couple at this point but honestly the second half of this thing really does take a big fat nosedive and basically turns into the sequel of Weezer's make-believe as the band essentially dishes out another helping of completely soulless pop rock which is just baffling at this point in 2019 because I feel like it made sense to make an album like make believe back when there was more of a radio market for the type of thing Weezer was doing but the song just being honest for example while I don't mind the tune of this track I actually think at its core it's it's one of the better songs on the record but who is lining up to hear a song that sounds like this in 2019 the structure is so formulaic and the performance is so flat and plain and even that by the midpoint I feel like I get psychic abilities and I can just predict the rest of the song and then not only the sound but also the songwriting goes right into the toilet on following tracks like too many thoughts in my head and the prince who wanted everything the prince honestly might be the corniest thing that Weezer has written this decade I would read through some of the lyrics but I already have indigestion meanwhile the song Byzantine is like Weezer's attempt at a Kokomo except they wish it was anywhere near as enjoyable as Kokomo it's just a fall flat on your face attempt at were castrating some really tacky tropical flavored pop music like this is what your conception of Caribbean style music is if your exposure to it is through top 40 rock hits and video game soundtracks and novelty records the closer California snow is another moment on the album where I actually enjoy the the tune at the core of this track quite a bit I think the chorus soars beautifully but the production once again kind of sucks any fun out of the sound of this song on top of it it awkwardly kicks off with this like trap style descending snare build up like Weezer is going sicko mode or something this is so disappointing Weezer can just literally not dig themselves out of this hole right now and that does not make me happy it really is disappointing for somebody who thinks maybe a few of the band's most hated records or not as bad as some haters make them out to be who thought that between everything will be alright in the White Album we were on a path of healing and growth and progression that was going to be good for the band sound about at this point I feel like we're just in a in a very different place and I'm not exactly sure where we're headed at this point truly and honestly I'm feeling a decent too strong for on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to

qmBJ4Nj5fec,huh hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for another edition of why you no review where I go over a series of Records that I didn't get a chance to do a full length review on over the past month or so I compiled them together into a gauntlet style of short form opinions in this video let us go if you are a big fan of noisy somewhat shoegaze e indie pop and rock I think it will definitely get into this although I personally don't really find the the sonic experimentation of this record to really go deep enough the vocals are often kind of lost in the haze and I do not find them to be all that distinct but still generally the sound of this thing is pretty lush and there are a few catchy tunes to be heard on it so if you're looking for some alternative rock some underground indie rock with somewhat blissful and ensuite vibe to it give it a shot talking about the latest record from snakes that lands on merge records she is a pretty creative up-and-comer that had a few teaser tracks to this LP that I thought were pretty great there are a lot of elements of this album that I liked a lot I liked some of the art pop and alternative dance and minimal synth and post-punk elements of this record there are a lot of ideas though that I find to be way too short of breath and faint to really leave that big of an impact on me but in its best moments this album is incredibly forward-thinking creative catchy and also reminds me a little bit of like a young m.i.a or something like that obviously way more low-key and toned down but still that kind of funky danceable weird alternative element also santi gold a little bit as well I feel like there's a big influential vibe coming from both of those artists as well as other things on this new album over here I'm just hoping that whatever sneaks does into the future is a bit more sizeable and focused and a bit louder and bolder because I think there are so many good ideas on this record that would go across so much better they just been you know handed over in a much more energetic fashion I guess but hey if you're looking for something chill and weird and very versatile and maybe not something that's demanding your attention too much but has quite a bit of variety and is a little all over the place creatively give it a shot I mean I think there are a lot of good ideas here it's filthy it's disgusting it's vile and it's one-dimensional pretty much everything piss crave does on this album they did on their last full-length record in while I do like how filthy and and gross and maniacal that album is from a sonic perspective you know sometimes the riffs and the songwriting weren't that great and I feel like now that I've gotten a full whiff of this new record over here it's it's slightly worse it's it's slightly less interesting so yeah I just feel like this is a very repetitive sequel to the first album but now the novelty of the band's sound and style is completely out the window and they haven't really built on in any significant way outside of maybe making the vocals sound a bit crappy er I don't know it's whatever [Music] hip-hop heads young and old please do not let this new posthumous Sean Price record with small professor doing production from front to back slit by you because it is actually pretty great of course given that Sean Price did pass a while ago small professor doesn't have an incredible amount of material to work with here some of the material on this thing is remixed stuff but there are some good features on here some great production and Sean Price sounds as grimy as we've known him to be not really a whole lot to complain about on this thing just left wanting more but if you're just looking for some really badass just very gritty hip-hop music do not miss out on this [Music] my thoughts on the new Wicca phase springs eternal record here if you are a huge fan of this new wave of acoustic emote rap then I think you will definitely get into this record there are some elements of it that reminds me of a little peep but maybe a bit more lyrically mystical and deep a bit darker a bit more despondent there are some elements of it that kind of remind me of bones however the acoustic bits I find to be very bland the beats I find to be very average and while I do think that Wicca phases music does remind me of those two pretty significant artists there's not really much about this album that surpasses the sounds of of either of them so I don't know if this is a sound you're crazy about you're just dying for this style for this vibe then definitely give it a shot because if you're just kind of looking for more you will most likely get into it but I personally don't really find it to to stand out Liz Harris has come through with a new record through another yet another a new side project and it's a handful of tracks some of which are very lengthy not very crazy about the repetitive nature of the last couple of songs on this thing as they mostly take off of the very last leg of the second track on this album but still the first two cuts on this thing actually feature some very amazing wide and colorful ambient sound palettes yes they are a bit lengthy but they are also pretty ambitious undertakings the overall flow or lack thereof of the album as a whole leads me to believe that maybe these songs are just kind of one-off experiments or this project isn't really destined for anything other than just a b-sides type treatment but still I think a lot of the sounds Liz draws up on these cuts are some of the most compelling she has played with in years and I would love to hear or put out more ambient compositions like these may be on another album that features a more fulfilling tracklist I guess [Music] the new Mercury Rev album even though I'm not crazy about it it is a really ambitious undertaking that I think music fans need to pay attention to as the group essentially goes back and does a song for song cover of an old Bobbie Gentry record Bobbie Gentry if you don't remember is this old skool soul country songstress and there are some pretty great songs on Delta sleet's the record that Mercury Rev covers on this album track 4 track 4 track and coming along with them to cover all of the songs on this Bobbie Gentry album are a league of really impressive vocal guests everyone from Lucinda Williams to Marisa Nadler I think even Phoebe Bridgers is on here as well so if you're a big female singer-songwriter fanatic and you care about some of the classic voices in that genre some of the newcomers that have been making a lot of noise you will not want to miss this album I'm not super crazy though about Mercury revs consistently Spacey and toothless approach to covering a lot of these tracks it is maybe a little too atmospheric a little too lifeless at points I wish there was more variation to this album into these versions on that end but still it's a pretty interesting series of tracks some of which are very good and the sounds of this record generally if you do love droney ambient chilly spaced out music are very relaxing and are kind of serene maybe even foreboding but still very easygoing and very even-tempered sometimes even eerie and chilling and haunting hopefully I've done an adequate job of selling this record I do think there are some very admirable qualities to it and if you do fancy yourself a big fan of singer songwriters this is not to be missed [Music] thoughts on the new health record I think it's okay you know it's a little one-dimensional unfortunately I do really like the aesthetic the band is taking on this record I love the heavy distorted abrasive industrial sounds packed throughout this album the songwriting though is not nearly as vibrant or as hard-hitting or as memorable as the sounds this album presents also the very indirect and distant vocals that are sort of laced throughout the entire LP do get a little tiresome after a while a little redundant don't really bring that much of variation across the entirety of the LP but still some of those crunchy heavy crushing shots of industrial noise and riffs however the band are creating them do feel very satisfying there is an amazing orgasmic loud soft dynamic to this record that is very satisfying I just wish the band did more to provide more memorable tracks across this record to provide a better songwriting across this record because at its best it really just kind of feels like a bit of an industrial rock throwback to the days of a lot of those big groups in the genre from the late 90s and early 2000s a lot of which I listened to in high school but it's a tad more aggressive a tad more noisy but not necessarily as memorable [Music] can't say I was really expecting all that much from this new Avril Lavigne album but Jesus it is a glitzy over produced bland piece of singer-songwriter pop without much in the way of flavor or personality to it there is that Nicki Minaj single on here which sounds like it would have done a lot better maybe back in 2005 as it is kind of colorful and zany and annoying but in a good way in a way that makes it feel like it would have actually hit a lot harder several years ago but now it just sticks out like a sore thumb amongst a series of songs that are about as soulless as singer-songwriter pop gets really given taylor swift o run for her money here while i was looking forward to this record based off of nina cried power in the tracks that were attached to that EP that was released not too long ago the album now this new hozier record is a huge pop sold disappointment I mean it has this faux rustic aesthetic to it that feels kind of gritty and and feels kind of rootsy and and that entices me but at the core of it the songs on this thing run like a corny inspirational poster they're totally gross overly saccharine almost patronizing at points and I just don't really get much out of the stories and the tunes behind these tracks again I do kind of like that rustic aesthetic and that Mavis Staples track is amazing and every once in a while this album will pull out a heartfelt ballad that feels a bit deeper than some of the top 40 again faux rustic pop soul that hozier is trying to sling on most of this record but it does not happen enough for this record to be listenable all the way through for me usually I end up tapping out just out of sheer annoyance over the shallowness of a lot of this songwriting [Music] new Luna ep if you're unfamiliar with current kpop trends Luna is easily one of the largest and most popular all-female groups in this current wave of kpop and this new record it's okay it's got a few very fun and bubbly singles on it some very bright fusions on this thing of top and EDM a little R&B the production is very lush it's very pristine but I think it's all really like primped and cleaned up to the point where it feels almost sterile which is is not even really my issue specifically with kpop but a lot of pop a lot of mainstream pop in general and I just think that this EP suffers from that very same problem as well sadly [Music] No was initially excited for this new higher brothers album not only because I thought a few of the singles leading into it were kind of hard-hitting a little exciting but also the feature list on this album is really impressive and some of the performances from the likes of Denzel curry are fantastic but as an album experience I just kind of found the record to be a little obnoxious like every member is trying a little too hard to just sound really out there and wacky not exactly sure what that's all about and then you do have the occasional feature on this thing like from schoolboy q that either it sounds really phoned in or it just wasn't mixed into the beat all that well so it just kind of sits on top of it in a really awkward way so there are some elements of the album that do get stale over time some weird blemishes that I think could have been fixed before they released this thing to the wider public not sure how relevant all of this is to the group's popularity though as their singles do continue to drive more listeners to them and their profile and China continues to be pretty big but if you're looking to hear some somewhat quality pop rap and trap rap from a group that has a take on it from outside of US borders then give it a shot I've had some people asking me about this new methyl ethyl record and I'm just really not seeing what is so thrilling about it I mean maybe some listeners are finding it to be incredibly catchy as this record does seem to be a pretty clear blend of indie pop with some very fun and colorful neo psych elements but the singing throughout a lot of this record I think is really rough the songwriting occasionally can be really shoddy and sometimes the performances in the production itself can feel a little shoddy too I think there are some decent ideas presented here every once in a while but I don't think they're really going to resonate as much as methyl ethyl might want them to unless they're cleaned up quite a bit and have a bit more punch in terms of just memorable pop songwriting I don't know why but I listen to it I listen to the whole goddamn thing and it's like every bad piece of cliched pop rock and and even a terrible hardcore punk song that you can imagine I just don't know who exactly is channeling their suburban white rage into a Papa Roach album anymore the lyrics on this thing suck they suck at first the new pond record seemed like it would be a pretty interesting prospect not only given the very colorful and somewhat psychedelic cover art of this new one but Kevin Parker of all people is actually involved in the production on this one and while I do appreciate the band trending away from the hugely hypnagogic and blatantly Arial pink inspired sounds of their last record I can't really call this new move from the band all that exciting or memorable I feel like their compositional qualities and their vocals continue to be pretty bland not all that stand out but I guess the recording quality continues to be good the group sounds like they play together pretty tightly pond for me just continues to be one of those groups that they're obviously not an awful band they have quite a bit of talent to do what they do and I find their music to be pretty Pleasant while it's on but there's just something about it that doesn't really blow me away just a lack of defining characteristics that prevent me from going back to the album because it's not really giving me much to want to come back to given some of the online hype I've seen surrounding this I sue areum album I thought I would be in store for a bit more than I actually was but at the end of the day I feel like this record while it is well done in some respects it's pretty much just some very standard gloomy heavy atmospheric a little smudgy death doom metal it is very grim and nasty and foreboding at times unforgiving but vocally compositionally especially in terms of the riffs there weren't a whole lot of passages on this thing that really stood out to me I really dig the aesthetic and the atmosphere but not a lot about the writing on this thing that really truly says to me hey remember this come back to this get addicted to this for the most part whenever I listen to this record it just kind of sits in my head as a very vague memory of what it is aesthetically and not necessarily musically the news Sleaford mods record which I was kind of looking forward to I was hoping the duo would bounce back in a hard way after their last full length album key markets which I thought was a little so-so seeing the group kind of paint themselves into a corner I thought was a bit disheartening and I do appreciate the duo trying to get out of their comfort zone on this one the rickety post-punk II vibe of their usual instrumental palette does get swapped out a bit for some new wave elements for some sounds that feel like they're inspired by just electronic music generally the sound palette of this record is a lot more synthetic they also take a chance on some more melodic lead vocals more melodic hooks and yet it also feels like they're kind of stripping things back a little bit to the simplicity of a record like divide and exit with that being said though all these changes haven't necessarily led to an exciting new album in my opinion though a lot of the shouted and spoken-word vocals not only do they feel predictable at this point but on a lot of cuts from this record they are kind of toned down in such a way where they are just blatantly underwhelming that once fiery blue-collar rage that informed the duo's best material up until this point it's mostly disappeared aside from a handful tracts that appear on the back end of the record of course there are some tracks on here that make some hilarious and essential societal critiques especially from a class perspective the second cut on here is a prime example of that but once again I'm just kind of walking away from another Sleaford mods record just wanting more unfortunately thank all of you for watching this latest edition of the why you know review you can check out a playlist of videos in

AMzn7ZGCqgY,hi everyone rapidly tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new to change record wrap or go to the league this is the latest record from Georgia rapper 2 Chainz who despite his age at this point he's really not that much younger than jay-z is still seen as a relatively fresh face in the current rap landscape while 2 Chainz and at one point titty boy has been at it for years it still been less than a decade since his Def Jam debut with based on a true story and album I didn't really like all that much when I initially reviewed it it has grown on me since then because even though in some respects this album may be super materialistic kind of basic a little rudimentary 2 Chainz has a wild eccentric personality that just I can't get enough of when he's at peak 2 Chainz anyway sadly most of 2 Chainz output past this point has been nowhere near as bold we have the predictable and unambitious boats to his flop of a collaborative album with little Wayne pretty girls liked rap music was kind of a return to form but 2 Chainz unfortunately on this record was kind of drowning in mediocre features and rapper go to the league is not nearly as out there as some 2 Chainz fans might want him to be but it does present an interesting change of pace their bangers on here their pop rap anthems there are totally over the top and tongue-in-cheek lyrics yes but this album is also 2 Chainz most personal record yet I guess you could say his most mature especially on the first leg of this thing as he trips down memory lane thinking about playing basketball and his aspirations to keep doing that dominated his youth rapping about his family and his loved ones that he's lost the cycle of crime and poverty and violence that many black youth find themselves caught in it's not exactly the most deep and detailed dive into these topics you're ever gonna hear but being someone who survived these obstacles 2 Chainz does have some compelling things to say on these topics as well as some regrets to air out there are moments on these cuts where his delivery Falls a little flat like on threat to society but you can tell he's still speaking from the heart as he's riding on top of this classic soulful 9th wonder be the production on money in the way sounds like something fans of Kanye's beats in the early and mid tooth with love and even though 2 Chainz doesn't litter this entire album with super deep and personal tracks a lot of the themes from these initial songs on this album do pepper throughout a lot of the lyrics on the rest of this album so while this album does kick off kind of mellow and emotional it does not take long for chains to start coming through with his usual blend of slightly weird and quirky track bangers I do like the attitude and the vibe of statute of limitations even if there aren't that many zany quotables coming out of the song 2 Chainz and young thug on the next track are a pretty logical marriage of voices but honestly thugger demands way more attention on the song than 2 Chainz does who mostly just sounds like he's an autopilot the Travis Scott feature on the next cut of course drives the song into a psychedelic wash of effects and I don't know what to say about this track other than that it's getting really obnoxious that Travis Scott seems to be the special case and rap right now we're having him on your track means a top-to-bottom build around his sound and around his style it's like if you had a particular friend who when you had over your house you had to arrange the furniture and it to his liking and of course 2 Chainz is doing this because he wants to fit in that current wave of trippy psychedelic psycho mode trap but at the end of the day this track and many recent Travis Scott features just sound like a watered down version of a song that could have been on that album and Astroworld left over I actually don't think 2 Chainz drops a classic 2 Chainz cut on this record until n-c-double-a where I use good like it's lotion is most likely the most ridiculous bar on this entire record the heat turns up on mama I hit a lick which features one of the most quirky and clunky instrumentals on the entire album 2 Chainz performance here is insane Kendrick Lamar's feature is one of the most subdued he's ever done but there's kind of a strange quality to it that grabs your ear really quickly 2 Chainz and Ariana Grande crossed paths once again on the track ruled the world which kind of sounds like a classic pop rap and R&B blend from the 2000s with some gorgeous synth strings and some glamorous pianos and some boom bap e beats it's pretty formulaic it's not blowing me away or anything but it is nice to hear 2 Chainz make it a to transition into writing more romantic verses on this thing I like the song two-dollar bill a lot but with 2 Chainz insistence that he's rare that he's special that he's different he's pretty much written this song already it was the song I'm different off of based on the true story except now it's got a really great little Lane and an e 40 feature the instrumental vibe of both of these tracks is even eerily similar the song I said me is another highlight for me on this record it is one of the more introspective cuts off of this thing but it's delivered in this very frank and blunt way where it seems like 2 Chainz is almost embracing humor a little bit I mostly like the song for its verses that dive into and unpack some of the dark pathways that have brought 2 Chainz to this point in his life although the vocal sample of my favorite things laced into the beat is a little unnecessary it drags the intro out way too long and the few shots that it pops up within the core of the track just sounds really tacked on there are definitely highlights on this record there are tracks that I see as kind of passable or average for 2 Chainz but there are a handful of low points as well 2 Chainz very awkward and kind of sung hook on I'm not crazy life is is completely horrible it definitely doesn't do the songs pretty strong theme justice nor the quality chance the rapper and even Kodak black features there's the obnoxious diamonds are a girl's best friend and then also the closing tracks Sam which is I guess an explanation of how taxes work it just seems really tone-deaf to drop a track like this given the current state of wealth inequality and how prevalent this conversation is becoming in the political mainstream like obviously these societal problems are not 2 Chainz fault I don't really care how many millions 2 Chainz has in the bank off of rapping and real estate investments and I can see in the lyrics he's kind of working his way out of his feelings over this and saying hey I've been on both sides the poverty side and the success side but honestly it still feels like an out-of-touch lament and a struggle that's hardly worth dwelling over what exactly the point or the takeaway was for the track I don't know and why it tops the album off as if it's like this significant emotional statement I don't know why either overall this album is decent it's got a lot of listenable cuts on a handful of pretty good ones it does get a little shaky toward the end and I'm not sure if some fans are really going to take all that well - 2 Chainz getting kind of deep and kind of woke and maybe even a little uh politically charged in the first leg of the record while I don't mind it and I think it certainly shows a refreshing side of 2 Chainz that's not really been his MO up until this point and I don't know if his fans are really demanding that message or that sound from him still feeling a light - decent 6 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as

jV_IjRE6QTM,steal her man steal her man yeah hey yeah hey hi everyone Yanni hey stand up here internets it's just music nerd itchy on the back it she got it oh I got it it's time for a review of the new blue and oh no record a long red-hot Los Angeles summer night this is a new collaborative album from two underground hip hop middleweight champions blue and Ono who have both dropped quite a few albums over the years and have existed in the same atmosphere for quite a while I'm surprised we haven't seen more crossover from these two already at this point I did go into this new album a little skeptical because a lot of Blues recent output has been kind of hit or miss but his catalogue truly has everything from modern classics like below the heavens weird detours surprise collabs underappreciated gems like his lo-fi hip-hop double album opus good to be home and what blue fan can forget Warner Brothers kneecapping his shot at the mainstream with his New York record in 2011 and he also has projects under his belt that are so messy they make you worried about his well-being Ono has been dropping albums for a bit longer and is almost as prolific as his brother Madlib and his relative obscurity and the grander scheme of hip hop does not reflect this man's talents especially considering how much material he's dropped too he's collaborated with and how great he is at straying together these samples of soul and funk and jazz and two very coherent and creative hip hop beats so this new record from blue and Ono it is 17 tracks 48 minutes and I think it is defined by two clear characteristics one cohesion as blue and Ono complement each other's respective styles so well and not in such a way where they cancel each other out and just go on autopilot because working together is is easy actually the opposite I think blue and Ono bring the best out in each other on this record and cause one another to get more ambitious and then there's also clarity I think this album also brings a soup REME amount of clarity and what I mean by that is that both of these artists are working at a level of precision and sharpness that I have not heard from either of them in a long time like almost a decade lyrically and flowise Bleu is in top form on pop shots as well as the lost angels anthem both of these tracks I highly recommend as a taste test for anybody who is unfamiliar with these artists or is just trying to get a bit of an intro to this record meanwhile Ono's production on this thing is consistently colorful and eclectic and in groovy really defined and really lush to the point where it's almost like he's orchestrating live instrumentation in these instrumentals and there's some pretty stunning and quality guest singers on this thing - brandy prices harmonized vocals on the track murder case are bold and authoritative and ear grabbing because he is cool and laid back singing on the lost angels anthem is really sensual and fantastic - the instrumental moods on this record kind of range from nocturnal and sort of psychedelic like on Boogie 2 flex which has all these twinkling cascading notes overlapping on each other the instrumental for round about midnight is villainous and punchy features these sour piano chords and gargantuan bass and horn hits like something out of a vintage cartoon or an old-school detective show but just flipped into a hard as diamonds be there multiple instrumentals on this thing that just contain mad villainy levels of genius like the plucky lead melody samples on the track stalkers which are pretty cinematic a lot of the time on this thing oh no does it sound like he's just merely making a beat on this album but creating a sense of place and making a scene for blue to act within as he drops passionate ODEs to LA or comes through with conceptual cuts like robbery a story song where blue is literally robbed following not too long after this we have the song liquor store which is like a heated game of phone tag where they're kind of reacting to the story from the robbery up until this point and how they're going to handle it and this is just the start of the smart and vivid concept tracks that are peppered throughout this record you have the incredibly paranoid stalkers whose title definitely reflects its you have the brash gun talk on pop shots and the way this track narrative Li glides into do the crime and murder case facing time the jail cipher and the ending cut fresh out while it may not be incredibly clear at the start of the record this album ties up into a pretty dark story but delivers a mostly happy and strong and coherent ending this album overall is so well done and I'm surprised I'm not hearing more fanfare over it I mean granted blue and Ono aren't exactly reinventing themselves on this album and the story being told on this record isn't the most original under the Sun but it does flow very well and as far as execution goes blue and Ono are putting out some of their best work to date on this thing this record has hooks it has great quality verses it has grit it has a narrative it has personality it has wonderful instrumental flavors I think the biggest shortcoming that this album offers unfortunately are some of the features that create a little bit of a lull at the midpoint of the record given the concept blue is coming through with on here I can understand why he would want a bit of a rotating cast of characters around him as he is kind of progressing through this story but there are some guest verses on here that maybe come off a bit too cringy and macho or maybe a bit overly simplistic and basic lyrically but despite all that I love this record quite a bit it's a really great West Coast hip hop album and I'm excited to see blue actually lighting a fire under his ass and getting ambitious once again I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana blue Ono forever 
jto3k6kzbz0,hi everyone rest in peace Keith Flint here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Solange record when I get home this is the latest full-length album from singer and songwriter Solange Knowles a follow up to her breakthrough 2016 record a seat at the table regardless of what your opinion on her music is you have to kind of give it to Solange because for years she continued to drop music with very little fanfare in return for it she practically disappeared off the map after the drop of her 2012 EP true which featured waltz wall production from dev Hines aka blood orange and received somewhat mixed reviews Solange would spend the next several years pulling together what would be her breakthrough AHA artistic moment a seat at the table a lengthy album that was subtle on presentation but big on beauty and ideas and social commentary what Solange lacked in vocal presence on these tracks she easily made up for with smooth instrumentals and luscious atmospheres as well as songs and messages that shined despite their shy demeanor now without question this thing was one of the best records of 2016 and instantly turned Solange into a must-watch artist in the fields of R&B and neo soul so of course whatever she released next was going to drop with a splash and before we even get into the substance of this record Solange has already given us a lot to think and write about with a promotional film attached to the release of this album on production we have names like Tyler the Creator Earl panda bear dev Hines as well as Metro boomin Pharrell Steve Lacey is on here too this album also boasts features from the likes of playboy cardi as well as Santa and an gucci mane now even though when I get home is not as lengthy or as enveloping as its predecessor it is a pretty eclectic album with its constant rotation of instrumental palates and guests the way this album flows in a lot of respects actually reminds me of the recent dev Hines album the blood orange record Negro Swan in that this album presents a pretty seamless string of tracks that and sighs mood and vibe Solange seems more content here to be recording motifs and and sketches than larger and more compartmentalized songs which in theory is not necessarily a bad thing I think you can pull together a record that shoots for that style and comes out really great but truth be told there's not really a single track on this thing that I think can go toe-to-toe with one of the best cuts off of a scene at the table like cranes in the sky or don't touch my hair oddly enough for an album that runs like a tapestry of tightly woven various ideas the mix the atmosphere on this record it's not very washed out or dreamy or intoxicating a seat at the table had a pretty soft sound that you could really get lost in and while when I get home isn't exactly an explosion of emotion and color the instrumentals on this record and even Solange's voice are a lot more stark and bear in their presentation which I think could be a positive thing or a negative thing depending on who's listening to this record but for me personally Solange's meek voice often just loses me especially when she puts herself in a situation where her singing really has to carry the song her vocals on tracks like Jared as well as time is our meandering and sleep-inducing her singing on the last leg of my skin my logo serves as one of many examples on this record where her vocals just come off really pitchy very nasally I'm not even going to get into her rapping on the first leg of the track not only our Solange's volume and range on this album pretty lackluster but she's not exactly the most expressive singer either and look these were issues on her last full-length album too but with the way these songs and the production were groomed on that LP they worked around that overall when I get home is really leaving me with mixed emotions because while I'm not really impressed with Solange's execution on this LP some of the ideas or what she's shooting for on this album shows some real galaxies brain ambition I enjoy a lot of the eclectic transitions that Solange works in between these tracks there are moments on this LP where I can hear her trying to embrace some of the newest and weirdest trends in hip-hop music but apply them to like an R&B or and Neos soeul context with some of the more bare and minimal instrumentals on this thing the emphasis on repetition I think the most obvious example of this is on the song Almeida featuring playboy cardi which sounds like Solange doing her best to make her album sound like something that could be woven into the tracklist of dile it there are some other highlights on here that I like quite a bit the very groovy stay flow is great with its subtle beat switches grimy bass glistening keys and Solange's delivery on this track has this very cool laid-back tight harmonic quality to it that reminds me of like an old 90s R&B single dreams and beltway are a few of the tracks on this thing that actually worked very well despite the vocals being so spotlit the execution here is pretty beautiful and smooth and sweet especially on the song dreams with its themes of youth and aspiration I also love the fusion of drums and synth bass and chirpy vocal harmonies on the song bins the CP time bars that Solange works into this track are hilarious and one of many instances of her embracing humor on this record also a show of her personality coming a lot more through her writing than her performance but outside of that there wasn't a whole lot about this record that really stopped me in my tracks and left a huge impression on me much of the 39 minutes and 19 tracks on this thing just kind of breezes by as pleasant as it is a majority of the vibes that solange drums up on this record are pretty decent but upon closer inspection the songwriting details and the faint but quality performances just aren't really there as much as I admire some portions of this album for being pretty adventurous just kind of feels like a step back granted a lot of what Solange is taking a step back with on this album she's most likely conscious of it I guess she is just feeling confident to let it all hang out on this new LP and a lot of hardcore fans will most likely appreciate this album for that reason as Solange's artistic aesthetic and her messaging usually precede her vocal chops I'm feeling a decent 6 on this thing good jab good jab this is gonna be great I'm gonna love hearing about this review all over the internet for the next five months it's gonna be great well you know that's that's that's that's how I felt okay it's I'm sorry no no no you you're doing great your anyone fine just

1ADfOjrM97Y,ooh baby I love you a every day hi everyone Bethany Singh tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd you know what it is it is time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I

that turntable lab link if you guys want to spoil spoil yourselves with some colorful pressings of Records that we have covered and talked about on the main youtube channel we get kickback from it and let's get into the worst tracks of the week the worst worst worst worst worst tracks of the week alright first off let's kick it with this track from juice world it seems like every relevant rapper these days I thought this was gonna die in 2019 but it seems like every relevant rapper these days has to come out with some like bad dancehall influenced ballad that is that is really not that good and that would be this song for juice world over here that would be this this track over here so if you're looking to hear juice the juice world kind of riff on somewhat half-assed pop rap dancehall beat blend then give this track here me calling a shot despite this though I am still looking forward to as new malankov LP could be good could be a new level for this whole emo rap emo trap thing I guess we'll see moving on from there move and move and move and move and move and keep it and moving of course I did not really care for the new Jonas Brothers track all that much sucker it's a very bland piece of overproduced pop not a lot of flavor and personality coming out of it it's very basic it's very plain it's very average I just don't really get much out of it moving out from there not really diggin on the new AV tear cut either which is really kind of devoid of anything exciting it's it's very tedious I guess I'll say very very tedious which I do tend to find is the case with a lot of animal collectives solo material but I don't know I guess it's a to the point where it's I guess a little disheartening with this AV ter cut over here just could not really get much out of it no matter how much I tried to sit through the whole thing and read into it and and just eat up what little details there were in it alright let's move on to the tracks I thought were kind of meth not terrible but certainly worth iwere attention worth pointing in your direction you might dig in a little bit more than me first off we have this new track over here from Zachary who you might remember made a vocal appearance on kendrick lamar's damn I didn't really care for his feature I didn't really get much out of it but I thought he brought a lot more vocal heat on this new cut over here with his a buttery baby boy voice he also came through with some very interesting production and overall a decent tunes so I don't know I guess I'm kind of looking forward to what this guy's gonna be doing in the future even though my first introduction to him and his stuff didn't really care for it all that much to be honest moving on from there we have a new cut from the drums which I don't know feels like the band's old-school in D & punky energy is slipping away on this cut over here the name of the song is 6 2 6 bedford avenue it's got some playful lovey-dovey lyrics that are so saccharine that it gets kind of us turning to a point but I do kind of like the very playful and bubbly energy of the song you know the band is really going pop on this cut but not so far that it's a ruin their sound or their vibe or anything like that you know I guess just give it a try give it a shot give it a give it give it a try give it an attempt moving on from there Kara Kara Benito has a brand new cut out as well a non-album track that they have released titled the open road and I guess on this song they are kind of reflecting on exactly that and it just sort of seemed like the band is moving backwards a little bit on this cut over here while they are still very much in that indie rock and kind of twee noise pop space that they inhabited on their last full-length album the tune and the production is nowhere near as like you know sticky or as mind-blowing as it was on that record you know seems like a little a little rough this time around but hey you know Kara Kara Benito is still a pretty great band and and some piece of music from them is certainly better than no piece of music from them so can't complain too much about that moving on from there Diane coffee has a brand-new track out which feels like equal parts like futuristic synth pop but then there's also like some splashes of prints in there as well it's not bad I think maybe it didn't go far enough for me or that there were some elements of it that I found to be a little underwhelming but not ready to go is is still I think I must listen for the synth pop heads out there moving on from there there is a brand new cut from deafheaven which everybody is kind of making a huge deal out of and I mean I think it's decent the band is going in a somewhat surprising direction I mean I like that it's a change of pace from the really awful post-rock black metal I don't know what emo blends or on their last full-length record that I thought were kind of a mess this new track over here which is titled black brick is actually a pretty straightforward please sit piece of just just I don't know no no frills black metal it's just some straight old-school black metal with the chilly atmosphere production the super harsh guitar distortion the vocals don't even sound like what you would typically hear on a deafheaven track they just sound like an old-school black metal throwback aesthetically and sigh listicle e it is so paint by the numbers black metal it's kind of shocking if there's anything about the track that really stood out to me it's that it's a pretty long epic and winding black metal composition you know there are multiple phases to it a lot of them are very cool the performance is pretty ferocious but I guess it's kind of difficult again aesthetically to get a full grip of exactly what the band is trying to do this time around on just this single track because just based on sound alone it really just kind of seems like this could be an old-school black metal band playing this track or something and I guess I'll just leave it at that alright moving on from there american football does have a brand new single at every wave to ever rise featuring Elizabeth Powell sadly was not as into the single as their last one I thought the vocals were kind of underwhelming and that the song eventually grew kind of kind of kind of tedious even if the guitars are very pretty and very sparkly and uh the sad and mellow beauty of the song will most likely appeal to hardcore fans but it wasn't really doing too much for me and let's move into the tracks that I thought were the best the best this week the tracks that really kind of blew me away stuck with me left an impression on ya Bo I first off we have this brand-new cut over here from wand a band that typically dabbles in psychedelic rock that previously I was never all that into never thought their stuff was amazing but now they're really just kind of I'm just wow me with this this new strain of of tracks they've been dropping teaser tracks they've been dropping in preparation for this new record this one is a bit of a slow burner but I do like the very angular and busy layers of guitar that play throughout these somewhat mellow verses and the band eventually brings it to this amazing explosive kind of abrasive climax in the second leg which is actually kind of incredible wand record over here is definitely when I am looking forward to this year moving on from their tiara whack has a brand new cut out which is a pretty quirky it's titled clones seems almost like a very weird idea that she could have fit onto her last full-length album but she actually extended it out to like two minutes and change it's pretty fun the verses are cool the beat is super zany and her personality is off the charts on this one moving on from their Australian artist Stella Donnelly who I was not really all that well-versed in the work in prior to you being exposed to this new cut over here to be completely honest as head of tricks and it is a very jaunty and bubbly piece of indie pop with some great guitars and some very witty and clever and playful lyrics it's just a lot of fun okay it's just a really fun song you're like fun don't ya then listen to this thing all right moving on from there we have a new cut from sin Kane and artist - I was exposed to him first why I heard that record he dropped on DFA a handful of years ago and it didn't really do all that much for me but he's got a brand new single over here titled to everybody which sounds very much unlike the music from him that I've heard in the past and it's it's kind of a refreshing mix of rock and roll and psych rock and afro beat music and protest music it's got some great group vocals on a fantastic energy I just kind of love the revolutionary vibe of the track quite a bit definitely gonna be looking forward to his next record if he's got more tracks coming down the pipe like this moving out from there show me the body has a brand new raw punky and off-the-wall track over here show me the body always has a very our way of embracing a lot of tenants of punk music while simultaneously working in a lot of weird experimental bits that just kind of make their sound very odd and kind of unique Madonna rocket is the name of this new cut over here the band pup also has a brand new track out which in my opinion may be their best single to date honestly even with some of the great singles off of their last full length album free at last is the name of this new one pay special attention to the kind of self defeatist lyrics the punk energy of the track is fantastic the guitars are kind of wild and super catchy love it quite a bit moving on from there this is a group that previously I had not known about they have a new record or at least they're coming out with music via father/daughter records and the name of this group is partner and this track is tell you off and it is a very tongue-in-cheek silly piece of hipster country with some great vocals hilarious lyrics funny lyrics funny funny lyrics and I'm just like a nod premise to the tune telling someone off which is a kind of badass I guess it's very it's a very mean tune mean and spirit and mean in terms of I don't know I guess it's enjoyability alright moving on from there Matt mos has released two songs and music videos this week breaking bread and also thermoplastic riot shield if you know anything about the duo and their eclectic sample style and they're very busy and dense approach to electronic music you will get a lot out of these two new tracks I am absolutely excited for this plastic anniversary album coming out very soon hype hype hype hype hype moving on from there we have a brand new single as well from just shuffle Stein and Pharrell Williams liking this single a lot more than the one he did with the weekend frankly the tunas great Pharrell's energy and vocals are on point and the production is very groovy and hard-hitting maybe not as dark and as gritty as the other stuff that I enjoy from from Christoffel Stein in the past you know I just say his name silly because I'm a silly man I apologize maybe not as hard-hitting or as gritty as the stuff from him that I've heard in the past but still pretty good still pretty sick moving on from there four tet has a brand new single out it's actually one of his most riveting singles in a long time the title of it is only human it's got a great groove fantastic beats these wonderful group vocal samples of what sounds like a group of kids or singers just chanting or singing in unison almost in like a ritualistic fashion it's a pretty exciting and I love it quite a bit the vibe the energy of the song is amazing moving on from there folks have a brand new single out which is a kind of a slow burner for the first leg and then it explodes into a pretty incredible and somewhat experimental poppy display in the latter half that I think is pretty great definitely hype for this new foals record when it does drop carly rae jepsen yes the Carly is back with two new singles look Carly's last single I thought was okay came with a very quirky and the sexual music video was fun it was tongue-in-cheek but the tune to me really just kind of fell flat of these two new tracks in my opinion these two new new new tracks now that I found you and no drug like me are sexy they have great production it's very bright it's very punchy maybe not as throwback and as synth-pop inspired as emotion was which a lot of people love that record I like that record quite a bit also love you know the emotion extras to a lot of people living and dying by that album and yes that is that a kind of dying off it sounds like with this record with these new tracks but the tunes that the core of these cuts are still really good it's it's quality dance pop I can't really complain about it too much it's still very fun still very bubbly it's not over produced to the point where it's got no flavor or anything like that yeah it's it's just quite catchy sweet and enjoyable and that's really all I got to say about it moving on from there oh no and blue have come together on to a new record that just dropped this week I want to turn you guys onto this track over here that is linked down below in the description box along with all these other ones pop shots I'm not going to say too much about it because I do want to talk about this record sooner rather than later and it's it's very enjoyable in my opinion Blue has not sounded this this Hungary on a track on a record for quite a long time and his pairing with Ono is really just kind of a match made in heaven alright moving on from there a big thief a group that previously I was not all that huge into have come through with a very smart and interesting song in sound and in concept you FoF pay special attention to the lyrics on this track because you know not a lot of groups especially of this style write songs about I guess the extra-terrestrial which at least seems to be inspired by in a very creative in an interesting way but also I love the subtle beauty of this track quite a bit as well and I I guess I'll just leave it at that it's a very slow burning quiet beautiful tune with some almost like mystical qualities to it and I think the the the lyrics the concept of the the lyrics elevates that quite a bit moving on from there I think this is our last one I want to give a shout out to a baby mother for this new track over here dragon which is just kind of a straight display of bars on bars on bars and bars on bars which are pretty great and she just has a great energy on this this it seems like almost like a freestyle in a way has a great energy on the track her flow is just relentless and non-stop it's actually pretty impressive how long and just like hard she goes on this track definitely gonna be looking for more material from her in the future based off of this performance alone and we were going to leave it at that that has been our weekly track round up everybody thank you very much for watching also link down there below which I did not mention earlier I do want to say am doing a tour on

pUfd5iCEX6w,ah I'm such a sexy boy hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for another edition of great albums where I go over a series of records from the past month or so that blew me away impressed me thought they were noteworthy so I assemble them into this video so you do not miss out on them you do not let them slip through the cracks please okay alright let's let's let's go let's start a listing one want to give a shout out to the latest Marquis Hill record modern flows vol 2 I know this is not a 20-19 album came out very very very late last year and eventually caught up to it early this year it is a great fusion of jazz and hip-hop and funk and soul just a quality record all around few tracks here and there that are maybe a little underwhelming but a fantastic contribution to the modern jazz feel do not miss out on this record it is passionate it is classy it is colorful it is well performed some of the performances have a quite a bit of bite but generally it is it is a very subtle gorgeous little jazz album also want to give a shout out to the latest records from James Blake and Sharon Van Etten's while these two albums did not end up on my loved list I do think these are two of the best records from these artists so far James Blake coming through with some forward-thinking production a few risks that didn't pan out but mostly very beautiful ballads one track after the next and very much the same situation for Sharon Van Etten's she took a lot of risks on this new LP which mostly panned out worked in a lot more synths and some grander more layered production this time around not every tune on this thing wowed me but if you're looking for a quality singer-songwriter record in the first leg of this year do not miss out on this record next the new collaborative LP from Aesop Rock and tobacco of black moths super rainbow fame under the name Malibu Ken while they don't really change up all that much in their respective styles to converge on to this new album Aesop rocks usual style his lyrical style as flow is very much unchanged tobacco's typically funky and hip-hop and fuzzy and trippy production style is pretty much unchanged the south my guess is a show of how well these two work together just I I guess in their own natural states the production is grimy and surreal and colorful and certainly lends a lot of character to Aesop's very grimy and personal and wordy versus a super weird left-field abstract hip-hop album with a lot of personality it's a little brief and I wouldn't call it ambitious or anything like that but it's still a very quality album next a shout out to the new ariana grande album thank you next essentially my pop record of the year so far this year definitely a more personal and a more aesthetically consistent effort than her last full-length album definitely seemed a lot less formulaic and focus-grouped even though there are some really trendy and amazing bangers on this thing the way this records been dominating the charts as well I think is incredibly indicative of its quality and Ariana Grande comes through some really compelling lyrics and and songs on this thing getting to the heart of some very vulnerable and introspective themes while also penning songs that are meant to appeal to a pop audience I just love it it's very fun it's very catchy but also incredibly sad - next is easily my favorite album of the year so far the most harrowing and cutting-edge and wild listening experience that I have had in 2019 at this point and that is the new Shu Shu record girl with basket of fruit the see of chaotic percussion on this thing is not only new exciting ground for Shu Shu but in the grander scheme of experimental music absolutely exciting and mind-blowing meanwhile on top of this Jamie Stewart lays down some of the most exciting thrilling and strange vocal performances within the entire Shu Shu discography and Jamie is not exactly a performer known for playing it safe this album is so bold and out there I actually have a hard time maybe recommending it very hard because I think this thing is going to turn off a lot of people this album is very much not going to be for everybody this is the kind of record that is definitely going to turn some listeners away right within like the first thirty Seconds but Shu Shu is most likely already very conscious of this if you are into totally left-field and challenging experimental music that is absolutely harrowing if you're a big fan of things like Captain Beefheart or even the pop group this will absolutely be right up your alley and also shout out to Jamie and company for coming together with the amazing roster of guest vocalists and musicians on this record - who add a lot of character and flavor to the cell pian and make it something truly special and finally in my recommendations list here I want to give a big shout out to a great compilation that just dropped through light in the Attic records kakyoin gaku japanese ambient environmental and new age music 1980 to 1990 this is a blissful amazing colorful bold and inspiring set of tracks from across the ambient spectrum the atmospheres on this thing are pristine and I love the range of flavours showcased on this compilation tracks that are droney tracks that are incredibly spacious and minimal tracks that are more dense tracks that have a more contemporary and synthetic sound other cuts that take on elements of Japanese traditional music but whatever the flavor or the angle of a particular composition or the artists creating it it all fits very snugly into this very wonderful and ambient box not only is it great to be handed in ambient compilation where all the tracks are so quality and each has their own bold and distinct personality but I'm also amazed at how well this collection of tracks highlights and amplifies this wing of ambient music this era this niche of ambient music it's history that often goes overlooked and I am going to leave it at that hopefully you guys got some good recommendations out of this video of reviews and links and all that stuff down in the d box transition have you given these items a listen you're the best through the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a nother video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana music recommendations great albums of forever

1980 to 1990 this is a new compilation out via light in the Attic records a mega varied label out of Seattle that has been releasing albums and singles and comps for years from across the music spectrum and this latest compilation from them sees the catalogue expanding into a very interesting direction just as the title suggests Japanese ambient music from 1980 to 1990 so why this review why Japan why this time period why this genre of music well I could tell you that experimental composers from the East reacted pretty boldly to the inception of ambien one and expanded on the ideas from that record not only with new technologies but also by embracing Japan's own rich history with freeform and meditative music and hearing that history come together with new technology under this burgeoning wave of sonic art it led to a pretty fertile first decade for this environmental music really what's brought me here is this compilation was recommended to me by a viewer and I tried it and it was flames ambient flames while I don't review a whole lot of New Age and ambient music on my channel I do have somewhat of a hushed love for it but I I think I'm just kind of picky when it comes to the genre generally the mood has to be right and the sounds have to have character and while stillness and repetition are not necessarily bad things I don't want to feel trapped in someone's ocean of uninspired crap in the past the godfather of what's been commercially termed as ambient music has likened the style to furniture or background enhancement and even if this style of music is meant to hang in the background is essentially wallpaper but make no mistake ambient music is or at least should be intended to have some kind of effect on the listener even if it is a subtle or a subconscious one because background music can be inspiring if it influences your mental state in the right way and I think that's what this very tight compilation of tracks achieves there there's nothing on the abridged digital version of this compilation that expands past seven minutes but despite the relative brevity of many of these pieces they all pretty much come through with some very bold and memorable sound palates so bold I think some of these pieces may actually hook in newbies to ambient music or even listeners who might consider themselves be a bit too impatient for this style of music there are 10 different tracks on this thing from 10 different artists they all flow together pretty nicely whether you're talking about more synthetic pieces on this thing like glass shattering from Yoshio Jima the track gives me the sensation of floating in an icy palace and I'm just surrounded by all of these bright rays of light reflecting off frozen sheets of water then there are pieces on this thing that feature more live instrumentation more organic instrumentation like the song ear dreamin which definitely lives up to its title it is completely e orgasmic song features this panoramic layout of all these plucky metallic tones and what sounds like some chime e bells and all of its performed in this very loose and intimate and primal circle of pure bliss tradition meets the new-age on this track with some of the ethereal and bright gorgeous droney scent tones swelling in the background behind all this instrumentation it's just a wonderful marriage of new and old and sounds totally refreshing despite how old it is at this point there are other pieces on this thing that are incredibly minimal and pensive like the opening cut still space from Satoshi Ishikawa which features these very polite and gentle synth notes popping and swelling at a very loose in a very slow pace it's progressing so slowly and so loosely that you have to kind of relax and zone out and process it in real time because there's no strong rhythm kind of packing the melodies and the chords into an easy to decipher pattern the old-school synth tones on this track are lovely and as far as keyboard pieces on this thing go it is only rivaled by Hiroshi Yoshi morose blink which has this wonderfully sad Beauty to it even though the keys on this cut are very soft and very subtle the emotional impact for me was devastating continuing on the minimal of this album there is the abridged version of Ashura which is this very open and spacious Bell piece that at point seems to value silence more than sound and it also does not take long for the compilation to literally start throwing ocean sounds at listeners V song variation 3/4 an ambient piece I wouldn't exactly call it pleasant the constantly wishing waves on this track have a subtly harsh quality to them and as the song progresses the synthesizers take on an almost dystopian feel the constantly wishing waves on this track or may be a little harsh and the song is also littered with these almost unpredictable shots of percussion and chimes which prevents the atmosphere of the song from really relaxing or settling down there's also these kind of distant and dark synth tones that have a strange chorus effect or a phaser effect on them they sound like an old-school conception of postmodern sound almost like I'm listening to vaporwave sans internet culture the water theme continues on the track praying for mothers / earth volume 1 which gives listeners more of a babbling brook experience set against synthesizers that get progressively more and more dystopian as they continue in a way it kind of reminds me of like a Tim Hecker song or a Boards of Canada track these songs see the light is one of the few tracks on the abridged version of this compilation that has a truly droney quality to it it's almost Vangelis Esquith it's very hopeful and meandering lead synth melodies playing over these cycling tones that are very relaxing and almost like mind-numbing overall this is a stunningly beautiful collection of old-school ambient music from an era and from a location that clearly has not gotten enough shine up until this point I think there are maybe a few pieces here that aren't given full justice in their abridged versions meanwhile the song sea echo 3 which I hope I'm pronouncing correctly is probably the biggest cliffhanger of a song in ambient music compilation will ever hand me it is just way too amazing to end at the point that it does but what are you gonna do I'm really impressed with this collection it is amazing what light in the Attic has dug up here and I am feeling a decent - a strong 8 on this thing transition have you given this compilation - listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here

EerTWrLqowA,aye-aye-aye aye-aye-aye hi everyone melon crush Monday here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new offset record father of four this is the debut full-length solo album of cardi B's Bey one third of the Atlanta rap trio migos father for offset over the past year so the Atlanta trio has been cashing out on their popularity by doing some extra curricular records with collaborative projects like Travis Scott's & Cuevas honcho Jack Jack honcho also the surprisingly decent without warning with 21 savage and offset himself a very dark and gritty collection of low-key trap bangers all produced by Metro boomin last year take off himself dropped his own incredibly rushed solo album that not many people took to I can barely even remember it at this point then came Cuevas quavo honcho which was star-studded and pretty well produced but quavo himself demanded the least attention across the entire LP his lyrics his bars were pretty forgettable and he took a bunch of weird risks on tracks and sounds that didn't really complement his style and now we have father of four which miraculously is the best of the trios solo efforts at least in this first round of them anyway because maybe there will be more in the future and father of four isn't the best of the meego solo record so far just by virtue of not being total trash it's actually a pretty mellow somewhat consistent and personal album a record that kind of allows you to view offset outside of the context of migos entirely I'm actually pretty surprised how listenable this album came out especially given public perception of me goes in the past as far as who the best member of the group was going back to 2016 when I asked thousands of my Twitter followers who the Beyonce of migos was far and away the choice was quavo and it's kind of easy to see why that may be the choice for many on a good MeeGo single Cuevas voice usually stands out the most has the most character he's just got this really distinct kind of nasally kind of raspy voice that fits in a range that just pops in the mix and to be honest offsets voice is usually what sticks out the least and amigos song especially since takeoff vocals are usually the deepest raspy stand heaviest given all of this it's kind of weird to realize that it's offset who all this time had the most solo potential all of these comparisons are relative though because is having the most solo potential within me goes translate to having enough solo potential to sustain a long-term solo career most likely no but I guess this record does serve as final confirmation that migos truly are bigger than the sum of their parts because listening to even the best of the solo album so far it still kind of feels like you're listening to me goes in a diminished capacity still it does seem like offset put the most heart and forethought and effort into this record going into his relationship with cardi his personal connections or lack thereof with his own kids dropping an occasional bar about racial injustice or societal ills his family has passed his upbringing there are tracks on this thing like the intro featuring big rube definitely getting some big outcast vibes off of this one we're offset seems to be baring his soul a little bit honestly he's also rapping in a somewhat different delivery than we are used to sure at the very start of his performance on the song he does sound a little like Travis Scott but when he does gain his bearings his voice doesn't have the usual put on that you hear when he appears on a migos track it just sounds like he's not trying to be anything other than himself the moments on this record were offset tries to go deeper and more substantive they are admirable not just the opening track but also the closing track the song how did I get here featuring J Cole also the track Luke we're off set says think about my history back of the bus fought for the rights but we still killed us for offset it's a pretty nice change of pace definitely highlights on this record but in the grander scheme of things do these tracks blow me away not necessarily a lot of the societal observations offset makes on tracks like these they're kind of surface very general it's not like he's really turning a new leaf or anything and it doesn't take long on this record for offset to start dropping tracks that essentially just sound like Mego songs but with just him and maybe with a bit more reverb and instrumentals that take on a more mystical angle tatts on my face made men tracks that again sound like a typical MIGO song but with the dramatic atmosphere of ASAP Ferg's trap Lord I don't think the record picks up again until the song North Star where CeeLo Green's guest vocals really steal the show they are one of the most gorgeous highlights on the entire record the production on this track is actually pretty stunning too they both do a great job of enhancing the drama of offsets very lonely and paranoid bars which given the pretty underwhelming delivery he has throughout most of this record they are in need of enhancing there are some spots like after dark where offsets voice gets a bit bolder and more authoritative his opening verse on this cut is relatively poetic like he almost knows he's saying something of a bit more substance here something that he might have really worked on that's definitely a highlight and we have another track that has been very talked about from this record don't lose me which is essentially offsets public apology to cardi about not being a good husband being unfaithful and honestly it's it's no 4:44 the lyrics of the track feel more general than confessional but it does sound like the instrumental samples of cricket and that's kind of weird but okay there are also a lot of big features on the back end of this record that I hoped would pick up the momentum of the album but many of them don't legacy with Travis Scott and 21 Savage should have been amazing really should have been a blockbuster of a track but is more of a dud mostly because it doesn't really seem like there's much rhyme or reason as to how the song features its guests sure the instrumental is kind of pretty but offset and Travis constantly trading places and bars in the first leg of the song really does no justice for either of them it's kind of like they just cancel each other out meanwhile 21 savage appears with no real intro no real build-up or anything like that and he disappears just as quickly as he came I feel like everybody was doing their best on this track but the way all the vocals and performances were organized and presented it just feels like a traffic jam almost like that Kodak black song is easy but worse the quavo and Gucci appearances on this thing are nothing to write home about even if some of Gucci's ad-libs the background are pretty animated kardi be easily walks away with the best wrapped feature on this entire record sorry J Cole she brings the most energy the most hilarious bars and arguably does a better job focusing on the topic of the song than offset does chasing after clout and unfortunately offset doesn't really have anything all that poignant or memorable to say on the topic the song red room one of the lead singles to this record is a perfect example of offsets shortcomings as a solo artist because even though he's putting a lot of his own personal story into this record and he tries to run this track as if it's like an emotional diatribe or a monologue it's still kind of underwhelming not really that strong of a hook or a tune to it and offsets delivery from front to back is bland and unmemorable doesn't really leave much of an impression at all and the track just completely ends out of nowhere and somehow goes on way too long I do think the track came a long way does end things off on a somewhat high note but the ride up until this point does make it kind of hard to celebrate I don't know man I'm a little torn on this one it's certainly a listenable album it is Pleasant has a handful of highlights only a few tracks that I thought were supremely lackluster while there are some characteristics that I find very underwhelming the production is pretty great offset does pull together a handful of very good songs and given the previous to me goes solo albums that definitely surpassed my expectations I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you

p3mUwEc4yow,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new CEO space cowboy album or rather compilation songs for the firing squad this is a new comp of tracks from a band that formed around 2016 hailing from San Diego pulling together tracks they dropped on a debut EP a split they put out last year a 2017 single and more the material on this thing might not be fresh fresh fresh fresh fresh but it has mostly flown under the radar for pretty much everybody up until this point and now the band has the opportunity to release these tracks through pure noise records a versatile and somewhat popular underground rock label hailing from the west coast that's been platforming everything from emo to metalcore dropping new records from groups like census fall and drug Church as well as counterparts and even a new EP from less than Jake less than Jake but even given the versatility of the labels roster so far this compilation is not really something that I saw coming as I thought the style of music dis band plays pretty much died out with the 2000s Seve space cowboy performs this really fast spastic abrasive brand of mathematic metalcore that I actually used to dig quite a bit from the likes of an albatross and early albums from the locust as well as early records from daughters the sound the trend the style it never really took on one single shape you had groups within it that were more metalcore and grindcore influenced then you had others that gained a lot more inspiration from things like post-hardcore and noise rock see you space cowboy though sits at a crossroads where just about every abrasive style of underground rock prevalent in the 2000s leave some kind of impact on what they're doing here there are even shades of screamo on this thing which the band hilariously acknowledges with the title of the fourth track stop calling a scream oh the 18 minutes this compilation lasts is spread across 13 tracks which obviously does not leave a whole lot of runtime to each song on this record so the band is hitting listeners with a lot of riffs and breakdowns and grooves and noise and transitions at a very fast pace heavy fierce gargantuan chugging core Birds some weird sour odd angular guitar passages as well blasts beat drums guttural growls and throat shredding screams I'll make up the countless changes across this very short span of time and even though a lot of the tracks on this thing are limited to one minute and change the group comes through with some pretty memorable compositions and ideas like the raging mosh pit of Sour blazing chords the band blast through on the intro track here or the very Titan kind of danceable post-hardcore drums and guitars at the start of self-help specialists kind of sticky the kind of sour and off-kilter guitar leads on these songs stop calling a scream Oh feel almost post punky then there's the powerfully abrasive and freakish noisy guitar chords on the third track of this thing some parts of which almost give the noisiest and most gruesome bits throughout the converge discography a run for their money there's also a kind of demented breakdown toward the end of the track that's absolutely hilarious this compilation is like a relentless roller coaster of extreme versions of aggression and humor and absurdity especially if you read through the lyrics and especially with laughs through the pain song titles like pep talk from a nihilist Jimmy Buffett doesn't even sir I am a Transcontinental Railroad please run a train on me and one of my favorite tracks on this thing that references a Trailer Park Boys episode you don't understand the liquor is calling the shots now Randy bo-bandy when it comes to this very fast abrasive busy ever evolving and changing brand of very mathy metalcore I wouldn't say see you space cowboy is reinventing the wheel or anything but it is done incredibly well the performances on this thing are super tight the production is very vibrant and heavy and fantastic I would say going forward though why not more versatility why not more risks why not more layers why not more sticky memorable melodic bits because I do feel like the compilation even though it is a bunch of songs pulled from various sources toward the end of it was definitely running thin on new ideas even with the very sweet and shouty and refreshing pop punk transition on the track fashion statements I think the vocals could be doing a bit more to come off a bit more intelligible or even distinct still though this is a pretty fantastic collection of tracks that has me looking forward to hearing what this band is going to be doing in the future it is a very sweet little Skull Crushing and fun compilation of very abrasive rock music I'm feeling a light 7 on this thing transition have you given this thing a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to

wgU7-FzF5Xw,hi everyone to me Tana here are the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new gonna project drip or drown - this is the latest full-length album from Georgia rapper and singer gonna who of course is featured on young thug was a young stoner life records and gonna if you have not been paying attention has been having a pretty big past couple of years with the thugger cosign his breakout drip season 3 tape and the very viral drip harder project he put out with little baby last year however with tuning in to nearly every major gonna feature and single and project that has dropped over the last year or so I'm really just kind of confused as to what his appeal is in fact I would say I struggle with seeing that appeal and I like and listen to and review a lot of trap rap and even when I'm not crazy about a particular artists like a Kodak black for example I can at least see what he brings to the table or what he does that might appeal to other people but with gonna consistently I just see his tunes as forgettable the beats he picks are super average easily he has one of the least distinct voices in rap music right now if you had a gun to my head and forced me to pick him out of a lineup that would be my death his flows aren't anything special in the grander scheme of the genre and most of what he does is painfully derivative of the artists who helped put him on in the first place I just see his whole existence as redundant will it be that way down the road I don't know artists always change and grow and expand and try different things but as of right now that's pretty much how I see it and keep in mind these are all the feelings I already had going into listening to this new album and unfortunately I can't say drip or drown to has really changed my mind the one thing I can give this album is that for the first leg it's got a consistently wavy and psychedelic vibe coming off of the instrumentals and it seems like gonna has a pretty focused aesthetic in mind it is very watery a lot of the instrumentals give you the sensation of being submerged in the and you're slowly falling into this wet salty abyss the vocals may not be anything to write home about but gonna at least doesn't get in the way of great instrumentals like on the track outstanding which for all intents and purposes do kind of sell the song that is enough to make the first leg of this album for the most part pretty relaxing and listenable and keep in mind I'm just saying this section of the album is listenable it's not mind-blowing or anything like that but it only takes till about the little baby feature on this album for not only this record to take a nosedive but for gonna to completely lose sight of this aquatic vibe he's drummed up and then he just essentially transitions into mega formulaic auto-tune trap rap with no charisma no passion no soul no nothing so lifeless it's so mind-numbing it's so devoid of anything interesting or memorable pretty much just like the drip hardier project but just with one of the two voices that that album contained lyrically I didn't go into this album expecting that much but a lot of the time it seems like gonna is trying as hard as he can to do as little as possible without seeming like he's doing nothing I don't mind minimal trap tracks with maybe a funny or an odd or an outlandish delivery that's exactly why I enjoy playboy cardi's die lit drip or drown in a lot of ways is essentially that but you have to subtract the creative and alternative production the character the flavor and also the memorability but unfortunately cardi can't even save the track that he appears on on this thing so yeah eventually on this album the lyrics devolve into total drivel look at the song speeded up eventually the beats fall off as well like the nasty delayed cyclical lo-fi guitars on the track big shot which are not very listenable at all or the bland country trap fusion on the track on a mountain which sounds pretty much like a ripoff of exactly what young thug did on beautiful thugger girls yet another example of gonna living in Fugger shadow not to mention that he is overshadowed by young thug on the track that thug appears on because vocally gonna mimics thugger obviously and yet his singing pales in comparison in every conceivable way also the beat on the track who you foolin is so plain and basic that it's almost insulting the hi-hats don't even sound eacute or mixed into the instrumental it's like the producers on this thing gave up at a certain point to this album pretty much feels like nearly everyone involved just phoning it in as much as possible which is unfortunate because this record is probably going to get a lot of play a lot of exposure a lot of attention and I would like to think that anybody involved with a record with this much exposure would do everything they can to sound as great as possible in this moment where they are most likely going to be given access to a piece of the limelight for a very short amount of time even artists who make classic records and are incredibly talented don't maintain their peak of popularity forever and given that what hopes does this record or gonna have because it sounds like he's really not trying at all and just doing the barest of minimums to fit snugly into a very trendy sound at this moment I'm feeling a light too on this thing transition have you given this thing a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like feel like please subscribe please don't cry over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that upworthy link to subscribe to the channel Anthony

IfasBW89k1Q,Harvard dropout anything Westen attends a cop-out Harvard dropout hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new little pomp album Harvard dropout this is the newest album from Florida rapper Gazi Garcia aka little pump who has been keeping us waiting for a pretty long year to hear this record that he has been teasing for quite a while to the point where the meme this album's title is based off of his kind of grown stale at this point but still I am pretty excited to hear new material from pump mostly because I was looking forward to hearing the next phase of evolution from him after his 2017 self-titled project which I still get flack for enjoying to this day mostly because it's dumb pill popping trap rap with loud beats and super basic flows is it flawed yes and is it incredibly stupid yes but this record has a raw messy wild out-of-control attitude that I just can't get enough of the over-the-top energy this project brought to the table went mostly unmatched in 2017 so again I enjoyed that 2017 record and given that little pump doesn't exactly strike me as the type to overthink anything I assumed going into his next record he'd pretty much maintain everything that made him appealing to begin with if it's not broken don't fix it but unfortunately that's just not really the case and Harvard dropout kind of stinks mostly for the exact reasons I feared after hearing one of the teaser tracks to this record racks on racks it was too slick too well produced too clean seemed like pump was putting a little bit too much effort into it in the grander scheme of things dropout isn't as much of a fumble as other new rappers have had transitioning into the mainstream and into a bigger budget and a major label deal like little yachty with his awful teenage emotions record but to a degree Harvard dropout still feels like an example of that with the much cleaner presentation stripping away the rough and authentic appeal of an amateur who somehow hit the beats on this thing are more pristine and slightly toned-down in terms of bass and distortion and aggression I wouldn't exactly call this record and mellow but the bangers on this thing are kind of mild and all the tracks on this thing that features super strip back skeletal beats those aren't really doing much for pump style either I hate to emphasize the quality of the production so much in this review but the thing is half the time the beat is carrying little pump and if the beats aren't great if they don't have an explosive energy to them there's almost no reason to listen there are maybe a handful of tracks on this thing where pump is being his usual outlandish self like Anna and reverb room and off-white white but these songs are few and far between on the album and not enough to keep the entire record afloat also what's with the numerous tracks on this thing where pump is kind of rapping well and even a bit faster than usual except he's not really that great at it and sounding slick and rapping fast is not really a part of little pumps appeal I would much rather hear him on a record sounding young and exuberant and funny and weird saying something totally absurd or something with a lot of attitude maybe even nihilistic but sounding skillful and sounding sly at least for me those are words that just don't really compute when it comes to little pump there are numerous tracks on this thing where pump in my opinion is just trying way too hard to sound put together I'll drop out on I own racks on racks also drug-addicts which despite its title sounds like one of the most sober songs on the entire record there are a couple of moments here where i think the increased budget and cleanliness actually improves little pumps formula like on the track multi-million f featuring little izzy and also of course the the song that is titled after his flagship catchphrase ass gutter those tracks are very catchy and have an incredibly high impact but honestly a majority of this album is either just straight obnoxious or painfully forgettable totally failing to recreate that same part brain-dead part aggressive thrill of many tracks off the debut honestly there's not a single song on this record that goes as hard as DeRose or even boss walk in the chat like a boss oh and that's just facts i think the closest this album comes to creating that same energy is the very blown out too much ice but even that pales in comparison and the quavo feature on that thing is incredibly average the song be like me is one of the worst little lame features he's done in a while also pumps lyrics on this track I just cannot stand there just really conceited and pretentious it's like the most annoying flex of all time because anybody who has a few brain cells to rub together really doesn't want to be little pump I mean I like a lot of your music and I like that you're doing your thing and I like your existence but I have no interest in switching places and I think that's the case for a lot of people the song stripper name is a total mess totally annoying hook also features one of the worst instrumentals on the entire thing based mostly around this very stale vocal sample again it's another example of a very minimal instrumental not doing much for pump in his style the song who dat is basically a pointless ending to this entire record I wish that pump just sort of left this thing off on a high note with ask edit the song butterfly doors the flows on that track just feel like a migos ripoff and I love it with Kanye I'm actually very happy that this song landed on this album instead of a kanye album last year I thought the music video and a lot of the memes branching off of the song were pretty cool but just by itself listening to it on an album yeah it's kind of annoying not really that good and I would be utterly embarrassed to be blasting this song in any public place all in all this is just a supremely underwhelming album from pump where the bangers where's the excitement it's not here and it's not even that pump can't rap well or that his lyrics are dumb he's a mumble rapper his bars aren't meaningful they're not substantive he's not an experimental lyrical miracle spherical miracle if those are your problems with pump you've never liked pump and why do you even have any interest in this album the problem now is that he's just gotten boring he's effectively painted himself into a corner and has kind of run out of ideas and has no choice left but to just make his music sound slicker and more expensive and surely that's going to appeal to some people but to anyone who enjoyed the debut tape for its raw energy and almost punkish attitude on Harvard dropout yeah that's completely gone I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out

h292w7beZ-0,hi hi hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for our weekly track roundup where i go over what i felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week

and a turntable lab associate links which are down there in the description box as well use them to buy some stuff you were gonna buy anyway or on that turntable add link it's some colorful pressings of vinyl that we have covered on the needle drop channel treat yourself because we get kickback from it and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the worst tracks of the week not too many this week as it seemed pretty decent chill laid-back week we have a brand new single from John Mayer which I can't really describe as anything other than super bland boring faux country balladry that is so incredibly sleepy I can't really find anything redeeming or interesting about it and also Albert Hammond Jr of The Strokes Fame can't seem to write a song post strokes that doesn't sound like a boring watered down version of The Strokes with his new single fast times alright let's get into the tracks that I thought were kind of meh not really crazy about them but certainly worth shouting out and mentioning first off we have a brand new single from Weezer they actually dropped two tracks this week the other track they dropped actually made it into the best section and we will talk about that later but this particular cut that I put over here and the mess section is the song living in LA which I thought was a pretty average piece of pop rock without a whole lot of flavor to the instrumentation the pacing of the track just seemed very stale and static and I think they could have done a lot to uh to bring more to bring more character to this song frankly with this next cut we have a new song from the Australian band the merlocks it seems like a pretty nice throwback to some 60s and 70s rock ballad jury but with some quirky and very dark and disturbing lyrics it feels nostalgic but it also feels incredibly incredibly weird moving on from there we have this brand new cut from the group teen who are pretty well known for their quirky instrumentation and they're very colorful layers of vocal harmonies but this is more of a tone down cut from the group more of a ballad more of a slow burner didn't blow me away at first listen or anything but maybe I see it as more of a song that will warm up to me as I hear the entire record again didn't really stand out to be didn't seem as bold and as full of character as teens work usually is but again those beautiful vocal harmonies and some of the angular guitar work is here so I you know it's it's just kind of like a mellower version the group that we've enjoyed up until this point moving on from there Stephen Malkmus has a brand new single out miraculously it does not sound like the weird synth electro Odyssey that his last single was this one over here is a lot more toned down it's titled rushing the acid frat sort of seems like the same kind of slacker indie rock ballad wreath at we know him for not to say that I think he should continue to do the same thing over and over and over and over but it certainly is a better executed than the last track that he dropped moving out from there the band priests the art Rock and post punk outfit priests whose previous record I didn't really care for as much as many critics did have come through with a new very well produced and incredibly dense and wordy new song that I think is pretty great titled goodtime Charlie a lot of political and social commentary packed throughout the track moving on from there Johnny Marr of the Smiths Fame has a brand new cut out the title track or rather of the the name of this new single is arm Autopia and it's it's got a nice jangle II but also synth poppy vibe to it that is is quite nice not blown away by the songwriting or anything like that but it's it's a pleasant single it's a pleasant track to have on moving out from there Jay Rock has a brand new cut out which seems like a very low-key and almost forlorn take on you know that Bay Area hip hop sound it's not bad it's very slick it's slightly over produced not too crazy about its title the other side has a few nice guests on it sadly j-rock just continues to underwhelm me I just cannot I don't know yet is crazy about his stuff is as many other people out there are you know I wish I was but I just can't find myself in that spot sadly moving on from there we have this track from this group who goes by the name of Hoover triple I or three not exactly sure how to say or pronounce their name but they do have this new single up on Bandcamp which is pretty catchy kind of linear kind of psychedelic in some spots reminds me of and some spots reminds me of king gizzard and the lizard wizard is if that is your vibe if that is your sound then I would highly recommend that you give this tract a shot moving on from there we have this new track from a group that I'm also just recently hearing about by the name of guards and it is a very lavish and well orchestrated piece of just kind of old-school pop song balladry it's very well produced and put together Last Stand is the name of the song with just the wonderful instrumentation on this track alone this this project is showing an incredible amount of promise moving on from their car seat headrest has dropped a Monkees cover that is linked down there below which is pretty decent it's of the song for pete's sake and Alex Leahy Australian singer-songwriter Alex Lahey has come through with a brand new cut as well don't be so hard on yourself it is a sweet little piece of pop rock with a pretty funny and silly music video I've never been super crazy about her tunes is sometimes I do find her writing or the instrumentation around it to be a little average or bland or straightforward but you know what she you know she's on that normal Pokemon wave you know what I mean and no crazy bells or whistles or anything like that just a straightforward song with a lot of heart a lot of emotion a personal angle coming through the lyrics you know if you like your singer songwriters to be no frills no BS I think Alex Leahy is the artist for you alright let's move on to the tracks that I thought were best tracks favourite tracks this week but BAM you guys saw it coming another thought to Jana remix is down there in the description box and young mas is is no slouch it's a very fun tatiana remix and i think that we are going to just be covering thought tiana remixes from here to kingdom come alright moving on from there we xur as i said earlier in the video came out with another single this week this is this being a different one not the living in LA one this one is excuse me titled high as a kite and it is a very sad depressing piano song with some pretty great lyrics so seems like a little personal than normal considering the rivers weird flow chart you know excel file piecing together a way of songwriting these days it's a very powerfully sad track and it's attached to a pretty great music video that reminds me of like Weezer in the old days so shout out to Weezer shout out to Weezer alright moving on from there we have also a cut over here from UK hip hop group I hope I don't say their name wrong the bar the bar and Bella in is they named this new cut over here it is a very well produced piece of UK hip hop with a great beat very colourful very forward-thinking some great flows a lot of personality coming through on the rapping and the lyrics definitely looking forward to hearing more material from these guys moving on from there we have teairra whack who has a brand new cut out titled only child I gave a full-length review of it over on the Fantana channel I love how basic and super catchy and emotional and powerful this cut is it's simple but it's got a lot of heart to it and of course given that it is tiara whack it's got a lot of weird personality to it too moving on from there we have a brand new cut from slo-mo as well a great quality piece of beat music with a lot of flavor a lot of layers and a lot of quirk but it's quite serious as well Riko nasty sandy is the name of her new banger over here attached to a very funny music video filled with awful memes and cursed images her vocals and her lyrics are as savage and as hard-hitting as ever kenny beats of course is on production and that means it's gonna be super grimy moving on from their primitive man has put out a brand new split with the band hell they have attached to absolutely disgusting songs to it this one that i chose is called oily tears sounds like a noise metal doom metal hellscape do not miss it also matt MOS have come through with the title track of their brand new album plastic anniversary I'm so frigging excited for this album the samples and the production and twittering effects and weird sounds just sound amazing so a shout out to Matt mows every day an all day for being one of the most riveting and intriguing musical duo's of the modern era Marissa Nadler has dropped a brand new track in single titled poison featuring John Cale of Velvet Underground Fame while John Cale's presences is not overbearing on the track or anything like that John Cale fans may have wanted a bit more John Cale on this track but still it is an incredible ballad it very well produced a very naked and up front as far as the production goes and Marissa's delivery on this thing is absolutely dark and heart-wrenching Lew the human came through with I think a much more formidable single I feel like this one's a bit more hard-hitting than his last one frankly which I think got a good momentum going but didn't really do dropping my pen here didn't really do a whole lot with it this one is titled painkiller paradise and it's just got a really raw delivery and performance on it so Lew the human you know for those who have enjoyed his flow his lyricism his energy that comes through on a track while this one may be kind of dark he definitely does bring that on this new song for sure health and JPEG mafia have crossed paths on a brand new track titled hate you and it's an absolute banger Peggy is a monster on the cut Health's industrial noisy soundscapes in the background are absolutely devilish and it's pretty short but hits pretty hard and leaves an impression also Hayden Thorp of wild beasts Fame we know that the band wild beasts the art pop band wild beasts sadly oh they're gone you know they met their demise but Hayden Thorp now is coming out with solo material that didn't take too long I guess and it's actually pretty good this this new track titled diviner it's a very beautiful piano ballad with some odd instrumental quirks to it and yet despite the fact that you know we are talking about the vocalists from wild beasts here we are talking about some very strange and almost mystical instrumentation it doesn't we sound like a wild beasts song you know what I mean I think he's already on this on this debut track here coming through the piece of material that sounds kind of distinct from that so very happy to hear that very happy to hear artists kind of going solo and sort of finding themselves individually outside of groups that people may have known them to kind of pal around with also Freddie Gibbs an ad-lib flat tummy tee full length review of this track on the Fantana channel go check that out if you have not and yeah love this cut production is grimy and incredible and trippy and weird Freddie Gibbs is a monster on the cut of the lyrical flavor he brings on the first half of the track is totally different after the beats which in the latter half it's like a tale of two monsters on one song and yeah not really a lot of complaining to do about this cut really looking forward to what they are doing on the next project and that has been the weekly track roundup everyone again thank you for hanging out checking

81v5RK33AME,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another vital update where i go through a series of records that are making it into the beloved record collection behind me oh my god you're my you're my love you're my life god damn it you're my rock before we get too deep into that I do want to give a shout-out to our sponsor the good people over at reverb LP it's a website it's an app it's a fantastic place to buy sell and exchange vinyl to feed that record collection addiction it is a global marketplace so you can get records from all around the web a streamlined checkout process so you can get what you want quickly dedicated customer service so you're not getting ripped off in the process the site and app run nicely and smoothly it's such a great big wide world of vinyl if you want to see the site or grab the app hit up the link down below and yeah just support the people who are supporting us thank you alright first off in this this big bunch we got a big bunch first off in this big bunch I want to say you got you guys know that I'm an epic epic gamer okay I'm a hardcore epic gamer and right now we have two video game soundtracks making it into the record collection which are actually both kind of blasts from my past but first off we have on vinyl for the first time the Donkey Kong Country 2 soundtrack shout out to Dixie Kong right there the the art rendering is is not the cleanest on this thing because it's it's not exactly I don't think this is super official I don't know if this is Nintendo endorsed but I still shout out to a cow a Decca Records for coming through with this one music by David wise shoutout to him we have side a side B it's it's very short bits and snippets of all the soundtrack bits from the game excuse me and yeah it's it's a pretty clean pressing sounded decent it's got a little poster of the literal art that's in the back of the record itself and the vinyl is this wonderful light blue but also clear streak reminds me of reminds me of the ocean picture of the water level depicted on the front of the cover but look guys if you want some good old school video game soundtracks like Donkey Kong Country is it like some of that stuff was on ironically predictive of vaporwave I would say some people have come to the conclusion on the Internet so a very fun-loving that I'm getting a some some epic video game soundtracks in in the record collection for the first time and also another video game soundtrack the new toejam and earl soundtrack if you guys were gaming in the days of you remember a lot of video games having a very weird cartoony quirky aesthetic to them like clay fighter or even earthworm jim and that sort of thing in toejam and Earl was one of those titles and now they're coming back with a new game new soundtrack and I do remember the soundtrack to toe jam and earl being particularly funky and it seems like they have embraced exactly that aesthetic with this brand-new double LP soundtrack and it's a lot of sense it's a lot of sequence percussion and also quite a bit of live funky bass from mr. Cody Wright who has a very heavy bit of like and like an envelope filter on his bass so you kind of get that spell Chi Wow quality on the bass I do love this gatefold the package came together really nicely what's even more amazing is that the record is pressed in this insanely insanely bright bright orange which looks lovely on the camera and I'd actually didn't look at the the other record over here because it is a it is three sides so the other side it must have an etching or something this one's a nice deep red and the other side is in fact an etching which you can kind of make out there there we go there it is mostly on the right side there we go that is so cool that is such a cool little edging on the other side nice very ambitious package for this video game which now that I'm seeing the the record I didn't know until I actually had the record in front of me is is being presented by Adult Swim games as well pretty cool and it actually came with this concept art book as well which has the soundtrack on CD bunch of pictures of characters in the game actually pretty dope pretty cool very epic packaging for this new video game soundtrack again love the way it came together and very colourful very fun like the game itself I haven't played the new game yet I'm thinking about trying to do that as soon as I get off of my Super Smash Brothers addiction which most likely will never happen but hey you know what we can always hope maybe I'll send myself to super smash rehab or something but moving on from there we have a nice dope ten-inch from Sean price and small professor they actually have a new little record out now with some remixes and some extra stuff and the small pro in production on there is fantastic and that's also the case for this ten inch to a refrigerator pee is the name of this single and it's got a few remixes on there pretty thick pressing standard a black record oh that's a pretty cool label on the other side and it's actually a really great track like it's super smooth but gritty production and soft and Sean price as always sounds like a total beast on the mic really really really mean mugging type individual alright moving on from there this came from a fan of the show I wasn't even aware of this onyx collective release before I reviewed the band very late last year but hasn't pretty excuse me yes this is some pretty cool slightly avant weirdo New York jazz that I'm not even sure if you guys will be able to easily find a copy of honestly and weirdly enough this thing was released in in tandem with supreme second Avenue rundown it's got a handful of pretty cool tracks on it I mean onyx collective is a pretty neat outfit that I need to keep my ears on because every release that I've heard from them so far just sounds like a completely different group they're always reinventing themselves at least to some degree on every release that I come across so looking forward to what they're doing in the future and definitely feeling fortunate to have such a rare record of they're sitting in my collection wonderful this next one is not so rare but also amazing finally Quasimodo's the unseen makes it into the record collection someone asked me the other day what Madlib project would I recommend outside of like you know the obvious matte villainy pinata stuff and I had a bit of a brain fart and I threw back to you know his old Luke pack days but I should have said the unseen from Quasimodo this is a fantastic record from Lord coifs if you don't know Quasimodo is essentially producer mad libs alternate rapping persona and you know often he's on this record caught rapping and sort of like a pitched voice over some very weird abstract soulful jazzy kind of repetitive production you know the best thing about this record and mad libs rapping on it while he is not the best lyricist in MC that you're gonna come across he does create this incredible sense of just being very cartoony and very weird listening to this feels like I'm just caught in the oddest animation concept ever I just feel like I'm just trapped in this weird illustrative situation right here and it's it's just a very odd funky and I don't know immersive experience I don't know I don't think it's like the best thing that he's ever laid his fingers on but um you know it's it's definitely got a lot of character to it and a lot of personality and again it's it's almost got like a cinematic feel to it yeah it just feels like a world it feels like another dimension it feels like another place but you know like it feels like as far as like hip hop I've been transported into that like that weird wacky world from you know the Warner Brothers cartoon lore like where go go dodo lives and that sort of thing you know it's it's very like Marvin the Martian that sort of thing but I'm kind of you know just like going into a bunch of animation and nobody probably remembers next I want to give a shout out to Prince's sign of the times I've said this before and I will say it again this is easily one of the most predictive sets of pop rock soul and R&B to be released in the 1980s a lot of what goes on on this LP sounds like something that came out of the 90s frankly and it's a beautiful double LP set vinyl is pressed excellently loving the color scheme of this thing loving the outfits loving these sleeves loving the music on it loving the heavy duty sleeve that it's all packaged in and seeing this cover our up front and personal is actually a pretty excellent I do love how prince's out-of-focus and we've got this a you know sort of a visual set on all the instrumentation and just the stage setup in the background and it just really is a great record really great double LP you know one of the many great albums and prince's discography I would say like 1999 and like Purple Rain where you really do feel like you're transported into into Prince's mind next given a shout-out to Baroness's purple really excellent record so amazed that the ban bounced back in this way after that somewhat okay double album Green yellow I feel like they kind of perfected their attempts at shooting for more of a poppy metal alternative rock combo on this LP especially with tracks like shock me some of the Metallica influences on this album are amazing the only thing that would have made this record in this package better because the the pressing sounds excellent is if the record were actually purple but it's not although I'm sure that was probably a maybe some exclusive pressing at some point where this thing was in purple who the hell knows I don't know off the top of my head but you know I just feel like this album should be in purple obviously of course given that it is Baroness and we all know the illustrious art that is usually there their works are usually decked out in of course there's a you know very lovely booklet attached to this thing with some really great visions of skulls and flowers and nature and plants and loving the lyrics laid out on this thing as well so shout out to Baroness for really like just giving a shit about the the way that their records are pressed and presented because it really does pay off it looks excellent feels excellent sounds excellent also feeling and sounding excellent are these repressing zuv great records from the sleater-kinney discography from Sub Pop given my classic review of the woods I thought I would beef my collection up with some sleater-kinney vinyl and of course this sounds amazing it sounds heavy it sounds crushing and even this actually sounds a little beefed up with the refreshing Sub Pop remaster they delivered on this record or maybe it just sounds that way through the vinyl because you do get a bit more of a bass response from the vinyl record nothing really to report as far as like you know packaging or anything like that on this side it's pretty straightforward with the plastic sleeve single record quality pressing sounds real nice sounds real raw sounds real good the gatefold over here is pretty nice pretty fantastic no complaints about that it is not a very long record though so I wonder why they sort of bothered doing a double LP of it but I like this very eerie vision of the trio standing in the woods all blurred out and this is such a weird heavy ominous record for them it's it's so interesting that they went in this direction artistically and frankly this is a direction I would love love love love love to hear sleater-kinney revisit a little bit on a future album I would love to hear them continue digging into the darkness that they were able to translate on that record moving out to another dark album given that I loved the repressing z' of their other two records that I talked about in a previous vinyl update via Third Man Records I also picked up the repressing of Melvin's Houdini and this thing is heavy it is crushing it is amazing very few heavy albums from the 90s I think have aged as well as this one of course you know yeah there are other examples you know but this one sounds amazingly heavy and amazingly crushing and just fantastic just loving the sludge metal devilish sludge metal vibes that this record brings forward also Kurt Cobain is on this frigging record so I mean you know all the Kurt heads and / and Nirvana heads definitely want to listen to this if you haven't although you should already know about The Melvins at this point since Kurt you know sort of helped out their career in the first place so um you know we may not know as much about the Bellman's today if Kurt had not you know used his platform and used his fame to sort of help bands like this along so heli added the Melvin's heli added Houdini excellent record certainly not their first record certainly not their only amazing album but definitely you know one of their best and one of the best sludge metal I think has to offer in general got some hard Bob here for you guys monk's music felonious monk if you're looking to get in some jazz okay like maybe you don't know much about jazz and you're just trying to get started it's an excellent starter record not only is this one a felonious monks best records this album also features one of the most beautiful intro tracks of any jazz album around also Art Blakey is on this thing john coltrane is on this thing before he came out with pretty much every classic album that he hit that he ever came out with so you have some real Giants of jazz on this one pretty easy to digest album playing some fantastic hard bop like amazing performances on this thing very bold maybe not the flashiest but very bold and very in-your-face a lot of attitude on this record I'll say pretty straight forward pressing simple sleeve simple sleeve information on the back and all that stuff but you know given that this was recorded and mixed to be listened to on this format really the value in something like this is to hear it on vinyl through a great record rather a great sound system is what I want to say bit of a brain fart there I apologize guys so really that's you know that's that's where you're getting the value out of out of records like that all right we're gonna end off with a the the wonderful cherry on top of a very dark cherry on top of mr. David Bowie's discography black star I got this record late and I actually it took me a while to actually put it on to the turntable and listen to it and goddamn is this album so fantastic and so dark it's it's nice when you give yourself space from a record for a while and then you can kind of come back and listen to it almost as if you know you're like listening to it for the first time again and just thoroughly impressed with the pressing and the presentation on this thing the black on black as you can kind of see at the very bottom the black on black print and pressing and kind of catch it in the light there of all of the track times and the track titles the record itself slides out of here and is in this super thick plastic sleeve it's a pretty heavy-duty plastic sleeve too it's not not a not a weak sleeve and of course it comes with this really illustrious and wonderfully printed art book this is an excellent package for a record this is like excellent freaking packaging this is like 10 out of 10 packaging for this album to have like the the black on black print this great book these images of Bowie are fantastic and very ominous and strange there's not really a single thing I can complain about with this packaging it's amazing it's absolutely amazing so yeah so happy I got this not only because this is one of Bowie's best and actually on on vinyl this record sounds a bit thicker and there's a bit more presence to the sound of it then in the somewhat dry and somewhat digital version of the recording which is still great but this definitely has a bit more flavor to it at least it sounded like to me a bit more punch a bit more bass and the instrumentation just had like a fuller I'll say even a more panoramic sound to it whereas the the digital recording when I first reviewed the record you know when I downloaded it it sounded a little um squeezed together you know this felt like it had a lot more space to it hearing it on this this format so super happy to have this and just love the packaging love the look of it love the feel of it love the simplicity to it and yet the detail is well so an excellent excellent excellent so this has been another vinyl update thank you very much everyone for watching hopefully you guys got some good recommendations out of this thing if you haven't heard some of these records before and you're the best you're the best you're the best you're the best let me know down in the comments if you if you like if you wish what records maybe have made it into your collection recently and I will be catching you guys in the next one okay Anthony Fantan oh here I love you all the records that we have talked about in this video are mentioned and listed down below and also remember once again the good people sponsoring us over a reverb LP and yeah yeah yeah yeah over here next to my head is a playlist of videos from our vinyl update and record collection series you can hit that up or a link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana vinyl updates forever 
MWsI9V7KmEM,uh hi everyone tax breaks here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the news our face and in Ghostface Killah albums our face meets ghost face this is a new collaborative album from the comic book villain inspired and also MF DOOM inspired hip hop trio known as czar face featuring MC esoteric inspected deck and 7l on production all these guys have been in the game a while and are essentially East Coast hardcore hip-hop vets and now with this new record over here they are bringing on The Ghost Face Killa which is actually a pretty exciting prospect not only because of the obvious whoo tang connection between inspected deck and ghost butt ghost face Killa has come out with his own material recently that has been heavily comic-book inspired he's also you know mr. Tony Stark's Ghostface Killah has also worked with MF DOOM in the past as well the fit between ghost and czar face is actually so sensible and natural that the results might end up being painfully predictable to the point where I'm just not sure if this is exactly what is our face needs right now because while I do think the trio did start off pretty well earlier this decade with a couple of very good two great records ever since every hero needs a villain I feel like the trio has slowly been painting themselves into a corner the MF DOOM crossover they delivered last year did kind of pick up the excitement a little bit and unfortunately that newfound electricity that I hoped would be here with the entrance of Ghost Face it's it's it's not here there are actually multiple tracks on this thing that Ghost Face doesn't even appear on even the longest track on this record toward the end of the album which has the most transitions of any track here feasibly the most space of any saw in here why is ghost not on this cut I just feel like if czar face had anything exciting to do on their own at this point they would have done that instead of going so quickly into yet another collaborative record and this is so scanned as well in comparison with the doom album last year I mean in a lot of ways this record does check the usual box is that as our face album does you do get another helping of 7ls quality and dramatic and funky and soulful instrumentals that sound like a mix of classic hardcore hip-hop production mixed with like the incidental music of a classic 70s superhero cartoon like the instrumental from the King heard voices it sounds like a mix of boom-bap with like The Body Snatcher soundtrack there are some elements of the instrumentals here that do feel a little old-school cinematic kind of weird kind of sci-fi a little Twilight Zone occasionally there are some really cool beats witches occasionally there are some crazy zany vocal samples and weird colorful sound effects the beats on this thing are simultaneously grimy and quirky they're the best thing on the record in my opinion and yet they do so little to make up for all the lyrical shortcomings of czar face meets ghost face there are so many completely average ghosts face verses on this thing not only does he drop multiple uninteresting verses on this record but his flow on the song mongolian beef absolutely sucks it's got no groove he's barely on tempo he's like blue face in the beat or at least like this is what I think people who hate blue face thinks blue face sounds like for a handful of guys who are directly connected to what's seen as like a golden age of lyricism in rap music the bars on this record are kind of unimpressive it's mostly a case-by-case basis from track to track there are cuts on here where ghosts and s oh and I ns do come out with all guns blazing the intro track faceoff kicks things off pretty decently the song iron claw I think front to back is pretty great like when Esso says you put the s in wordplay you get swordplay so you know that stabbing tracks is my forte or I n s when he says what you see is real what you've heard is false all I have in this world is my word my balls money calling stomach talking hungry often on his Hawken haters hatin funny talking but there are plenty of eyebrow-raising rhymes and similes on this thing that completely overshadow highlights like these a electric toothbrush the level of your Buzzbee I do it on my own you need a click like BuzzFeed or this one line about avoiding political spittin and truthfully the only Breitbart I know is Simpson putting my palm on my face putting my palm on my face my alma mater is the school of hard knocks today's special grilled medulla oblongata but I ain't pickin up what they puttin down it's like I got a bad back but they just a sad sack sad rap helter skelter I seen people stabbed in the shelter actin bipolar like they grabbin Seltzer still getting our burgundy and gray on we colorful like that box of 64 crayons the hardest Ghostface bar of all time coming for that loot off top no recouping the way they avoid your boy call me glutton that line comes off of 'he's arcade 87 one of a few tracks on this thing that sounds like a really bad MC from the 80s wrote it i feel like a lot of the time what this album is presenting us lyrically is like hip hop's answer to dad jokes these are just like dad bars but instead of trying to be funny they're like trying to be slick or hard or impressive but just like a dad joke all it does is just a licit like this there's also something about inss delivery on this record that kind of bugs me it sort of seems like he's he's rapping in this fashion where he puts on this voice that i'm rapping i'm rapping i'm rapping rapping i'm rapping it's totally unnatural if you've heard the lyrical and instrumental formula of one track on this thing you've most likely heard the instrumental and lyrical formula of 75% of this record these guys do come through with a pretty sharp concept cut on morning routine which does have a good sense of humor and a really interesting progression even if there are a few lines that do make me groan the King heard voices is one of the few cuts on this thing with a proper hook but the chorus is absolutely awful because Kendra Morris's voice is layered and harmonized with these chorus effects that makes her singing sound like she's an obnoxious alien there's also an intro on this thing that I can't quite get my head around we don't really go into the whole comic book thing but instead it sounds like a really bad wrestling promo getting cut where the person is he a hero is he he'll there's a point where he sounds like he's almost an announcer but also a wrestler he slips in and out toward the end of a really bad Macho Man Randy Savage impression it's really awkward and goes on way too long and does an awful job of setting the tone then the album ends off for the track that's labeled as if it's like a left over cut or something but it sounds really no less significant than any other song on here which I think says a lot about the quality of the other tracks on this record there are really only a couple of songs on this thing that I enjoyed from front to back there are a lot of listenable moments on this record I think but in order to get there you have to kind of ignore what's going on lyrically most of the time and I'm not really sure what to say about this record at this point other than that I'm just disappointed I feel like everyone on this record outside of 7l is just severely punching under their weight nothing Ghostface did on this thing blew me away the drop in quality i ns presents from the last album to this album is slightly shocking in just how many corny bars he's putting out there perverse Esso is easily the most impressive and consistent rapper on this entire record but again it's really not enough to lift up the entire LP I'm feeling a light too decent 5 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate er the best or the best which should I

4x0g-Evv_PQ,ha ha ha hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Jessica Pratt album quiet signs california-based singer and songwriter Jessica Pratt the last time I talked about her music at length I think was back in 2012 when she dropped a debut record that showed a lot of promise this album was a pretty simple but effective recording of Jessica's very calming and serene finger pic guitar along with her very tiny nasally incredibly unique voice which sounded almost alien or enchanted there wasn't a whole lot of layers or density to this record but it made up for that with some very solid songwriting again along with a voice and a style that just made her someone to watch closely into the future her follow-up record in 2015 featured a better recording more instrumentation less blemishes it was definitely more refined it was more pleasant but it was somehow just missing something I guess occasionally the extra layers of instrumentation and vocals did come together somewhat awkwardly especially on the song game that I play generally it's a pretty pleasant album it checked a lot of the same boxes the debut did but somehow just felt less the witching less magical and instead sometimes tedious sometimes winding even with all of the extra bits of instrumentation it was not as smoothly executed still from that sophomore record Jessica did give us quite a bit to look forward to and quiet signs is a pretty nice little album a beautiful little record and I do mean little as this album is essentially just nine tracks and 27 minutes there's even a time-killing intro on this record that is essentially an awkward piano version of the same melody and chord progression played throughout the very next track not a whole lot of time to work with on this one let's start dishing out the fire as soon as possible and honestly by the time we're halfway through the first track that very same melody and chord progression I'm kind of sick of it at that point because it's grown quite tedious but still it does not take very long on this record for Jessica's sound and song quality to pick right up I'm not sure what it is but Jessica is incredibly unique voice just soaked in the amount of reverb that is on this album combined with the slightly vintage aesthetic of the recording it just creates this beautiful buttery blissful heavenly vibe between the gentle guitar strumming and the piano and the flute on this thing it's it's just it creates this serenity that's likely to go unmatched this year the vocals aren't nearly as intelligible as they were on the last album but that's not as big a deal for me because I feel like I almost listen to this record as if it's an ambient release or just like a mood setter and the very repetitive guitar phrasing throughout this record does make listening to it in that way kind of easy and I do think this is a record that can be listened to both passively and actively that smudgey nostalgic very throwback 70s funk feel that the recording gives off just has this very sunny bliss to it that makes it easy to just get lost in the atmosphere but then again there are moments where you have lead melodies on the track like poly blue that are just too gorgeous not to eat up and pay direct attention to I also love the wonderfully archaic chords and melodies on the track crossing sounds almost medieval to a degree the record coasts out with a very beautifully written closer to but as far as songwriting highlights on this album go that's pretty much it I feel like a lot of the time I'm really just lost again in the aesthetic of this record and not really much else and that's not to say that there aren't quality ideas on this album there definitely are but the main problem is that they're just so scanned there's not a whole lot to this album I mean I can appreciate a shorter record or even an EP of this length too but I feel like if you're going to put out this much material and that's it like it's all got to be fantastic from beginning to end you can't have a single snoozer or a low or a somewhat interesting moment in an album of this length it's got to be nothing but your best stuff because there's no room for anything else as much as I do like a lot of the material and the overall sound of this release I'm really just left wanting more because when the tunes on here are fantastic they are fantastic and when the subtly psychedelic smeary production of this album enhances the quality of that songwriting it enhances it a lot I do love Pratt's voice I do love her slightly minimalist approach to building her songs out and I do like the very easygoing and kind of trippy sound she's drawn up here but unfortunately what she served up with this record is just far too meager to get as excited about it as I would like to be I'm feeling a decent - a strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Jessica Pratt quiet signs forever 
0YPMV6iTy-U,hi everyone drusen Adriano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the old Drake mixtape so far gone this is the breakthrough 2009 mixtape from Toronto rap Titan Drizzy Drake who has recently reissued this project over here for its 10 year anniversary so far gone is actually a pretty important informative moment for one of the biggest voices in hip-hop right now and like it or not Drake has actually changed the face of hip-hop pretty significantly it's also crazy to think just how predictive a lot of the ideas on this tape were I mean on the song Bria's interlude featuring Omari on the track essentially sounds like a weakened song before there even was such a thing as a weakened song two years before house of balloons even came out there's also the matter of how unorthodox so far gone was for its time how mellow and how sensitive and even occasionally antisocial the tone of this album was Drake doesn't like the club Drake doesn't like campus life it was definitely a new angle for the mainstream there was also this lyrical fixation on things like romance as well as gossip and of course it was all delivered in this slightly sad puppy demeanor for 2009 hip hop albums so far gone is so profoundly unmanly and Drake was incredibly conscious of this at the time addressing this very issue on tracks like best I ever had with lines about how girls will buy his CD when he drops his debut record for the picture and guys'll buy it and claims for their little sister and even though right now Drake is incredibly popular incredibly successful he has subverted a lot of the macho stereotypes of The Bling era that this tape came out during the tail end of at the time when this project dropped Drake's sensitivity was something that he was brutally ridiculed for and at the time this ridicule from and rejection by the hip-hop community that Drake just so desperately wanted to be a part of it would paint a lot of the material he would drop down the road with Drake showing quite a bit of scorn toward those who weren't so accepting of his new sounded style and looking back on what was turning heads in 2009 in hip-hop there wasn't really a anything out there that was quite like so far gone Raekwon just came out with his Cuban Linx equal dooms born like this dropped also Kid Cudi's man on the moon to mos def dropped one of his weirdest projects DeShawn's excellent Boy Meets World came out Lil B was trying to put cloud rap on the map with six kiss and Asher Roth was the new great white hiphop hope for frat boys who love to hate College of course some of Drake's biggest influences are still kicking around the time of this tape dropping Lil Wayne for one who was still at a huge peak of relevancy when he decided to endorse Drake bring him on to Young Money make multiple appearances on this project it cannot be emphasized enough just how pivotal Wayne was to Drake success you also have Kanye West who had just dropped 808s & Heartbreak just a year earlier a record that I'm not sure Drake would even exist without an instrumental off that album even turns up on this tape which Drake had to get permission for the inclusion of for this new re-release which created this big Kanye Twitter meltdown that happened a little while ago I'm not going to get into it again basically the point I'm trying to make is that the Melo chili fusions of hip hop and R&B presented on so far gone it set the stage for a lot of stuff and even though it is a very deeply flawed and rough mixtape the impact of this thing is to the tenth power of any critically acclaimed album that dropped the same year and because of that it's kind of interesting to go back 10 years and hear how much Drake has progressed or maybe not progressed since then what ideas was he still perfecting and what kind of risks was he still willing to take because he hadn't fully developed himself yet what I can say for sure is that the biggest hits off of this tape still sound fantastic today best I ever had and successful tracks that I think addressed two pretty key Drake modes you have a pandering pop rap cut about someone you're so in love with you're basically sucking their toes and the tone lyrically of the track is so general that basically anyone can project themselves on to it and you also have a kind of moody and forlorn rap cut that is about striving for more and aspiring in such a way where you're inviting the audience to desire more along with you and these are themes that some of Drake's biggest hits today still boil down to whether you're talking about tracks like nice for what or even started from the bottom and in Drake's defense he's been right to focus on these ideas and themes more as he has gone deeper into his discography but not every song off of this mixtape is like this there are some real ear sores in the tracklist on this thing that saw Drake testing a lot of concepts that didn't really pan out like all of the weird indie crossovers it's kind of weird to think of a time in mainstream music where rappers might be trying to seek validation by appealing to one of the deadest wings of popular music right now we have the song let's call it off which sees Drake essentially just vocally riffing on an instrumental e altered version of Peter Bjorn and John's let's call it off it's kind of like a cover but it's also kind of not we also have Drake doing his own thing over an altered version of Santigold's unstoppable which features one of the worst verses little Wayne has ever recorded it's just completely nonsensical auto-tune garbage Drake's revision of licky leaves a little bit has an age that badly but honestly I'd much rather listen to the original in the spirit of one of his biggest influences little Wayne Drake essentially tries to build his own profile by just doing his own thing vocally over another artists work which conceptually is not a bad thing it's just that Drake's attempts at this mostly come up empty-handed his best attempt to styling on another artists work actually comes through on the track say what's real which sees Drake rapping on like a looped version of Kanye's say you will 808s & Heartbreak instrumental which I actually think is a kind of defining piece of inspiration for Drake at this point in his career because this is a pretty compelling song that sees Drake locked in the midst of an emotional internal monologue or like an impassioned confession and Drake has made sure on pretty much every project since this one to put at least one song in this tone on his new records and I would say he repeats that same formula on tracks like the column and ignant shit these are also cuts where Drake delivers some of the smartest and most hilarious wordplay on the entire record and he really shows just how much little Wayne's lyrical ability greatly influences his pen games as much as I like these songs though there are lot of other tracks on this record that to me just kind of read as mixed results the song Houston Lanta Vegas just still sounds like a hot mess the instrumental is a totally blobby junk pile that does not sound appealing at all totally stiff groove and Drake's vocal lines on top of this instrumental do very little to bring this track any sanity or soul these song November 18th is a somewhat weird and kind of awkward attempt at embracing an old-school Houston sound with Drake dropping numerous bars in this deeply pitched voice where he puts on a southern accent the song uptown is just merely okay I think it could have been better had it not featured yet another predictable little Lane verse on it on top of it bun B delivers this amazingly phoned in verse you can kind of tell he didn't exactly think this project was going to jumpstart one of the biggest careers in rap but honestly at the time who could see that coming generally the mix job on a lot of these tracks and instrumentals is kind of rough which doesn't exactly reflect all that positively on Noah 40 but you know at the time Drake was still leveling up a lot too as messy as some parts of this tape are I can't deny that they were doing a lot with a little and that their ideas made up for a lot of the shortcomings on the execution side of things because occasionally on this thing Drake's delivery does feel pretty unpolished there are moments on the opening track where he doesn't even sound like himself for what we know Drake to sound like mostly because he hadn't quite fully developed that trademark nasally tone that we instantly recognized him for Drake's singing at this point in his career while he was not shy about doing it on record he wasn't exactly at his best vocally which does not really bode well for a lot of the buttery R&B cuts on this thing it wouldn't really be until take care that I think Drake would come into his own vocally and just start sounding less robotic and more expressive I know it's easy to say this in hindsight but there are actually some pretty groundbreaking ideas on this record but the quality of this tape overall it's just super inconsistent for the entirety of his career Drake has always been about the hits typically the hits that come off his records are pretty great as long as he keeps that up there's always going to be demand for Drake all in all though I'm still pretty indifferent toward this tape I'm not all that crazy about it you'll have a handful of tracks off of it it is cool to go back and listen to what ideas Drake stuck to and which ones didn't really pan out into anything going back to a project like this does feel like you're staring into the petri dish of history and observing the earliest stages of something very significant I can't really say I get much more out of it than that though I'm feeling a decent two strong five on this thing transition have you given this tape a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're

new compilation gangster music vol 1 which you can pre-order now they recently dropped a new music video and a track from the compilation featuring mad lib and oh no big whips as the title of the track it's a very funky very entertaining lo-fi hiphop track with a lot of soul and quite a bit of you know a lot a lot of whip talk you know that that sort of thing you know if you're big if you're a big gearhead that sort of thing sorry I'm being dorky on purpose but really looking forward to this compilation honestly this is actually a really cool undertaking the artists involved looked amazing and I am really impressed gangster doodles essentially you know came together and and and and pulled this fucking shit together it's amazing so again hefty shout-out link down there in the description box where you can see the new music video and you can hear the new track and you can pre-order the compilation please do so because gangster doodles is freaking amazing and also another shout out son just dropped a brand new preview of their upcoming album the title of it is life metal should be coming out in April I didn't really know what to make of the preview over here as it seemed like I didn't really get a full whiff of one entire progression or movement across the entire thing and also given the very long read of this new record in the description of this teaser it would seem that there's like a lot that goes on on this record that is not necessarily spoiled in the preview itself but it is very heavy it is very loud does sound very primitive and jeroni so I don't know I guess where we're essentially looking forward to new son album boys new son album on the way yay [Music] alright let's get into the tracks that I thought were are the worst tracks still getting over the flu and the post nasal drip so I apologize for that alright first off this new cut from an artist who goes by the name of two poor crazy girls is the name of this new cut over here and yeah as somebody who's had kind of a dicey past with the whole emo trap thing I absolutely do not like this at all and I think it's really corny and obnoxious however if you love this emo trap shit I think you will actually die for this song this will probably be your your new favorite track so hey you know I don't care for it but maybe it's your new favorite jam maybe it really is I'm moving on from there this new track from sir baby girl crush on me is one of the hottest bits of garbage I think I've been subjected to this week not only does the sound and the look of this video to me vibe kind of like the this is like how weird Billy Eilish thinks she is but the the the vocals on this are awful the tune is terrible the concept of the track is annoying and I don't know the the music video itself is a complete eyesore so I don't know what else to say about outside of that but I'm sure people who love this thing are like yeah fuck that guy he's an asshole and that's fine moving on from there offset of migos fame has a brand new track out with a very goth and very edgy piece of artwork on the front of it but it's absolutely boring super boring basic trap spacey beat boring migos flows lyrically he goes a little bit into his past and gets a bit sentimental but it's it doesn't really amount to anything all that narrative or intriguing or unique for offset just kind of sounds like another piece of music from the migos camp that really could have used the other two Amigo's frankly moving on from there this brand-new track from Kalani Butterfly is absolutely boring I have no idea who in the industry is approving this stuff it is totally drab lifeless and has no personality whatsoever just not really getting this song at all butterfly just totally lost on me and also alex is on fire familiar drugs the melodic metalcore band is back with a new track that seems to embrace all the worst elements of alt metal and pop metal and metalcore and there's like I don't know like a bit of a southern metal element to it as well gets it's a real hodgepodge of a lot of cliched ideas that are totally stale by now and I think that's all I have to say about that alright let's move on to the tracks that I thought were kind of meth but still worth shouting out still worth mentioning first off telekinesis has a brand new record on the way the power pop project and this brand new cut over here a place in the Sun while it may be a little mean potatoes and run of the mill for power pop standards it is a very fun track and has a nice distorted quality to it some very bright sunny vocals a good attitude should definitely get your body movin tacocat while I did find the performance and recording of this brand new track grains of salt to be kind of awkward maybe a little stiff could have been a bit more groovy and fluid I still do kind of like the throwback weirdo seventies pop rock eighties pop rock vibe of this track quite a bit so tacocat looking at tacocat right here it's it's quirky its quirky moving on from there the rock hound tors dropped a couple of tracks this past December that slipped by me because I wasn't doing weekly track round ups around that time new record on the way I imagine Sunday driver and now that you're gone are the name of these two tracks now that you're gone is is more the chill ballad type cut which I thought was pretty decent meanwhile Sunday driver hit a lot harder but I thought a lot of the riffs and grooves came off a bit stiff just not sure what to say I mean I wish the band was sounding a bit more adventurous given Jack's recent output but I don't know you can't you can't win them all it's okay I think it's okay I guess I'll just leave it at that moving on from there this band mr. fire has a brand new record on the way via a season of mist and it's it's a nice old-school combination of black metal and heavy metal I do think the recording is a bit shoddy but intentionally so the band is performing and just like a very raw state but I do find the the various vocal shifts and the the songwriting to be actually kind of entertaining that's very theatrical and very melodic and very dark and very foreboding so I give it a shot give it a shot if you're looking for more of an old-school black metal sound moving on from there why Disputes has a brand new cut out of row rhodonite which i'm not sure to pronounce that word I apologize and grief I don't know man a lot of the tracks building up to this new album is yeah the the they're just not doing much for me and and this track to me was well it's not terrible it's maybe been the most disappointing so far because this cut just basically sounds like a subpar me without you song I'm not exactly sure why I don't know why the band would basically ripped that band off so blatantly but the more dreary guitar passages combined with the vocal delivery placed over them it just sounds like a meat without you track and again not not exactly sure why it's not exactly like they do the sound justice or anything like that so moving on from there Zedd and Katy Perry team up on a brand new cut 365 which is a kind of cute tribute to love and automation and AI and romance in the digital age I guess it's not the worst track either of them have ever been an attached to but certainly not my favorite Katy Katy Perry song by a long shot moving on from there Jessie ware has a brand new cut out adore you and yeah it's kind of a fun driving electronic a romantic jam not too bad very chill very laid-back got a sensual feel to it but doesn't exactly stick out in my opinion moving on from there a Holy Ghost Holy Ghost the New York dance pop and synth pop duo they are back with a brand new couple of cuts not as post-punk II this time around on these new tracks but still Epton on Broadway parts 1 & 2 yeah unfortunately I found this cut to be a little bland though I do like the very groovy jamish vibe the group creates in the part 2 section of the song quite a bit still digging the the throwback synth pop vibes that they're able to string up in in their sound though moving on from there the Japanese pop rock and post punk outfit chai is back with a brand new cut and choose go is the name of the song I think this came out very very very late or last week or early this week and I missed it for the last weekly track roundup but I thought I would shout it out here because it is a pretty peppy track with a lot of personality and character to it not one of my favorite tracks that I think they've dropped recently but it still has quite a bit of quirk to it and it's attached to a very well shot and fun music video Oh freakin Bruno Mars and frickin car DB are back with a brand new track please me is the name of this cut and I gave it a full length review over on the Fantana channel it's pretty raunchy it's pretty sexy decent chemistry between these two on the track but it's nowhere near as fun and danceable and as i guess what's the word I'm looking for smile inducing as the finesse remix you know this is uh this one's for the adults okay this one's for those sexy adult situations I guess if you happen to find yourself in the midst of one moving on from there let's try after Broken Social Scene new record on the way and this is actually the first Broken Social Scene track boyfriend's is in the name of the song in a while that is actually like kind of wowed me a little bit I do love the pulsating and slowly growing grande instrumentation presented on this track it is pretty lovely even if it's not one of my favorite tracks this week it definitely does have me looking forward to the next thing Broken Social Scene are doing and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best best best tracks this week the ones that really hit me wowed me stunned me knocked me on my ass but BAM first off I want to give a shout out to this brand new wise blood track which I'm actually very pleased to enjoy this track because the last wise blood song I thought was pretty great as well every day is the title of this new song it's a very clever little love song and it's attached to this hilarious music video that seems like a 70s throwback slasher flick it's very cute it's very funny diggin it quite a bit diggin it quite a bit and the instrumentation on this cut is very rich and lovely Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers have had a sort of previously unreleased song put out and the name of this new track over here is for real and it's actually a really great retrospective track that just has quite a bit of meaning to it being released at this point posts the heyday of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers post Tom Petty's passing it's again a very significant tract about basically everything that drove Tom Petty to do what he did in music in the industry all the success that his songs and his talents brought him it's actually a pretty incredible track for anybody who has ever been touched by Tom Petty's music in any significant way at any point in their lives moving on from there there is a brand new track from Tim Hecker out new album on the way that world is the name of the cut and it's actually really beautiful it's a very lengthy piece which Tim Acker doesn't embark on a lot of those lately anyway but you know he's kind of expanding I think a little bit on this song it seems like there's a lot of woodwinds in the mix a lot of layers it's very blissful it's very heavenly it's very enchanting and absolutely droney and gorgeous looking forward to hearing Tim I guess expound on these types of tropes and ideas on a brand new record moving on from there Slater Slater is back with a brand new track mine is the name of it and it is a sweet lickety-splickety I don't know why I said that I apologize I'm I'm making terrible Corey Feldman references right now but it's a very sweet piece of dance pop with a very well crooned me young man I just love the groove I love the beat out of the build-up to it the verses transition really well under the course is very well produced the vocals are absolutely sexy and fun and playful it's a very bubbly track and a must listen for the pop heads out there for the dance pop heads out there listen to this shit alright moving on from their new house brand new track from our Bowie mr. you know who it is it's Rex orange county new record on the way I imagine looking forward to that and our friend here basically delivers on to us a pretty well written and produced piece of pop soul looking forward to hearing this dudes I guess a profile grow because with songs like this it is most certainly going to do that alright moving on from their quali Chris is back new record on the way guns is the name of the new record guns has also named the the new track and it's very chilled out it's very it's very laid back it's very soulful and jazzy heady cerebral cut as we expect quite like Chris to be every once in a while he'll drop a kooky hard-hitting track but this is not one of those songs this is a again more the heady more lyrical experience where he's got a particular topic in mind obviously from the look of the cover art alone and moving on from there pronouns is the name of a music project that is at least new to me or rather pronoun I apologise pronoun singular stay is the name of this new track over here and it's very jangly it's a very great sharp Lee written and performed piece of pop rock that is super catchy absolutely loving the energy emanating off of this track do not miss this song in fact do not miss any of the tracks that I'm telling you are our best this week because they all kick fucking ass Liz oh ah has come through with a brand new soul banger cuz I love you it's got a bit of trap percussion in the background but has some amazing horn work great chord progression great fusion of classic and modern sounds her voice is stupendous on the song cuz she kicks ass on this track Liz oh is Liz Liz oh is that that individual right now she is that individual okay Liz oh is that individual so look forward look forward to this new Liz Oh record okay get hyped up on these singles because they are good as shit juice world has a brand new cut out emo rap king right now emo rap king as I was saying earlier emo rap can be very hit or miss for me I would say in this case though with this new song robbery it's a hit okay it's a hit loving the the strained overacted vocals on this track loving how melodic the instrumental is it is just sad and as emo as fuck and the music video is just way way way way way over the top it's too much with all the Goths and you know all the fire in the background it's it's a lot but it's a very catchy track it's I I think I think emo rap definitely has a future if juice world keeps coming out with songs of this quality Jenny Lewis has a brand new ballad out which I thought was a nice breath of fresh air post the last single she dropped this one was very well put together and instantly catchy and had a strong emotionally potent quality to it the name of this one scares me is heads gonna roll his heads gonna roll his heads gonna roll so shout out to Jenny Lewis definitely looking forward to that new record also shout out to the boy Denzel Curry who along with triple j has dropped an amazing cover an amazing rendition of the song kick-ass track amazing song one of the best songs of the 90s one of my favorite songs of all time honestly and Denzel curry and some local boys from the Australia area definitely come through on this amazing amazing amazing fantastic cover of this track Denzel screams his brains out he hits all the Zack de la Rocha Hughes totally kicks ass amazing track amazing rendition moving on from there Blueface baby has a brand new remix of thought tiana out and features cardi B and it's actually my favorite so far so you know it's just kind of another remix cardi is way over the top on this track the swallow that nut

track roundup forever 
mW7m4r2Ul2Q,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for a review of the brand-new Shu Shu record girl with basket of fruit this is the latest full-length album from california-based post pop post-punk post art noise outfit Shu Shu as always masterminded by multi-instrumentalist and producer Jamie Stewart Shu Shu also continues to boast the talents of Angela Co who co-produced this album along with Greg Sagnier of Deerhoof Fame and in the past year Shu Shu has also gained the talents of thore Harris who you might remember from many a swans album also indie veteran Jordin Gieger of hospital ships as well as the Appleseed cast mostly to fill out via the live set there's also a pretty lengthy and impressive personnel list for this album which we are showing you right now that features a lot of extra vocalists a lot of extra percussion the latter of which has not really been a super big focus on many of Shu shus past records but the band's discography has been very creatively volatile as of late from surprise collaborations to purely experimental detours that are released exclusively online you have the Nina Simone covers album you have the Twin Peaks covers album the harrowing in blood-curdling angel guts red classroom as well as the band's return to more of a pop forum on their last full-length record forget so there hasn't been a whole lot of predictability in this era of Shu shus discography right now and yet the band continues to drop some of their most thrilling and exciting material yet and girl with basket of fruit is no exception this record may just be 9 songs in 37 minutes but it is a powerfully twisted artistic statement that pulls absolutely no punches and is easily one of Shu shus most out-there albums yet Shu Shu does their best to ward off the faint of heart on this album right from the start of the record with the title track where all that percussion I was talking about earlier shows up in spades it's one nasty lo-fi bustling beat layered on top of another battling for attention in the mix it's messy its distorted it's chaotic it's absolutely overwhelming and even Captain Beefheart ish in some respects Jamie Stewart on top of all of this instrumental madness delivers these shrieked and shouted bits of totally absurd poetry chock full of insane quotables she's in love with the angel of no taxi anywhere her boob gets so floppy she uses it as a fan to wave away his sickening Bo yeah those are really real life things that are set on this album I'm not joking with you it's just so profoundly twisted with the tinkering beats and the distortion and the ravings of an absolute madman all the sour tones laced throughout the track as well there's also a similar vibe on the track scissors which was an amazing teaser cut to this record but while there may be many moments on this record that are just too weird for words that's not to say that what's occurring here is just totally batshit or just random as there are quite a few themes and lyrical ideas that are repeated throughout key points on the record like something coming out as a joke which may be a statement on the music the band is making on this album itself as well as jerking it into mush our ideas that are not only mentioned in the opening track but also the following cut as well but this time with a much more foreboding instrumental thunderous distorted beats industrial atmosphere surrounding everything lots of hellish noise slowly building before the band goes Full Tilt into all these glitchy bits of demented melodies and skipping samples and keep in mind these are like experimental noise spoken shouted word pieces through and through any elements of rock music and pop music that fans might remember from Shu shus previous releases have completely melted away on this record on a March even mood Jamie delivers more unhinged poetry over these groaning buh double bass notes eventually his lyrics his vocals devolve into literal babbling boo-boo and it's an all right cut on the record I suppose as more low-key moments on this album goes I do prefer the track wrong thing where Jamie's more measured vocals and clear vocal melodies set against these very sad and droning and mournful synth chords are a breath of fresh air on this very relentless record kind of a very necessary bittersweet moment the song ice-cream-truck sees the sonic mayhem getting turned up once again on this record all I have to say about this track is what a horrible way to treat sound not to act like I dislike this song I do like it in fact I love it but the sounds on this track are so dusty and claustrophobic I feel like I'm sitting in the middle of a meat locker but instead of like hanging animal corpses it's it's strung up and hooked and decapitated sounds it's just a pile of sound corpses and Jamie's poetry is essentially him just like jamming a flag into the pile hair dyed blonde for nobody nobody move I also love the disturbing beats and samples on the track pumpkin attack on mommy and daddy which features these weird overwhelming sometimes pitch sometimes skipping vocal snippets throughout the track wailing Halloween cents a beat that sounds like someone's trying to make a club banger from hell but easily the most disturbing song on the entire record has to go to Mary Turner Mary Turner which is honestly one of the most disturbing songs shoo-shoo has ever put out in their entire discography and if you know anything about shoo shoo they have a pretty dark despondent discography now this track is quite literally about a woman in the early 1900s who was lynched for protesting the lynching of her husband and given Jamie's complete lack of fear on this record when it comes to lyrics and when it comes to vocals so far it should be no surprise that he takes it very far on this track as far as the subject matter goes so far that anybody who has a soul by the end of this track should have their skin crawling and anyone listening to this track who's never really reflected on the history of hatred in this country that led to barbaric practices like lynching might have to just sit down after this cut and have a very deep reflective thing as these are practices that are not that all not that long forgotten and the effects of which are very far-reaching and cannot merely be forgotten in a few generations the closing cut on this thing normal love is actually one of the prettier and more serene tracks on the album but it's actually still a kind of disturbing duet of sorts between Jamie Stewart and Eugene Robinson of Oxbow Fame there's some very gentle pianos on this track some upright bass Jamie and Eugene's vocals twist and sort of meld together in this beautifully horrifying way I feel like I'm listening to poltergeist singing together because they're trapped forever on this earthly plane they don't want to be on so they're trying to sing their pain away man this is a very potent and hard-hitting album what a shocking unique ugly and gorgeously dark record and undoubtedly a high point in Shu shus discography so far and really encouraging - to see a group of Shu shus age and of their talents still coming out with groundbreaking and cutting-edge and exciting material good on Jamie and good on Angela for never giving up on pushing this project in a direction where it continues to give listeners a unique one-of-a-kind experience I'm feeling a light - decent 9:00 on this thing transition have you given this album a

bPLvfWRBi70,hi everyone sneeze sneak off tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new LCD soundsystem record Electric Lady sessions this is the latest project from famed American indie tronic alternative dance and post-punk outfit LCD Soundsystem and it's essentially a record of session recordings the band laid down over the course of several days at Electric Lady studios in Manhattan while they were in the midst of a tour behind their last full-length album American Dream a record that if you remember was essentially their comeback album after a very long hiatus and what was essentially a promise the band was breaking up for good and if you also remember I was one of the few people that didn't really care for the record at all personally I thought a lot of the performances off this thing we're kind of underwhelming the wit and fun and exuberance of lcd's music was really lacking on this one and while it's far from the worst album I'd ever heard I do think it is LCD Soundsystem's worst album so given that I didn't exactly go into Electric Lady with the highest hopes because a great deal of the material on this project is from American Dream just as the London session CD the band dropped in 2010 right after there this is happening record was chock-full of material from around that era in the band's career Electric Lady also features recordings of a few throwbacks from the band's discography and a handful of covers as well that range in terms of adherence to the original blueprint the band's take on the Human League seconds on the opening track of this thing sounds like a dead ringer for the original outside of James Murphy's vocals and the slightly more distorted instrumentation as far as the pacing and the tempo and the overall composition of lcds version here it's like Carbon Copy meanwhile their take on sheiks I want your love is a lot faster more tense than the very sensual original the band kind of throws out the laid-back and disco inspired grooves of that cut and replaces it with something a lot more wiry and energetic and kind of intentionally awkward and weird and the band's take on we don't need this fascist groove thing from heaven 17 is maybe the best cover of the bunch just by virtue of LCD soundsystem sounding most in their element while playing it between the political ear saying the cheeky group vocals as well as the groove it's like this track was made for LCD Soundsystem to cover it and again the rest of the material on this thing it's just pretty much session renditions of tracks from American dream and I think your enjoyment of this project is going to be greatly predicated on your enjoyment of that album although I honestly can't say it bothered me all that much meaning that I prefer a lot of the session versions of these tracks to the originals honestly because again I thought the performance is on American Dream were kind of boring and just really lacking in energy or whom the mix was consistently washed out and messy meanwhile tracks like call the police on electric lady are presented in a much more raw and naked fashion I however do not prefer the session versions of you wanted to hit and get innocuous on electric lady to the studio originals there's not much in my opinion honestly that can match the beauty and the color and the ecstasy of the production quality on sound of silver and this is happening but still I'll take the session versions of tonight and emotional haircut any day over the recordings on American Dream now given that these are live versions of these tracks just putting these songs into a session and recording it does little to nothing about the subpar writing of the material on American Dream as LCD soundsystem pretty much just you know plays it pretty straight to the original versions of the tracks so tracks from that album that took forever to develop and we're really boring and utterly redundant like I used to as well as oh baby which has a really weird track listing placement on this record that utterly ruins the flow yeah while I may enjoy the more organic and in the moment performances of these tracks to their studio version originals still I I do find the writing to be utterly boring so I don't know I'm not really sure what else I can say about this record I think it's pretty decent obviously it's not a live version of American Dream all the way through it's just got some material from it mixed with some covers and older stuff from the band's career so while there is some material on this record I don't really care for it feels a little unfair to purely judge this record based on its writing and the substance of the material because I already knew the quality of it going into it because I had heard the studio versions a while ago but if what this record is supposed to do is make us recontextualize or listen to these songs in a different way because of the performance aspect of hearing the band play them out live in the studio I would say it succeeds on that front to a decent degree as a few of the Bands older cuts and the covers are merely just ok much of the American Dream material is greatly improved by these recordings the performances are pretty tight the grooves are pretty good there are some points where I find the mix to be a little too crunchy or trebly but when the band really does lay on the layers of chaotic instrumentation and and reaches a point of chaotic climax it does have a very satisfying sound so overall I do think this is a pretty solid session CD again prefer to American Dream wouldn't necessarily say I think it bests the London sessions though and it definitely leaves me looking forward to whatever LCD Soundsystem is going to be doing in the future as even their least impressive material today sounds greatly improved with a more muscular and defined recording and more lively performances if they can manage to nail at least that on the next record it's going to blow American dream out of the water no question I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to

VCGwCQDMEi8,ah hi everyone sexy guys you know here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new panda bear album Buies this is the newest full-length album from singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist producer mr. panda bear known for his time in the groundbreaking neo psych outfit animal collective panda bear has also built up a pretty impressive solo discography for himself over the years however I've never considered myself a hardcore Animal Collective fanboy and maybe because of this I've never really been as into the solo material as many other people have been outside of panda bears person pitch and of course deacons sleep cycle that is a sweet record and I didn't exactly go into buoys with super high hopes especially since the lead single off of the record dolphin in my opinion is such a train wreck with its obnoxious water sound effects the stale percussive sequences that endlessly repeat like water torture as well as some very goofy vocals it's like the track is set to a tempo that forces panda bear to slow motion but surprisingly enough beyond the singles deeper into the record this album actually has a lot of weird endearing qualities to it that I like overall bouys is not nearly as soulless lis repetitive or as mind-numbing as panda bears past couple of releases much of the material on this record feels like it's being presented in a pretty raw form it's not nearly as dolled up and washed out and labored over it's also a pretty organic listen to it feels almost as if everything I'm hearing is occurring live right there in the moment and even with the very limited sound palette panda bear is working with on this one he does still create a very strong sense of place on these tracks I feel like I'm existing in whatever weird psychedelic space or plain panda bear is also in as I'm listening to him perform these cuts whether it be on the song cranked which features these cavernous delay is just swallowing these Lofa searing laser synthesizers these sounds are just continually crashing into each other and the intensity of that only increases as the song progresses the song crescendo does a much better job of working with a lot of the same water sounds the opening track dolphin did the tracks glitchy sounds and heavy sub bass gives me the feeling of being submerged this track is also set against a much better song than dolphin 2 though it's it's not saying much even if I'm not super in love with this record what I do like about it more than some of panda bears other albums is that it feels like he's actively trying to engage the listener with some really creative and live sound play instead of lowing them into a stupor and under a lot of this sound play he's bringing actual songs not just indulgent navel-gazing set to a couple of never-ending chord changes I think if it were played at a faster tempo with more straightforward backing instrumentation the track token could be a song that peels - a lot of fans outside the animal collective camp and at its core I think the title track of this thing has a driving folky quality to it with really surreal lyrics it almost reminds me of like a Neutral Milk Hotel track with panda bear obviously coming to a much different aesthetic conclusion with the whooshing waves of distorted noise the envelope it erpaderp percussion and the guitar just soaked in delay meanwhile the track inner monologue also feels like a throwback but to a time of folk music in the late 60s early 70s like just very lonely balladry with a lot of atmosphere and sad instrumental accompaniment a strange sample of like a crying girl some subtly droning layers what sounds like a sad warped reed instrument playing out in the background and some weirdly soulful vocal harmonies - and that's another thing I shouldn't mention about this LP a lot of panda bear singing it's a little unlike with fans might be used to on previous records whether it be solo material or animal collective stuff because his voice while it is soaked in delay it's not really being covered or veiled in any walls or layers or anything it's very naked it's very straightforward he does engage in some very weird intentionally weird vocal inflections many of which sound kind of contorted and to the point where I do think of ruins some of these tracks slightly however there is part of me that does appreciate the weird vocal risks he's trying to take on this record and there are tracks that the sound play and the song quality is so good that whatever weirdo vocal stuff panda bear might be doing it kind of shines past that or I just ended up embracing or enjoying the weird quirky vocal qualities of a certain track so by virtue of those vocals and some of the sonic experiments on this record I don't think buoys is going to be for all panda bear and Animal Collective fans this is very much going to be a project that appeals to a very small group within that crowd I could especially see moments like the closing track on here rubbing fans the wrong way with multiple sounds in the mix being set on these different disorienting delays that don't quite sync up and as the instrumentation intensifies the mix only gets more dizzying so there are some bits of this record that are challenging and there are honestly some low points as well tracks where you either have a boring tune or a stale progression the song master is one of the longest and most painfully redundant tracks on the entire record I mean I'm glad overall bouys sees panda bear drifting away a little bit from that headache-inducing repetition but there's still some moments here where he seems to continue embracing that I also like many of the romantic and slice-of-life lyrics throughout this record there are quite a few moments where panda bears referencing reconnecting and turning off your phone's screen essentially living more in the moment I guess overall I thought this is a very fun trippy little alternative full psych record with sure some glaring flaws but also a lot of character and a lot of creativity I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition have you given this record listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana panda bear buoys forever 
VWjFquNG1IY,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new ariana grande album thank you next this is the latest full-length LP from one of pops biggest voices right now ariana grande a pretty quick follow-up to her fourth full-length album that dropped this past summer sweetener which had its highs and it's lows but in my opinion up until that point it had been her best album yet especially with its quirky and forward-thinking production from the likes of Pharrell as well as super strong standout singles like God is a woman thank you next though boasts no production for mr. Williams which is kind of sad but Pharrell's beats did lead to a little bit of stylistic inconsistency on Ariana's last full-length LP that's fortunately not the case here pretty much all the instrumentals on thank you next are a seamless blend of low-key electro pop blissful ambience and smooth spacious trap overall it's a much more uniform record even though ariana is working still with a notion of producers and co songwriters the most prominent of which are Swedish pop wizard Max Martin Andrew when sell as well as Victoria Monet who's written for everyone from nazhde fifth harmony and all this contributes to thank you next being a pretty moody record even this album's most blatant bops are delivered in a kind of relaxed fashion or are veiling hidden sadness or something so Ariane is definitely approaching this new record with a different sound a different attitude and even though this record might represent a pretty quick turnaround and transition that's partially because it's almost like it's been a lifetime since Ariana's last record at least in terms of life-changing events as she broke off her engagement with Pete Davidson Mac Miller who she was with in one of her longest and closest relationships passed away and unfortunately a lot of listeners especially American ones are quick to forget the Manchester bombing the negative effects of which still loom over ariana today may be that partially has to do with Ariana putting on such a brave face after which sweeteners seem to be to some degree but I'm thank you next it's like all of these negative experiences are finally compiling to a point where she can't pretend it's not getting to her anymore and now all of this stress is manifest itself in some really negative behaviors for Ariana that she's trying to address here because thank you next isn't so much about addressing or changing route problems but really kind of head on facing what you're doing as a result of these problems whether it be coming off really really needy or needing to cut off some friend with benefits because you don't want them in your blood line anymore maybe you realize this relationship or connection isn't that good for you Arianna goes on about needing to put on fake smiles and pretending she's okay being addicted to shopping trying to forget her past and also getting caught up in some really weird love triangles like on ghosts and where she finds herself having feelings for someone else and also the closing track break up with your girlfriend I'm bored it's a good title due to all the introspective and personal themes throughout this album this is easily ariana grande's most vulnerable record yet and honestly it's kind of depressing for a pop record but for such a dark release it does kick off with a very heavenly opener the song imagine it's this really smooth idyllic R&B jam and 3/4 essentially about being in this really blissful honeymoon stage with a guy it's not the most distinct track on here but it does have some sweet and nimble vocal lines and essentially comes off like a really vivid fantasy that ariana is longing for the track also hits this really grand instrumental finish with some strings and some pianos and ariana reaches up into her vocal register and pulls off like these these super insane octaves that sound like a whistle or maybe even like a throwback to the kind of vocal acrobatics Mariah Carey used to do back in the day like reaching up into frequencies only dolphins could hear the record immediately goes into way more somber territory with the song needy who's instrumental sounds like it's being played out by the lonely keys of a toy piano from the ghost dimension the song never really picks up the pace or gains a strong beat and it doesn't need it Ariana sings with a lot of passion and conviction on this track and the tune is strong enough that it still shines through and is incredibly catchy in the super minimalist state the song NASA has a pretty cute hook but it's one of several tracks on here that strikes me as maybe a little generic or one-dimensional for me it sort of fits into a growing ocean of tracks that feature female singer gently crooning over dusty beats with serene sense and generous sub-base I kind of feel the same way about the song in my head as well even if I do like the narrative of ariana grande tricking herself into a relationship where she imagines the guy she's with is being greater than he actually is or someone that he's not and meanwhile the song makeup is an idea for a track that I like a lot likening her enjoyment of making up in a relationship to literal makeup that she likes to wear the quirky instrumental is great I love the chirpy vocal harmonies that kind of remind me of something off of the old Dirty Projectors record but the abrupt finish and the barely-there structure of the song leads me to believe that they didn't really know what to do with it which is mega unfortunate because it's one of the most fun and unique tracks on the entire record still though the rest of the album is pretty solid I love the electro and reggae fusion of the track bloodline the track hits hard it's produced incredibly well in Ariana's vocals come off really authoritative it's easily one of the boldest songs on the entire record from the beat to the horns it's a very heavy and sexy track and while I do like the couple of tracks on this record that hit hard it's really the more dreary spots on this thing that win me over the song fakes smile in my opinion is fantastic not only for its smart revision of the wu-tang song tears and I know this isn't a cover but the song borrows from the same sample of the song after laughter comes tears and the way that sample is chopped up in place throughout this track over here it leads me to believe that that original wu-tang cut was was a huge inspiration the vibe of Ariana's song is absolutely chilling especially as she breaks out these really breathy and frosty vocal lines on the hook and the lyrics of this track frankly are kind of cutting like it really gets to some painfully sad emotions about ariana just not being able to fake feeling okay at this point it's a sad reminder of how many people day in and day out are forced into a position where you have to essentially just not break down not fall apart despite everything around you pushing you to do exactly that the song ghostin is yet another powerful but also beatless ballad we're Arianna almost sounds like she's singing from a dream state or like purgatory or something as her voice is just wrapped in all of these pillowy but warped layers of sense it's very atmospheric it's very new agey almost ambient the song also reaches this wonderful climax of pure bliss in the second-leg despite the lyrics telling a kind of different emotional story as far as the ending of the album goes it finishes pretty strong the song seven rings while it did under well me at first it has grown on me in the context of the record a little bit I think the beat is immaculate and pristine I love Ariana's interpolation of my favorite things into the melody of the opener I like the Biggie nod on the track and the song's message of buying in retail essentially as like an emotional crutch is much clearer in the context of this entire record which is all about crutches and all about just not being able to deal emotionally and even though ariana does pull from some pretty obvious places for inspiration on this track ultimately I think it's catchy I think it's a solid song and the statement she's making with it clearly comes from a pretty personal place the song thank you next serves as a pretty decent tie up for the record it's like a triumphant look back on a bunch of relationships that impacted Ariana emotionally romantic connections that didn't work out but she still learned from and grew from admittedly I didn't really think all that much of the track at first as it seemed kind of bare-bones maybe a little rushed I admit I wasn't super crazy about the track when I first heard it but toward the finish of this record I think it brings a great sense of closure it's got a kind of celebratory tone that is very much needed at the end of all of these very dark and very moody cuts and it sees ariana reaching like a point of acceptance when it comes to all of this stress and anguish and sadness that has come as a result of everything that's been happening to her recently but then she sort of throws herself back into that drama with the closing track break up with your girlfriend I'm bored it's like she's gone over very methodically every issue that she's having on this album but then at the very end goes on to realize that you know I'm still gonna be that girl who makes a bad decision that I'm gonna regret later which I mean I guess that's just humanity so with this album I'm happy to port that sweetener is no longer my favorite ariana grande record and now thank you next is my favorite ariana grande record it's got a really solid set of tunes no gigantic duds like there were a few of on sweetener the instrumental palette is super consistent and tasteful and textured and colorful and creative as well as trendy but without sounding too stale or run-of-the-mill the emotional themes throughout the record while not linear they do paint a picture and tell a story and a very personal one at that more personal than I thought ariana grande wouldn't get on an album honestly I mean sure maybe the record overall is a little bit dreary and maybe there are a few spots that could have been a bit more ambitious or epic but honestly I think this is really well produced and well put together pop record that flows fantastically and is easily Ariana Grande's most impressive release yet I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you

zjWQ2qiJH8E,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and yeah we're here Grammy's 2019 recap the Grammys happen whoo whoo music's biggest night people want Awards as usual that's what happens at the Grammys from what I saw there were actually some pretty cool performances post Malone teaming up with Red Hot Chili Peppers is not something you see every day and Janelle monáe's dirty computer medley based off of the make me feel single was pretty fun also Tara whack looked amazing but what I'm gonna do here is file over the winners and the various categories that I talked about in my Grammys predictions video so yeah let's let's go and see what triumphs and disappointments the Grammys offered this year so for Best R&B album her one which is is totally fine I mean not super crazy about her but I think the choice could have been worse they're next on best country album Kacey Musgraves one and that is absolutely not a surprise whatsoever personally preferred the Chris Stapleton album but Casey really was the runaway train that dominated the country conversation this year and her crossover appeal has been like gigantic and sure that appeal has come at the sacrifice of a more authentic and routier country sound but I don't know at the end of the day what Casey does it's it's a lot better than bro country album of the year I don't know man I think the Janelle Monae record is so much better I enjoy the post Malone record more than Casey's and I obviously enjoy the cardi B record more than Casey's but I could see why the Academy would enjoy Casey's record more cuz it's deeper it's more emotional it's more personal but still man Golden Hour / dirty computer just feels like feels like blasphemy record of the year went to Childish Gambino's this is America I mean that's my song of the year for last year so I can't really complain song of the year also this is America Best Pop solo performance lady gaga jo-ann where do you think you're going not my favorite track in that category actually surprised it didn't go to ariana grande but what are you gonna do Best Pop Vocal album goes to ariana grande happy that happened not displeased about that and not surprised as I do think it is the best record in that bunch and the only person who really could have brought ariana any competition in this field would have been Taylor Swift but her new record was trash so Best Pop duo/group Performance we have Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper not my favorite in this list but you know shallow and a star is born is just like this gigantic cultural force that you just can't seem to get away from so again not not surprised invasion of privacy cardi B best rap album which people have been making a big deal of because it's it's symbolic first female solo rapper to win in this category and that's all well and good but I don't know man I I think the push a tee Daytona record is is a much stronger album in fact I I think like nine out of ten hip hop heads would agree but you know once more the Grammys sort of shows that it doesn't really sort of celebrate hip hop for the same reasons that people have been listening to hip hop like all their lives celebrate it and then they just sort of sit here and they wonder why Drake and childish gambino and Kendrick won't perform at their award show but honestly this award going to cardi is not the worst thing that could happen this is not as much an upset as like an award in this category going to McLemore / Kendrick Lamar and this year the pics in this category on the whole were better than they've been at previous award ceremonies so and then best rap song goes to God's plan / sicko mode / sicko mode hate to sound like a white guy with glasses but you know / sicko mode best country song Kacey Musgraves won that one okay that's fine to be predicted best R&B performance it seems like those who were voting for the Grammys were pretty with her so of course she walked away in that category as well with her cut featuring Daniel Caesar in the dance and electronic music field the best album it goes to justices woman worldwide which I mean I'm not generally against justice it's better to see them taking an award in this category than like the chainsmokers or something like that but to put this record over John Hopkins singularity and Sophie's oil of every pearls on insides why why that's such a good record best rock performance when bad does good by Chris Cornell that's that's totally fair totally fine don't dislike that pic best metal performance yes winner electric Messiah by high on fire yes take that Trivium take that under oath take that death heaven stands between the buried in meteor you're fine you just didn't get the award I'm sorry but high on fire that they are the best band in this category if you don't think so you're wrong okay you're just wrong at best rock song we have mass seduction Jack Antonoff and Annie Clark yay st. Vincent ei Greta Van Fleet in twenty one pilots didn't get it whoo honestly there were some really good picks in this category I mean ghost is a good pick the mantra track from bringing me the horizon is a good pick jump suit is a good pick it's it's not a bad category it's really great to see st. Vincent walk away with the award because it is a decent record and she is a very talented artist who I think has been long overdue for these kinds of accolades best alternative music album ah why Beck colors not utopia by Bjork I also would have accepted American utopia by David Byrne I would have accepted that too and even freaking mass seduction by Saint Vincent hell the Arctic Monkeys record was better than Beck's colors and that album is a total mess that there's really like a contingent of people who will just vote for Beck no matter what he does at the Grammys and I have no idea why seem LMA won best R&B song which is not that surprising considering how huge that track was this year and also for traditional R&B performance there was a tie between Leon bridges as well as PJ Morton which is okay I suppose best urban contemporary record winner everything is loved by the Carters which I guess I'm I'm fine with that I wasn't really huge on many of the picks in that category best rap performance was also a tie how many sister kissers are there gonna be this year King is dead by Kendrick Lamar j-rock and future with James Blake and also bubblin by Anderson Peck I don't know if the Grammys just give you like two awards when you get a tire or something I'm not exactly sure I think it's pretty obvious bubblin is a much better track than King's dead but I'm glad it got in there in the tie I'm not even mad the sicko mode didn't win because bubbling is a pretty badass song good for Anderson PAC good for Anderson shout out to Anderson the true best teeth in the game best rapped some performance we had this is America childish game you know will another one another one up there that's quite nice would have been really cool to maybe see it go to rock star since I think that's also an excellent song and you know also shout-out to 21 savage hopefully he is free and back to doing what he is doing really soon it's absolutely disgusting best solo country performance Kacey Musgraves she is really just runnin down this list best reggae album goes to the collaborative sting and Shaggy record why wouldn't it I don't even listen to that much new reggae and I know that that's not the best reggae album best children's album all the sounds by Lucy clan tari and the jazz cats yes yes yes yes yes and we have in the package category the best recording package mass seduction art director willow perrilyn Saint Vincent what do you guys trying to say best recording package perverts also the best box or limited-edition package did go to weird al' yankovic which is actually pretty amazing hell yeah and best music video also went to this is America which not surprising is that is an amazing music video though kind of sad to see that it did not go to Janelle Monae because pink that is very fun music video - very fun actually very sad Janelle Monae didn't get any Grammys very sad about that so it's not like this year's Grammys didn't come with absolutely no disappointments there were some but overall I don't know it wasn't the worst this year I guess the Grammys were okay they weren't so bad that I would violently throw up all over myself but they were just good enough to the point where I will continue feigning interest in them whatever Grammy season ends up coming around but you know that's just award shows in general they're all supposed to make us just feel bad about ourselves yeah so until next time my little Grammys is anthony Fantana signing off Grammy number one reporter and the best teeth in the game transition have you given these Grammys a listen did you love them too did you hate them what would you rate them you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana music Grammys forever

Bandcamp now that you guys can listen to the link is down below along with all of the other music I'm going to be talking about in this episode all right the worst tracks what are the worst tracks of the week in my opinion the worst tracks the tracks have stood out to me the worst as the worst the worst of the world all along what are they first off we have Russ dropping an acoustic version of the song missing you crazy sounds terrible incredibly dry mix really stiff performance if you can even call it that the singing and rapping are pretty bland the acoustic bits that don't even sound performed live are really twinkly but very bland and boring moving on from there Pet Shop Boys the legendary New Wave and synth pop duo they are back with a brand new single on social media attached to a music video as well and it's only February 20 19 and this literally has the potential to be contender for the worst song that I've heard all year you know I could kind of see what they're trying to do thumb attica ly with this one in that they are trying to focus on social media and they are explaining a lot of things about social media quite literally in the way that a group like Kraftwerk might back in the day I'm like an older track that was more of a topical one but really I think the lyrics are I guess not too blunt but maybe they over explain a bit too much and they're quite obnoxious also the the singing in the vocal line and the rhythm of the track is totally off the sensor stale and boring the tune is totally flavorless I'm just not a really into this at all and the track is so long-winded as well or at least it feels like it lasts forever really by 30 seconds in this song I already felt like kind of an eternity and you knew pretty much everything that was going to do for the rest of it yeah this this is this is quite frightening this is frightening and incredibly disappointing I mean not that Pet Shop Boys have been putting out their best stuff lately but you know a group with their history and profile should not be putting out music of this quality you know I could I could see how a lot of characteristics of this track could be totally intentional but I don't think it went over well moving on from their new collaborative cut from the chainsmokers and 5 seconds of summer who do you love and yeah just pretty much sounds like a bad piece of dance pop punk millennial pop with whoa whoa I can't I can't stand it it's it's yeah it's giving me the sneezes it's giving me the sneezes actually the tears coming out of this man's face this is exactly how I look when listening to this track and also no believe it or not this is not like a weird CD insert that you might have gotten buying an overpriced you know disc at your local FYE circa 2004 no this is actually like the the front cover of a new single from Beck featuring Robin in the Lonely Island for the lego movie to soundtrack and yeah it's it's an absolutely horrendous song easily one of the most annoying things that we're we are going to hear this year without question and I don't even want to dwell on it referred to any longer than that all right man the tracks that I was not blown away by but I certainly thought were worth mentioning first off we have another cut from the lego movie to soundtrack it's actually a song from the indie electronic everything supergroup known as super organism yes they have a song on the Lego 2 soundtrack it is kind of annoying you know not as annoying as the Beck track but still a little annoying but still it does kind of have those quirky fun catchy qualities that we typically love about superorganisms music you know just some of those synth sound like dying cats and some of the background vocals sound obnoxiously zany but still this track hello me and you it's it's not that bad moving on from there ratso aka Larry Sloman author longtime author apparently is coming out with his first record and Nick Cave is featured on the title track of all things obviously there's a connection there why wouldn't there be if Nick Cave was just showing up on the track the track is a little Coen ish it's a very sad ballad it's kind of rickety but the Nick Cave passages are quite nice it's been a while since I've heard him perform or sort of appear on a song that kind of sets this tone so it's it's pretty nice it's pretty nice you know not blowing me away but it is a nice listen moving on from there these new Puritans have a brand new single out anti-gravity I've never been a big period ins guy this track to me as usual sound strange doesn't do too much for me but it certainly sounds out there so if you want something out there go ahead go ahead it'll it'll definitely bend your brain migos position to win brand-new single yeah it's it's okay I think DJ Darrell's instrumental on this one really carries a lot of the weight of the track as it does hit pretty hard it's got a lot of awesome textures in it it's always shifting so it prevents the song from getting stale even if the trio isn't really going above and beyond vocally they do sit on the relatively catchy hook pretty hard so yeah it's it's not like one of their best tracks I've ever heard but it's certainly a step up from the wash rinse and repeat drivel that they have been putting out as of late so yeah position to win it's not too bad moving on from there Khaled has a brand new single is well it's his a usual brand of very smooth and slick and modern R&B but there's a nice synth funk aesthetic to some of the instrumentation in the background it brings a good groove and a nice kind of you know pastel neon like flavored aesthetic to it that's a little bit of a throwback it's quite nice moving on from their abyss on machine also on a bit of a synth funk kick with this brand new single or teaser track over here name of this one is want to come down it wasn't as crazy about the groove on this one but but still it is nice to hear the band switching it up a bit moving on from there Fontaine's DC Irish post-punk outfit Fontaine's DC drop a new single and a music video the track big is pretty fun it's short it's sweet it's to the point it's a pretty compelling the kid in the music video is cute as hell and yeah you know it's it's driving not my favorite song that I've heard from these guys so far but everything they've put out thus far does does lead me to feel like hey these this is a band to look out for you know they got some personality they got some raw performances you know they're kind of straightforward and they got these wordy lyrics and everything so many characteristics I love in a good post-punk group and let's get into the tracks I thought were the best the best best best best best this week quite a few of those so be in tune here be in tune this first track and single over here comes from the band wand the name of the cut is scarecrow previously I've never really been that big into wand I've always found them to be just kind of a another dime a dozen fuzzy scuzzy punky garages psyche influenced outfit that didn't really stand out to me all that much however this new track over here they totally change gears into something much groove here more ballad based it does take a little while to get started this is a very patient slow-burning track but I do love the powerfully despondent song that they deliver on this one and the sound play that the band is engaged for years really does pay off because there are some really creative in subtle ways that they paint this very dreary ballad with strange little guitar Plex and plucks and weird swishy psyche dark depressing noises just kind of hanging in the background still a little burnt out give me a break moving on from there Oliver tree has a music video out for the track herd which is not a brand new single it's been out a little bit I think it dropped just the very tail end of last year as a single but the music video is amazing it's already racked up like millions of views for the dude it's hilarious it's creative the song is catchy I love how this guy is continuing you sound super refreshing and cutting-edge but also really throwing it back to the 90s during this time in the era when you had these really creative fusions of rock and electronic and pop and hip-hop music because it really does feel indebted to that and and again like if you're not hip to this dude's memes and his style and his sound and everything so far like God Oliver tree is the future Oliver tree is the future okay Oliver tree is the future moving on from there we have this brand excuse me oh yeah this brand new cut over here from a singer previous to this I was unfamiliar with her name is Thelma that's sort of the name she goes by and stranger love is the name of this new cut attached to a very well shot and executed music video that kind of reminds me of like a I don't know a quirky hipster pastel colored Napoleon Dynamite or something like that so there is something kind of funny and and silly about the look of it and just kind of the progression in the video but the tune itself is is actually a kind of sad and amazingly sad and the vocals are quite I guess they're they're amateurish but really beautiful and compelling I love the simplicity of the song and and I think that it progresses really well despite being as simple as it is very emotionally captivating and I will be looking forward to hearing more music from Thelma in the future moving on from there I want to give a shout out to LCD soundsystem electric lady sessions link down below is a human league cover from the record I do like it quite a bit not going to talk about it that much more though because I'm going to be reviewing this record this week so you will be hearing my thoughts on this song and more as soon as my review for this drops moving on from there foxes in they are back they have a brand new song out of course it sounds little Rolling Stones ish but it's still a beautiful tune with a great instrumental a good vocal performance it's very tasteful ballad lots of passion and looking forward to hearing the duo's next next bit of evolution you know that there's been a lot of highs and lows across the fox agenda skog Rafi so far but I'm always on the edge of my seat alright moving on from there next one next one a Christian Scott has dropped a beautiful wonderful amazing brand-new single featuring Saul Williams which is an amazing mix of spoken word and jazz fusion the trumpet playing is amazing Williams poetry is fantastic there's not really anything I don't like about the track looking forward to Christian Scott dropping more material this year hopefully it is as riveting as this moving on from there moving on from there Charlie Bliss is back Charlie bliss you guys might remember when I covered the Charlie Bliss record that dropped a little while ago you know it might have felt a little one-dimensional with its 90s throwback aesthetic and the the kind of grungy loaf I feel but the tunes at the core of it were quite sweet and that is also the case for this new cut over here you know that kind of nineties throwback vibe it's still there at the core but the production is better there's more since this time around it's very Cynthia it's kind of dramatic there's more dynamics to it there's more body to it you know the recording is better there's more flavor so you know I feel like the songwriting while it sits still as good shining a little bit more shining a little bit better so a capacity okay is the name of this new song over here give it a listen it's great young enough name of the new record on the way moving on from there shake-up EP is the latest release from kid boo-ki who is a UK rapper he's got a track out well shake-up is the name of the track it's not a brand new track or anything but he does have a new music video out for which has essentially drawn my attention to the track and the dude has an amazing flow lots of personality he's really hilarious he's a total character very off-the-wall you know he I love to hear a rapper out there who can rap well and puts a lot of weird energy into what they're doing you know what I mean and and he's certainly doing that so I got to catch up with with this dude's stuff because you know his character his eccentricities really poured through on this song and I highly recommend that you give it a listen okay this is a great track it's fun okay you're gonna have fun listening to it have fun with this track have fun with it show me the body is back with a weird out there aggressive punky and freakish little track titled camp orchestra does take a little while to get going but once it does get going it is raw and animalistic and awesome show me the  body bro so um yeah I'm not sure what else I can add to it other than that you know it's it's a pretty mean potatoes cut once it really kind of gets into the groove and everything though I do like the the very patience testing intro really kind of gets your mouth salivating gets you waiting for like whoa what's the payoff gonna be and when they finally just punch in with those vocals and guitars and drums it really uh it really does feel quite nice moving on from there Bibby Oh has a brand new record on the way and a cut titled curls and this is actually the first time not the first time well the first time in a long time that I have been moved this deeply by a Bibby attract now Bibby Oh for a while has lived at this cross-section of electronic music but also folk music too and I think this cuz an example of one of those beautiful and just sort of well orchestrated marriages of those two sounds to come out of this project I mean the ballot at the core of it is very fragile and gorgeous and wonderful and captivating and then the subtle electronics that he sort of works traits around the tune at the core of it are just like really compelling and sweet and and touching so um yeah I'm not really sure what I can say about outside of that it's just like a beautiful little tune and I'm looking forward to this video record hell yes and that has been the weekly track round up everybody thank you very much for watching sorry for the coughs but you know I still am a little sick at the moment but again all the songs and

Z9xDiR7v_XA,ah hi everyone feels the editor Tanna know here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new cthis scene mixtape bosky - midwest rapper come at the scene he is back with the follow up B sequel to his boss key tape that dropped last year which has brought him a passionate cult following who also seemed pretty thrilled about this latest project here however I'm not really seeing what's so exciting about this tape listening to this thing I'm pretty surprised that kometa scene is from Illinois and that this thing is new because all this tape really sounds like is something a South Florida rapper would have recorded and uploaded to SoundCloud two years ago maybe there would be an argument for this tape being cutting edge or refreshing had it somehow come out before smoke perps dead star in 2017 but it didn't and as a result the flows and the instrumentals on Bosque - even some of the vocal inflections that come at the scene brings to the table on this thing are all pretty stale and blatantly unoriginal and not only are so many of the sounds and the ideas on this project stale but come at the scene does so little to put his own spin on any of it I mean sometimes his lyrics can get annoyingly edgy where he's basically trying way too hard to sound threatening and aggressive without even trying to balance it out a little bit with some wit or humor or absurdity or self-awareness all that come at the scene really offers lyrically on this record is just unadulterated posturing and that's it sometimes his hooks can be kind of infectious and ridiculous like a Benjamin counter benjamin counter first name Benjamin last name counter but the songwriting on this thing generally is not really anything to brag about because a lot of the songs kind of cut out before the two-minute mark even comes through preventing many of these tracks from leaving a lasting impact and don't get me wrong there's nothing inherently bad about short songs a lot of cool stuff can happen in one minute and 45 seconds but come at the scene doesn't really provide anything all that sticky or interesting within that very short time frame you would much rather get by with generic gangster isms and just heaps of aggression over these somewhat left-field trap beats and I will give it to this guy he does have an ear for great production I mean his biggest hits so far Walken is hugely indebted to the futuristic instrumental it's attached to but it's not like the beats on this thing are so cutting-edge that they actually become a selling point they just give commit the scenes versus a somewhat weird backdrop and that's about it this thing is ten tracks it's 17 minutes vapid lyrics trendy flows pretty much the same formula repeated for one track after another track after another track there's really not a whole lot to pick over on this terribly uninteresting project and it really left no impressions on me whatsoever outside of just feeling generally worked and sure while it's not the worst project I'm going to hear all year it is utterly forgettable in the worst way imaginable I'm feeling a decent too strong for on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i RV next hit the life you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that abord link to subscribe to the channel anthony Fantan oh come at the scene forever 
asIkx9NJs7o,ah hi everyone fever channel here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Maggie Rogers record heard it in a past life singer-songwriter and producer Miss Maggie Rogers she has a new full-length album out over here she is coming in hot with a lot of promo despite only recently dropping a big commercial album with Capitol Records Maggie's artistic trajectory has been heavily documented as if music audiences have been following her every move up until this point you can go online and read endlessly about everything from what she used to listen to when she was younger to the Berklee music program that she won a a songwriting award with dropping a few albums independently and auditioning a song for Pharrell that literally brought him to two years it's okay to cry at me I'm too sick for this right now you're just ashamed of your emotions I hate to see it it kills me then there's Maggie's label signing her fledgling hit her SNL appearance it's been a very guided rise to prominence which you know what is fine I honestly wish today's music industry did more to invest in up-and-coming artists as opposed to ambulance-chasing every single viral internet hit and knowing that's the current state of things I went into this record assuming that Maggie has something special and substantive something that doesn't quite translate to the mimetic passageways that most music is promoted through today Plus this LP did get number 2 on the Billboard Top 200 even if it was released super early in the year and only moved very modest 37 thousand copies I'm also pretty delighted to see talented names like Greg Kurstin in on the production of this record on some key tracks but overall the sound and the style and the aesthetic of this record it's kind of a hodgepodge it has the synthetic grooves of a synth pop album but also the relatability of like a folk or a singer-songwriter record there's also a low-key sensuality to it like a classic sophisticated degree there are also some tracks on this thing that are pretty anthemic and grandiose which feels like yet another nod to the 80s especially on the closing track here there's also a few points on this record where I can tell Maggie is pulling pretty directly from heavy-hitters out of the huge wave of female singer-songwriters that were banging the charts in the 90s and finally I think there's something about Maggie's sound that would really appeal to Higham fans the super funky and poppy guitar and bass based sound coming out of some of the songs on this record it really does feel like something off of a high amount but I do like the very danceable and moody and sexy production surrounding a lot of these tracks if anything the beats and the instrumentals on this thing they really are a huge selling point like the plucky bass line and nocturnal atmosphere and swaying groove of the knife the song over night is similarly moonlit and sad and I guess romantic the track also exudes the kind of cinematic depression you can only afford to soak in if you have nothing else wrong going on in your life the tracks say it feels like a bit of a throwback to an old-school 90s R&B jam but with some production updates some bubbly arpeggios probably my favorite track on here as it's attached to one of the best tunes on the record - but the instrumentation and the mixing across this entire record it's not amazing there are some points where it comes off very shoddy like on the opening track give a little which has a complete lack it's totally devoid of like any appealing melodies the lead vocal melody that Maggie is singing on the opening verse of this track it's absolutely mind-bending as to why somebody would record this and save it like most of everything else on this track it sounds totally thrown together and just on this song to pad out time around the chorus which is actually pretty decent there are also some tracks on here that are just drowning in this overly sentimental vibe like light on which kind of runs like Bruce Springsteen at his worst fuse with V cheese wake me up there's also a total loss of personality at some points on this thing like on the piano ballad from this record past life which in some moment sounds like a really off Jewell or Regina Spektor impression plus this song is one of the few moments on this LP where Maggie just seems to overcome with emotion to worry about whether or not she's straining vocally or articulating the words she's actually saying it just feels very performative which I understand Allmusic is to some degree but I feel like the key to a great performance is to trick the audience into thinking that what you're doing there in front of the lenses and the lights it's all natural I can't say Maggie has gotten over that hump though but even when Maggie is at her best vocally on this album her singing is still pretty average I could not honestly pick her voice out of a lineup if you made me there are also a few eyebrow-raising instrumentals on this LP that I just can't really get my head around like the song on/off which features this really heavy sub bass and skipping pianos and weird sound effects it sounds like what you would do if you tried to remix a bunch of pieces from an old OneNote Rick's point never track into a pop tune but the results were not satisfying at all and then we had the super chunky beats and sad piano chords on the cut fallingwater which basically feels like what would happen if you gave a generic Macklemore guest singer the opportunity to just do a full song by themselves my ears throughout this track we're stinging with anticipation for the moment Macklemore was gonna pop in and start whisper rapping about like white privilege or his ice cream hitting the ground then there's also the super over driven and distorted beat on the cut burning which literally does sound like burning there are some quite horrid points on this instrumental that I can't believe nobody attached to this record heard this and thought you know this this is like an opportunity for a redo I mean the production being this much of a mess is not the case for every song on this record but it happens enough times to ruin the overall experience pretty heavily Plus this record is also pretty short on memorable songwriting personality coming out of the vocals past life does have it's bright spots but they're mostly predicated on the instrumental being really danceable and lush like on the cut retrograde meanwhile more low-key cuts on this thing like Alaska are so faint it's like the song thrives off of this really vague quirk that doesn't really get appealing until the hook but I think I'm gonna leave it at that I dislike this record quite a bit way more misses than hits on this thing definitely there are points on this thing that are super average super uninteresting risks that don't really pay off but above all else despite the gargantuan sense of drama being injected into multiple tracks here it's just boring feeling a strong three to a four on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel hit the notification Bell and don't miss a single piece of content and we will see you guys in the next one Anthony Fantana Maggie Rogers forever 
nWwxvvb9uqY,oh hi everyone sicko thinny mode tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the brand-new Beirut Record Gallipoli this is the fifth full-length album from Zac Condon Zone Beirut a band that originated in Santa Fe New Mexico and shook the indie scene well over a decade ago at this point with their novel fusion of indie pop and folk with the sounds of Balkan folk and some brass from the Eastern Bloc generally their sound is pretty charming it's pretty cute and has led to a few very good albums like their debut LP gulag orcas star as well as their follow-up the Flying Club cup which I still have my CD copy of to this day because it's so fun however over the years I have kind of grown less enamored with Beirut sound mostly because their output has just gotten blander and blander on their next full-length LP the Riptide those Balkan folk elements really started to diminish in favor of faux whimsical indie pop and folk which has always been at the core of the band's songwriting to some degree but without that balkan spice to kind of bulk the band's Tunes up their stick deflates pretty quickly the band's next record 2015's nonono was even less satisfying in my opinion I feel like this record was preemptively named after the reaction I had to it as it was just a monstrously average release and despite Zach and his band attempting to get more ambitious on the instrumental side of things with this new LP it's not really much better all because the horns and string sections that you usually hear on a Beirut record are just coming off very uninspired this time around and of course Zac is weaving in and out of these instrumental arrangements with his usual croon with a very romantic affectation on it but I feel like he's just barely meeting the standard that he set for himself on past records though as there's not really a whole lot in terms of emotional conviction to be had on this LP at least I could say his vocal performances on early Beirut records felt a lot less on autopilot and even when his singing wasn't the best what made up for it were these fantastically and femme ik and explosive horn sections an array and again those horns and those strings they are here on this record but it's like their only purpose is to just provide some thickness and volume to give the illusion of compelling progression across the length of these tracks very rarely are any of the horn bits or string bits on this thing even slightly memorable the lackluster instrumentation on this thing is most apparent when we get into the instrumental cuts on this record which I mean if you were going to forgo vocals entirely you would think that's where the compositions would shine but instead we get cuts like on minnow Island which features these sunburnt bright kind of fuzzy synth leads that plot along at an excruciatingly pace or the song Corfu which is named after a Greek island but the vibe of the track sounds more like a ham-fisted attempt at a kind of left-field piece of bossa nova or something with some horror-movie strings at the very end meanwhile the song varieties in exile feels like Beirut trying to recapture their former glory with their usual rollout of some sad little acoustic chords Zac starts crooning and then the instrumentation and everything subtly builds up until you get to the point where you hit the drums and the horns and it's kind of climactic as formulaic as it is it's actually one of the better tracks on here believe it or not those act does work in some sonic surprises on this record that I don't think fans would have anticipated like on the track IG or Dini which compositionally is one of the more tedious Tunes on here but sonically the way the instrumentation bleeds into itself as the track progresses it's a little psychedelic maybe even slightly shoegaze the first time I think I've ever heard a Beirut song that evoked that feeling and the song landslide which did Kirk me at first because I couldn't quite place what exactly a sounded like but the plucky guitar leads along with the sunshine chords that incessantly play throughout much of the track plus the vocal harmonies in the background it feels like he's lifted most of what he's doing here right out of the Pet Sounds playbook but he's trying to apply his usual romantic crooning vocal and songwriting style to it and it's not quite working because the track doesn't progress all that much across its length it's like it's stuck in a perpetual intro state and these are just two songs of quite a few on this record that do bring some decent ideas to the table but any hope of enjoying them long-term is totally mired in how redundant the instrumentation is how stagnant the progressions are how bland the compositions and the vocal melodies are literally some of Zach's most tedious and boring and uninspired vocal melodies turn up on this LP and I'm just not really sure what to say about it I mean there are some moments that I think are kind of okay a few tracks that are somewhat likable but for the most part this is a really tiresome album and Beirut at a point where I'm just like I'm shocked that this was the same band that I enjoyed like a little over a decade ago because this is just so lacking in the romance and the thrill and the sensuality and the Wonder that made Beirut so fantastic to begin with it's just gone even what few moments there are on this thing that kind of harken to a foreign sound or influence it feels like just really bad tourism a little tacky unfortunately which I've never quite felt that way about Beirut stuff even though Zach was filtering these sounds into an indie pop and an indie folk style he very much struck me as a musician who you know really cared about the craft cared about the style cared about the sound did his homework like a Jeremy Barnes and a hawk and a hacksaw but that just does not feel like it's the case on this new LP I'm feeling a decent too strong for on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit

N-tvgRzQIEk,hey hey hey everyone Anthony fan tear though here ah the Internet's most excited music nerd I'm psyched to bust out another weekly track roundup I hope everybody who is watching is doing well and is ready to get turned onto some tracks listen to my opinions on some new songs that have dropped over the past week the best the worst the tracks that fall somewhere in the middle remember all the songs that I bring up are linked down below in the description box and of course I have to give a shout out to the good people over at the ridge wallet they make these nifty minimalist metal plated wallets that fit nice in your front pocket get rid of that disgusting bulky leather wallet support these guys they're keeping my teeth straight all right let's uh let's get into it also we have the Amazon a turntable lab associate links down there treat yourselves especially that turntable a blank get yourselves some colorful vinyl of records we've reviewed on the main channel and you know we get kicked back from it supports the segment supports the channel a few shout outs Karen o has a new cover of bullet with butterfly wings you know the Smashing Pumpkins track off of the Hanna soundtrack also a shout-out to gangsta doodles who are through the power of the amazing doodles that the the brand drops has come together with an amazing little compilation that has not come out fully yet but there is a catch or not a track out now a new cater not a cut out from this compilation that you should definitely definitely definitely check out that is linked down below and you know be on the lookout for a new music from this gangsta gangsta doodles compilation wonderful gangsta doodles book over here and even know if this is available anymore but you know it's so hyped to to have been immortalized in the in the gangsta doodles book myself with my late dog sushi so I'm always a passionate supporter of gangsta doodles now let's get into the tracks I thought were the worst tracks this week quite a few worst tracks quite a few best tracks this week good balance lists let's get into it first this new mark Morton cut some people were asking me about it because I didn't really talk about it last week mark Morton if he didn't know him he's connected to a bunch of different music groups most notably a Lamb of God and also burned the priests and he has some solo material coming out I worked with Chester Bennington actually on this new track over here however I could not really say that I care for it it just sounds like some very over produced groove metal and metalcore and yeah I mean the Chester vocal work is totally cool totally fine but as far as the songwriting just the sound of the music on this one it just sounds very very run-of-the-mill and basic as far as like metalcore and alternative metal ghosts and in my view moving on from their little pump shockingly enough ends up in the worst section off of his brand-new track racks and racks enjoy the video attached to the song which I thought just looked really ridiculous and silly and very tongue-in-cheek and dumb but unfortunately the raw aesthetic that has made little pumps early works so entertaining is completely gone on this new track over here it just sounds really slick really overproduced it does not grimy or nasty or really kind of like I don't know just so messy and sloppy and weird that it kind of has an admirable amateurish quality to it now it just sort of sounds like really mediocre super slickly produced trap like everybody else you know a little pump at first he had a very raw sort of delivery and now it just sort of seems like he's cleaned up to the point where there's nothing really special about him in this track which is honestly very sad and disappointing but you know I guess things are kind of trending in that direction with the increased budget and I guess production quality of everything little pump was probably due in in some point in time to just sound more average in his delivery and sort more measured you know sort of that very amped and totally uninhibited delivery and that very youthful attitude just sort of seems to be sucked out of this new song over here and he almost sounds just like a parody of himself at this point new gonna track which is titled one call and all I really need is one listen of one call to just hear that it's as mediocre average nearly tuneless and forgettable as pretty much every gonna song I've ever heard but not from there Big Boi has a few new tracks out one title doing it with sleepy Brown and another titled return of the dope boy with Killa Mike and backbone and these are a pretty rough couple of tracks I thought that the doing it cut was just a little too slickly produced just way too oriented around an overly saccharine hook and I thought that the killer Mike cut would come through as just being like a little bit more gritty and badass and exciting but it's it's actually even less listenable the the beat is I don't know kind of messy there's not really a whole lot of oomph to it and the the flows and the rapping are kind of mired in you know a little bit of a effects that I think maybe they were trying to make it sound kind of trippy and distant and weird but I think it really only kind of takes away from the listen ability of the track just sounds like a really sloppy mess man these two new tracks did not really have a lot going for them in my view but moving on Andrew bird has a new promotional track out it is titled Sisyphus new record on the way and actually I was absolutely shocked by well not only the cover art over here anybody who's a big fan of archaic paintings but also the the record death consciousness from have a nice life you're familiar with the painting that Andrew bird is actually like re-enacting over here in this photo but this new track Sisyphus that he has dropped sounds like the most blatant father John misty ripoff I've ever heard in my entire life from the drum beat to the chord progression - Andrews vocal delivery I've never heard him sing in this way and also to the type of humour and lyrical imagery in the track it literally just sounds like a bad father John misty impression I'd say the first vocal line actually had me fooled for a second I was like this is Josh this is a new Josh tracker is Josh um like featured on this song but then as Andrew continued to sing in this very Tillman desk demeanor um it became more apparent that it was it was just Andrew and I don't know man I've heard most of this dude's records up until this point he has never sounded like this and it is really just a blatant ripoff of one of his most popular contemporaries and I just don't I don't get where this is coming from this is just not really his style and if he was to go down this road I would hope that he would have put in the effort I don't know put it put his own spin on it just a little bit more but whatever man I I don't I don't get it moving out from there oh boy moving on from there AJR has a brand new track out titled 100 bad days and it's like the most sickening stomach-churning piece of pop music whoo for people who just like need a pillow to cry into after what I don't know like the coffee shop they go to on a regular basis like gets their order wrong or something it's just I can't I just can't alright let's get into the tracks that uh that I thought were kind of meh you know not uh not not not amazing but not terrible either first off in this section we have the brand-new Theophilus London track with tame impala it is title it's whiplash and yeah he pretty much as usual sounds kind of like Kid Cudi but with a very strong vintage like 80s pop flare to his style the hook is pretty strong and tame impalas input into the track isn't that bad I don't think it's one of London's best songs but it's actually pretty decent moving out from there the mountain goats have a brand new cut out title the younger from a brand new album that is on the way after say this is one of the more underwhelming more formless ballads than I think John that I think John has dropped in a while not exactly sure what to say about it as I didn't really find any distinct characteristics about this cut at all I may have to dive a little bit more into the story down the road but did not really grip me as as hard as some leading tracks did from the wrestling theme beat the champ or the music historical document that is Goths but I don't know you know every mountain goats record is a story to tell and an adventure to be had so I guess I'll just kind of hold my full reservations for when I hear the rest of the album next Lou the human rapper Lou the human has a brand new track out titled make you sick I think there are actually some good ideas on this track I like Lou's transition into a grimy er trap instrumentals and everything there are some points where his delivery and his flow sounds pretty weird and and and the word I'm trying to say is dejected it does show promise but I think the structure and just sort of like the the point of this whole track it just comes off very sloppy and disheveled and not really like all that focused on whatever it's trying to get across honestly hoping for something just a bit more I don't know lasered in on to something moving forward going on from there the brand-new posthumous cut from little peep that also features I love Makonnen and Fall Out Boy I've been waiting which I think does have some very catchy qualities to it I think Makonnen and little peep the vocals that are inserted from them onto the hook of this thing is great don't really care from some of the more rock electro elements and the vocals that Fall Out Boy or clearly bringing to the table but I do think there are some admirable aspects to this piece moving on from there Interpol has a nice little sort of post album non album cut titled fine mess that if it didn't make it on to the band's last full-length LP Marauder it easily would have been one of the louder and roar tracks on the records so you know if you're looking for a nice dirty fast me sounding interpol then this might be the track that you want to hear moving on from their higher brothers have a brand new cut out the Chinese hip-hop supergroup are back with a brand new cut that I will link down below as well some awkward bits to the flow on this one but the the hook is pretty raw and it stands out the beat bangs it's it's loud it's in your face it's got a lot of attitude you know I don't think it's the most promising or most you know exciting rap performances that the group have delivered but you know it's it's got a nice grimy raw in-your-face feel to it and Cage the Elephant have a brand new cut out which isn't so great isn't so bad it just kind of feels like a somewhat vintage generic piece of somewhat folky rock music you know it's it's it's an OK ballad not a whole lot of distinct instrumentation to the whole thing its kind of raw on the instrumental side not really an ambitious structure or anything very kind of clear-cut verse chorus verse progressions and yeah I mean again not a bad listen certainly Pleasant but there wasn't really a whole lot about it that that sort of stood out to me Billie Eilish has finally dropped a brand new single has an album release date on the way she is essentially like the it girl in music right now and honestly like I I get the excitement for what she's doing when it comes to the visuals attached to it which are usually pretty weird and forward thinking and very artsy but I'm yet to hear a piece of Billie music that has really blown me away and I've been kind of like waiting for the moment when we hear a single of this promotional magnitude to come out to make like a more definite call and yeah I didn't really find this intriguing in any way shape or form I mean there are some weird and artsy elements to it but the vocals are absolutely boring and the beat which is the most interesting part of all of it it kind of feels like what you would get if you strip back some of the noisier and more abrasive elements from some of the beats off of like Kanye's uses you know which I guess is not the worst influence that that you could have but I don't know the whole sound just feels very average and familiar and just not really as cutting edges I think some people are making it out to be again not awful and certainly open to the idea that once I hear this thing in the context of her entire new album it may blow me away and may sound a little bit better but I don't know just sort of seemed like it wasn't really willing to commit to any bold or memorable ideas and sort of instead decided it was going to sit back hang in the shadows and be a little weird but not so weird that you know your average like pop music listener wouldn't turn it off and and think it's terrible yeah just just sort of seemed like it wanted to sound strange but didn't really want to cross a line into seriously weird and alternate reality honestly so I don't know seems slightly eccentric but not so much that it really grabbed my attention moving on from there av tear of Animal Collective Fame has come back with the song Saturdays again and it sounds like a very trippy indulgent psychedelic fulk Odyssey it has some admirable sounds and textures to it and it is quite meditative but I can't really say a WoW me or got me that that hyped up or anything like that and finally 2 Chainz and Ariana Grande get together and form like Voltron on to this little remix of her brand-new track her brand new song seven rings and two chains doesn't do too bad on the song again not really blown away by the track but hey you know still looking forward to her new album and best tracks best tracks best tracks best tracks the tracks that really kind of grabbed me and excited me the most this week let's go this brand new track from an artist by the name of Zack fluids he teams up with Mick jet this brand new track from an artist that I am new to goes by the name of Zack fluids he has new song out with Mick Jenkins it's titled steps it's pretty badass it's a nice gritty lyrical thoughtful piece of hip-hop very tasteful very fun very cool that is link down below with everything else also rego nasty is back with a brand new single roof it is nasty as fuck I just love her delivery she sounds great the beat is bangin the video is from the future and I'm just loving her energy loving that she's building her songs out just a tad bit more and looking forward to her getting more ambitious on this new record of her she's worked on a ton of new material with Kenny beats and I cannot wait to hear it Kenny sigh the brand-new track from king gizzard and the lizard wizard is an amazing fusion of like what sounds like some Daft Punk future robot sounds with like ZZ Top rock and roll groups sort of built into a pretty long electro rock Odyssey it's kind of weird it's kind of trippy it's very fun it's very entertaining looking forward to seeing where the band is going next with this new sound and aesthetic moving on from there the Japanese band chai who came up with a great little record a few years ago that slipped under my radar are coming back with a new album they have a new single out this one is titled fashionista and it is a very fun cheeky silly piece of Japanese pop and rock that has a lot of eccentric qualities to it looking forward to what they're doing on their new full-length album quite a bit they do have a bit of a punk energy on some of their other tracks maybe not quite so much this one and I hope that doesn't disappear entirely from this new LP moving out from their health have a brand new single out it dropped through the Adult Swim singles program and this one is titled feel nothing kind of liking the very clean voiced dystopian industrial heavy noisy vibe the band is bringing on this new cut over here I've got to say I'm definitely looking forward to a slave's of fear quite a bit then tatianna the legendary blue face cut has gotten a remix with yg I do Blueface and yg did a bit more vocally on this track but it is still a fun quirky song and I think that a Blueface is down the next thing as far as like weirdo rap stars go with very eccentric deliveries and you know I think I think this track is really important as far as eliminating the red and blue divide I think having yg and blue face on a track there is a quite a bit of significance to to that symbolically moving out from there the band black MIDI have a new 12-inch version out along with the remixes of their song Speedway and it's a fantastic little piece of experimental rock with some like dance music and post-punk mixed into there kind of like in their personality it's very despondent it's very strange and somewhat groovy and there's a very organic vibe to the recording of this cut quite a bit this is definitely a UK group that I'm going to be keeping my ear out for over the next year so hell yes - black MIDI and poppy has come through with a brand new single that almost slipped by me this one is titled voicemail and oh my god banger alert banger alert the beat on this thing is insane poppy herself just sounds totally nuts on the lyrics and definitely her weirder vocal aspect sort of coming through on this track yeah just kind of loving every second of this weird ass song where I think that she's really kind of playing into the aesthetic that you get in her YouTube videos a lot more as far as the kind of cheeky weird strange lyrical content the way she delivers her voice how glitchy and abrasive and eerie and freaky the instrumental is I'm liking it quite a bit in the music video is um somewhat nightmarish so definitely enjoying this new cut over here and that is it for the weekly track roundup remember everyone I have linked down below all of the songs that I just talked about

T_D-5p3ENn4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another y-you know a review where I go over a series of records that I wanted to do a full length review of but I didn't got list-style one brief take after another you know what it is by now you know the formula you know what we do so let's get into it transition the BAM this is a follow up collaborative record to the south side and little heard LP that dropped about a year ago at this point in 2018 I wasn't really wowed all that much by that project it felt very smooth very even not a whole lot of standout tracks on it however in comparison still swerving over here is much more raw and energetic I mean there are some tracks that feel maybe a little too thrown together and low Phi and faded and casual on the back end to the point where it is hard to be enthusiastic about them but I am appreciating the much grimy ER vibe of this set of tracks in comparison with with the debut collaborative record if you've been tuning out to a lot of g herbo stuff he's been dropping lately don't miss out on this project because it's pretty decent especially if you're looking for some really grimy nasty Chicago based rap as you guys remember I didn't really care for the last John billion record because of the weird fusion of pop electronic music like Disney movie soundtracks and rap music and yeah I'm still not really a fan of the same blend of electro hip-hop that John Bell Ian draws up on this record - he gets a little more ambitious with some more layered production and he buys himself some legitimacy by you know bringing on some old head type rappers that spit some hard shit on some tracks where the production is actually pretty impressive I have to say if he did an entire record of songs with features from guys like rock Marciano and RZA and so on and so forth and it was just John on the beats throughout the whole thing I would probably like that quite a bit they are the best tracks on the record but once you get off of these cuts and into the you know John Travolta songs it gets absolutely nauseating John just creates the type of pop music that makes my stomach churn and it's way too sugary way too idyllic and I want to have nothing to do with it was originally looking forward to this girl pool album there were a few tracks to using toward it that stood out to me but unfortunately I feel like the duo on this record has drifted away from the quirky and unique songwriting style that permeated their last couple of LPS sure their previous records were a little bit too low Phi definitely not as cleanly put together probably hurt any potential for widespread appeal but now the recording is better and their sound is a bit more agreeable they just kind of sound like another generic jangly indie rock and pop outfit without any personality it's cool that they're making waves and getting a lot of attention because I do think there's some solid tunes on this record there's some decent guitar work but overall the sound is really bland and the standout personality that girl Poole used to be known for is just kind of evaporated [Music] nobody needs this many Zane songs even Zane fans don't want this many songs on stop one of the most popular questions that has been thrown at me over the past year or so has been hey where are you reviewing the new street sex record are you reviewing it why haven't reviewed it yet and honestly as much as I did enjoy the style and the sound they were teasing toward on their last EP the cleanliness new LP over here really hasn't done all that much for me even if I do still like the dark and synthy and post punky vibes and somewhat industrial vibes to coming off of the instrumentals on this record there are moments where the singing on this album it just reminds me like some I don't know watered-down Nine Inch Nails or Marilyn Manson or just like really subpar goth rock which is kind of sad it's it's unfortunate when a record there's one aspect to it that seems to sort of rub you the wrong way to the point where the entire album kind of turns you off and it's difficult to get into the the whole record and that just happens to be the case on this particular album so I don't know those are my thoughts disappointing but I don't think for a lack of effort on street sex part or anything I think the risk and the evolution they presented on this record it's pretty bold I just don't really think it's been clicking with me in 2018 a lot of people were highly anticipating this new Robin album and I guess I was sort of curious as well because it has been so long since she has released a new full-length album maybe she's gonna come back with a new sound or something more bold and exciting I mean certainly daughters did the same thing after waiting a similar timeframe to come out with a new LP but Robin this is easily her most forgettable album these songs are bland like I've never heard so much synth pop that just made me want to go to sleep it's just so unbearably plain I'm not really sure what else to say about it I mean there are a few compelling grooves on the thing here and there but I mean the vocals the synth Tambor's the the production generally it's just uh it's it's just like such a I don't know just like a piece of bread and water there's nothing all that thrilling about it or sexy or fun and those are three things that should be characteristics of most synth pop albums this new Laura Jane grace album slipped by me because I really wasn't all that huge into the more recent against me records that have been coming out but I do have to say in defense of this album it is a decent attempt at doing a singer-songwriter record but with some punk e'er harder more aggressive sounds it almost borders on power pop at some points I think some people might be a little underwhelmed and unhappy about the the lack of kind of a very overt punk sound and aesthetic that Laura's fans most likely expect from her years and against me but if you kind of look at this record from more of a singer/songwriter perspective just with some louder guitars it's it's actually not that bad sometimes the lyrics flub and they're not that great and occasionally as Laura tries on a bunch of different you know subtle genres of underground rock and singer-songwriter stuff some some instrumental palates are blander than others I don't think it's that bad of a release in fact I think the raw presentation of these cuts is a little bit more fulfilling than the cleaner and more primped sound of some of the more recent against me records so this is a 20-18 electronic project that I just ended up not really commenting on because after listening to it multiple times I just really wasn't sure what to say about it I was at a total loss and kind of torn I mean in one breath I really enjoy the deconstructed Club elements of the beats on this thing I like the really weird grooves and percussion I like that it's kind of reappropriation smooth ideas and doing some really crazy stuff with it and then on the other hand there are a lot of sounds on this record that I find utterly horrible like just the sound of some of the synths the sound of some of the drums it seems like the intention is to pick the most unlikable and gaudy sounds possible and I don't even mean like over-the-top and like a PC music sense you know like a bubblegum bass sort of thing where it's really chirpy and it's just heavily distorted and sometimes it sounds like super experimental but also super cheap as well I just sort of seem like a clash of aesthetics that I couldn't really come to appreciate no matter how weird I could sort of appreciate it to be on the surface it's it's still something that I will probably reflect on in the coming months just how odd this record was for me but I'm gonna just just really couldn't bring myself to be crazy about it this'll and Oh chill record is also one that perplexed me in 2018 there were some teaser tracks on it that had me excited as far as a very abstract and very left-field hip-hop record also mellow music group is a notoriously good label with a very consistently great discography and not to say that this album is bad and that's why I glossed over it I guess I just had a hard time wrestling with it and kind of coming to a conclusion as to what it was and what exactly it was shooting for I mean Lando is certainly a talented and a versatile artist because there are some cuts on here that are really hard-hitting grimy left-field abstract hip-hop there are other cuts that are more soulful and R&B bass there are other cuts that are just whacked and not quantized and very wonky and strange and surreal and kind of trippy like there's a lot of weird flavors of hip-hop going on here but I just felt like Lando consistently just felt lost in all of it like I was just trying to get a sense of who he was on this record and what this album was again but there's just so little consistency to it it's kind of like the weirdest most left-field abstract hiphop mixtape that jumps around so much it's almost bordering on frustrating there were some lyrical moments on this thing that didn't have me rolling my eyes like that Power Puff girl line or like the the Obama drama line there's there's a few but mostly on future projects I would just love like a stronger sense and and sort of like a greater presence of Lando's voice on these tracks so it's kind of clear who exactly is guiding the madness and and what message he's trying to convey with these cuts as some of you who watch this youtube channel may know I've never really been huge on the band big thief or anything like that however there were some songs on this new Adrian linker record that I found to be completely mesmerizing and beautiful sure maybe as a whole project it's a little brief the material on here is scant and occasionally it's a little too faint however if you are deeply mesmerized by the subtlety and the nuance of this album and you really dive into some of the guitar work and an Adrian's beautiful voice on this album which I appreciate much more in the strip back context this is an absolutely beautiful little acoustic left-field singer-songwriter record that you absolutely should not miss so do give this thing a shot if anything I've just said sort of piques your interest legendary producer blockhead is back with a new LP of instrumentals and collaborations and while I was pretty excited to listen to this thing I don't know I don't think anybody but his most hardcore fans are really going to love this one because it does truly feel like a mixtape of just like leftovers and what is landed on the cutting room floor I mean not only in terms of the variants and quality between the features on this thing I mean there are some standout ones like the Billy woods feature and the Aesop Rock feature and the Vic Spencer feature is actually pretty great as well as well as the instrumental attached to that cut however however however however there are some other tracks on here like the Armand Hammer cut which just sort of seems like a leftover from an arm and Hammer record there are other instrumentals and and feature based songs on here that don't even really feel mixed or mastered properly and they're significantly quieter or more low-five than many of the other cuts on this thing so god the the quality the volume level pretty much every characteristic that could go into a blockhead song the variations from track to track to track are huge there's just very little in terms of consistency and flow to this record would have preferred something maybe a bit punchier and tighter with a better underground all-star cast but if you don't mind something that's kind of chilled out and weird and a little cobbled together something that paints a nice relaxing abstract backdrop then I don't know give it a shot better oblivion Community Center a record that I was not anticipating talking about this year it was pretty much a surprise drop a full collaborative LP between Phoebe Bridgers and Conor Oberst of bright eyes Fame who would not want to hear these two talented songwriting voices together on one entire album I know I certainly did of the song Dylan Thomas definitely had me excited because it's like a really great piece of a folk rock with some sharp lyrics and some kind of grimy distorted guitars it's got a nice attitude to it but unfortunately the vast majority of the material on this record outside of that cut is just kind of very milquetoast folk rocky duet stuff as underwhelmed by this as I am by that recent Courtney Barnett Kurt Vile collaborative record maybe even more so I don't know it's pretty excited going into this thing but there's very little on this record that stands out frankly it's just very average and a lot of the tracks on this thing are just too too underwhelming and just very little in the way of chemistry between Phoebe and Connor it has been a very long time since we have heard from buek and gas and experimental and indie rock duo that I reviewed a while back I gave their last full length record a pretty glowing review if I remember correctly however I did not really get all that much out of this new LP frankly I appreciate the move they made toward I get some more pop centric sound something a bit punchier and groovier and sweeter on the melodic side of things but I feel like every sound going into these songs is like the most obnoxious thing that buchen gays could imagine whether it be the nasally vocals and some of the distorted and very shrill synth bits and the pummeling pieces of percussion usually I'm not so averse to things that are this noisy but god this was a very I guess I'll just say annoying listen I'm not really sure what else to say I'm not trying to be too brutal here or anything but really truly the the sounds and the Tambor's of all the instrumentation going into this thing I did not care for it at all as weird and quirky as I enjoyed buchen cases previous records to be I just don't really care for the sound palette of this thing not one bit why after all these years why I was keeping an eye on this band after what they put out last year which was kind of an interesting mix of modern metal and pop rock and rap and metalcore and I don't know I appreciate and I am familiar with many of the influences that are going into this new fever 333 record it's cool if they brought them together the sounds of metalcore along with a huge huge huge like Linkin Park influence on some of the soaring vocals coming out of the choruses some slightly revolutionary edgy political lyrics but I can't really say I'm getting all that much out of it honestly I like the energy I like that it's trying to say something but the the style of rap rock the band is bringing to the table on this record to me just seems painfully dated they're kind of crossing the streams in a way that we didn't really have the ability to back when these Styles were more popular because the audiences would have never had it but now they're here and now they're together and I can't say I find it all that thrilling even though I appreciate the members only series and this compilation is not bad for what it is for a group of collaboratives and Posse cuts diving into some modern trap and hardcore hip-hop cuts and some emo rap the way that this is being sold and presented and marketed just goes to show you that labels will put xxx tenth osteons name on anything just to get some streams off of it because while there are some decent cuts on here the inclusions of X on this record feel just as awkward and is thrown together as what we heard on skins Plus to say that he's presenting this thing I think is is really a stretch too far after a week of returning to this Mele album again and again and again it's just pretty much another generic Auto crooner record I'm not really sure what Mele brings to this style that no other artists out there don't the beats are really smooth and buttery his voice is kind of obnoxious but not so obnoxious that makes listening to it impossible the lyrics are just okay a few of the song topics are kind of weird but outside of that there's not really a whole lot of personality or anything distinct about this record it just really falls in line is incredibly average and is barely even fun to listen to and that is another installment of our y-you know review

strGSJ96ams,hi everyone Susan Easley tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new boogie record everything's for sale this is the new full-length album from Compton California rapper boogie his big breakout project for Eminem's own Shady Records which is turning some heads because this is a somewhat unlikely signing for the Shady Records label typically shady platforms artists that Eminem has some kind of personal history with or vested interest in like 50 cent and g-unit or slaughterhouse and d12 and while I'm not exactly sure how boogie and Eminem's paths crossed I'm kind of glad they did because Boogie is certainly a breath of fresh air to the shady roster his sound and style are actually pretty contemporary and I think would appeal to a pretty wide array of rap fans not just the lyrical miracle niche that many shady artists are known to inhabit honestly if I had to guess what label this record was on based on its content and its sound I most likely would have said Jay Cole's dreamville the instrumentals on this thing are consistently chill ranging from very laid-back and relaxing melodic trap to beats that have some very pretty and luxurious or even spacious jazz instrumentation like on some passages of the lol s mhm interlude or Christian Scott's excellent trumpet playing in the second leg of the album on the song whose fault there's really nothing too aggressive or over the top on the instrumental side of things on this record generally speaking it's a pretty smooth and cerebral listen outside of a couple low-key bangers nothing that really pops out or feel super in-your-face and that's pretty much also the case for boogies flows and delivery most of his rhymes are set at this very steady mid pace however Boogie is no lyrical slouch though the storytelling on these tracks is actually not that bad boogie can focus really well on a topic when he sets one and on at least a few occasions he drops a couple of flashy dense verses like on the outro to the track Soho boogies voice is also kind of nasally it has a light rasp on it when he's singing he reminds me a little of a chance the rapper there are at least a few spots on this record where I catch a few Kendrick isms however the influence isn't so overbearing that you can't listen to it or anything like that I think the similarities between boogie and these other more popular conscious artists will only help him in the long run and even though there are some popular rappers out there that he does remind me of I think he does his best to set himself with his songwriting the tone of his lyrics because generally the content of this record it's pretty forlorn it's pretty dejected depressing with boogie rapping about his thin skin his lack of confidence being at odds with his girl in a relationship or the mother of his kid being called the fuck boy being essentially emasculated seeing his friends or family caught up in poverty or violence and sadly being too stuck in his own feelings to stand up and be a debt just drowning in his own negative emotions is kind of the gist of the opening track here with boogie addressing criticisms of why are you rapping about this stuff nobody wants to hear this aren't you tired of saying all this stuff and the conclusion he essentially comes to is you know you're tired of hearing it I'm tired of living it so as you listen to this record don't miss the point of boogie style and this record in general and that's essentially to wrestle with your own emotions the worst and the most negative stuff in order to come to a point where you can overcome obstacles overcome yourself boogie in this project definitely have a lot of good things going for them you can tell that he's put in a lot of work with the mixtapes he's released up until this point to prepare for what he's doing now it shows in how well he raps it shows in how well he sequenced this project but for something that is such an easy and moody listen on the surface there are quite a few potholes as you travel through the record whether it be some of the shorter cuts on here that I think could have used a bit more size and scope either to be more satisfying as a song or just better illustrate the point that boogie is making with the track like on Soho or live 95 both of which I think reach abrupt endings or even the album's final three tracks which I all think could have used a little bit more these moments mostly feel like really good ideas but they're not built out enough to the point where they feel like anything more than just like a motif or like a little interlude and given that boogie is cut from this cloth of part wrapper part singer there are some cuts on this record where he is just straight singing and boogies voice it's very nasally it's kind of underwhelming it's not bad in small doses on the cuts where he's rapping quite a bit more but when he's just singing from front to back on a track it's really it gets kind of stale because his singing voice it's not one of his biggest selling points especially on the song skydive the much more instrumentally lush sequel to this track later on the record might be better but not by much in general I'm not against the idea of doing a low-key or a melodic or a song cut on this album these song no warning is definitely a highlight here but that's mostly because of the background singers on the track that kind of balance out boogies vocal shortcomings and finally it's the features on this record there's the black feature on here which i think is pretty bland and uninteresting and then there's the mmm feature on the track rainy days which is so bad the hilarity of it has kind of outshined what little hype this album has going for it people on the internet are sharing Eminem's lyrics from this song talking about how bad they are without having a discussion about what record these lyrics are on and whose song it is now as far as Eminem's delivery on this track goes it's actually not that bad it's one of the more slightly aggressive cuts on this record so Eminem's attitude really kind of fits into the track he doesn't sound as staccato or as too constipated as he has on his more recent work the sound of Eminem's presence on this song does not interrupt the song or derail the album or anything like that you can really kind of let it slide if you completely ignore what he's saying but goddamn the lyrics just the opening lines I left my legacy hurt fucking absurd like a shepherd having sex with his sheep fuck what you heard uh the closing cut on here is a pretty decent attempt Eddie buttery smooth R&B and rap blend but for the most part boogie sounds like a sad chance the rapper Carbon Copy especially with that nasally rasp especially with some of his inflections like that you don't even smoke anymore you don't laugh at my jokes anymore overall I think this album is pleasant while it's on the sound is pretty cool there are some standout tracks where I think boogie gets to the heart of some really significant personal issues the record starts off pretty strong instrumentally it's pretty tasteful it's pretty consistent but there are a lot of elements to it that I find kind of bland there are some lackluster features there are some tracks that I think are criminally short and underdeveloped as a whole record it blends together pretty nicely and it's not too long so it doesn't overstay its welcome either it it's not a demanding listen but unless you're dealing directly with the emotional turmoils that boogy is presenting on these tracks it's not necessarily an adventurous or a challenging listen either I think this album is ok and suffers from many of the same issues that a lot of debut records do but still shows a lot of potential I'm feeling a light to decent six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it

xi9YRCX1miE,hi everyone bill years our trash here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the brand-new Bring Me The Horizon LP um oh this is the latest full-length LP from UK rock outfit Bring Me The Horizon a group that I have covered before but in all honesty Bring Me The Horizon is a band that I've never really had that much personal investment in a band that I've never really gotten that much out of their particular brand of heavily edited and formulaic and commercially viable metalcore has never really been my cup of tea that not only goes for bringing the horizon but the countless other bands that are similar to them in style and scope and even though general consensus amongst the music nerd community might say that Bring Me The Horizon is a bad band maybe I'm kind of biased against their sound because I grew up in an area of the country that had deep metalcore roots and purist tendencies which might have made me less able to enjoy how the genre as well as post-hardcore has evolved past bands like Fugazi and converge and botch and integrity and earth crisis all the new york hardcore and beatdown hardcore bands hate breed and while part of me does miss those days maybe being entirely dismissive toward any of the new stuff isn't the right approach either something I'm slowly beginning to realize after watching many many a Finn McEntee video punk rock MBA check him out because a lot of his work has reminded me just how versatile the metalcore scene has been post my interest in it once of course you stripped away all the terrible trendy scenester and MySpace core crap and of course metalcore is not unique in its creative shortcomings over the years the indie rock that I quickly latched on to in the 2000s is in the middle of its own artistic and identity crisis as of late still though I'm not trying to say that Bring Me The Horizon is this all-around great band that I'm just now realizing I like for me sempiternal is still very much a hard pass but the group's 2010 record there's a hell actually has some pretty fantastic and cathartic moments on it and maybe I should have paid closer attention to the band's last full-length LP where they made the surprising turn toward pop rock and alt metal a record that kind of left me scratching my head because I was confused used as to why any new rock group would want to bring back the sounds they were toying with on these songs because a lot of the alternative metal and especially the new metal of the 90s and the 2000s it's really been either forgotten about or just look back upon with disdain and it's sort of understandable in a way because the ratio of good to bad records is really blop cited but the era did have its good bands and it's creative highlights and I think Bring Me The Horizon does their best to take some of the brightest spots out of it and build on those creatively here I mean the most obvious musical influence on this entire record has to be hands down Linkin Park like the first couple of Linkin Park records there are so many pummeling courses on this thing backed with roaring riffs and these soaring raspy lead vocals that sound like something straight off of the hybrid theory there are also some small nods to more obscure bands and hits during that era - like Ally Sykes on the track mantra there's a moment where the flow on his voice during the pre-chorus sounds like that of the hook on the trapped song headstrong that's true on top of it the band works and some really sweet pop hooks and unlikely bits of instrumentation that you wouldn't usually hear in this brand of metal music like the gigantic horn sections on the finish of wonderful life that are pretty tastefully executed they just sound amazing against the groovy guitar riffs and dramatic drum fills and as long as we're talking instrumentation the closing track on this thing it may not be one of my favorite cuts on the entire record but the string sections worked into that are pretty tastefully executed - and I'm also pretty surprised that the lyrics and the song topics on this record aren't nearly as vapid as one might expect them to be in this style of music to go back to the song mantra as a single it was actually pretty cool to hear these really distinct themes of belief and lies and truth and religion and cult-like behavior being worked pretty boldly into the song and the music video as well my interest also peaked on the lyrics of the song nihilist Blues which is also pretty standout thanks to its really shrill aggressive shoegazing electronic instrumental that sounds like a throwback to the first two Crystal Castles records not only that but Grimes actually appears on the song which is one of many very unlikely crossovers on this al I want to emphasize that bring me the horizon they're not just putting together a novelty metal record that brings in a bit of pop a bit of electronic music no I mean there are some features and some genre crossovers on this thing that no other group at bringing the horizons level are willing to do at this point there's also the song wonderful life featuring Dani filth of Cradle of Filth not only is this cut a good song it's a total banger with these 10 ton riffs and massive drums it all sounds like heavy machinery but I'm pretty intrigued by the lyrics that dive into these themes of drugs and mental deterioration aging and wasting away which is kind of a mature theme for such a young sounding metal band to incorporate into their record then there's also the song heavy metal which is a pretty catchy and clever commentary on the band's current shift in style diving into some of the negative reactions the fans have had to these more pop and electronic centric tracks that Bring Me The Horizon has been producing and believe it or not it's actually a really versatile and well crafted track with a lot of great phases to it from the gigantic guitar passages to these lighter more electronic bits there's literally a beatbox section on this thing provided by Rahzel of roots fame he used to be affiliated with the group honestly I haven't heard from the sky in years where bring me the horizon dug him up or why they thought to do so not really sure but I'm glad they did because it's a really cool section of the track again the crossovers on this record are insane and not super tacky and not just brought into the fold for the purpose of appealing to a wider audience like I don't know looking at you new Tom Morello record you pile a garbage you tracks like in the dark and medicine while they may not have some of the bells and whistles and weird stylistic turns that other cuts on here do they do show that the band can pull together some very infectious and heavy anthemic pieces of pop rock even if I do think the lyrics on the latter of those two cuts are kind of corny like this person being a gray cloud on your life and you're being mistreated so now you're gonna give them a taste of their own medicine get ready you might feel a pinch it's gonna be like a shot like I'm giving you a shot I'm a doctor you're gonna take the medicine even though I do have a lot of praise for this album so far there of course are some lope in the tracklist or moments that just don't really move me all that much like the kind of bland and melodramatic intro track sugar honey and iced tea easily has the most obnoxious hook on the entire record even though I do love the heavy sinister instrumentation hanging in the background the nasally falsetto vocals on the chorus just sounds so unintelligible and mushy to the point where they they just I think get lost in translation a bit the song mother tongue is totally unabashedly pop songwriting it sort of reminds me of stuff that Coldplay had been trying to do on their latest LPS but a lot less repulsive there's a bit of a loud rock edge on the chorus but honestly what what underwhelmed me about this track is that the band doesn't really put their same dark moody spin on it that they do their other four raise and two pop and electronic music on this record which is honestly one of the major things that makes these genre crossovers kind of special it's what makes these Bring Me The Horizon songs Bring Me The Horizon songs even when they play with unlikely sounds and genres example the song why you got to kick me when I'm down which may be the most prominent musical influences on this cut are trap and EDM and pop rock but it's actually a kind of refreshing marriage of sounds backed by a pretty solid tune the band also makes sure to work in a couple of pretty decent electronic interlude bits that tastefully fill out the tracklisting without feeling like filler or like they shouldn't be there I think the record has a pretty decent flow despite the handful of cuts that I don't care for quite as much the whole thing is consistently anthemic and heavy and luscious and even though I do think in a sense this band still is not truly my cup of tea I did come away from this thing very impressed by how adventurous it was how many risks the band took on this record how many of those risks panned out really well the songwriting quality and the maturity that they show on some of these cuts their ability to craft one of their most commercially appealing records yet while also dishing out these heavy exciting blends of metal and pop and electronic music I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my head is another video

ujPHUKQ4C7Q,ah hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for a review of the new deer hunter record why hasn't everything already disappeared the famed indie outfit deer hunter they are back with a new record the Atlanta band has long been celebrated for their noisy neo psychedelic and surreal approach to indie rock and pop and they have crafted some pretty excellent records over the course of their nearly two decades isten s-- cryptograms micro castle and what i see is like the crown jewel of their discography Halcyon Digest however I do think the band has been taking some puzzling turns lately and over emphasis on solo material one of their more recent releases monomania was solo fide that I think it kneecapped the enjoyability of the record meanwhile the band's last big commercial record fading frontier was so clean in its presentation it was easily Deerhunter slickest record yet overall a more commercially appealing release but lacking in the weird creative edge that makes the band's best albums their best albums so in this progression where does that put why hasn't everything already disappeared is it a bounce back is it a return to form is it a refreshing new direction honestly it's it's none of the above this thing is hands-down the band's blandest record it is chock-full of these middling instrumentals that occasionally get a little trippy a little art rocky vaguely baroque in there pretty and luscious arrangements but despite how layered this album occasionally gets the pacing of these songs can be very tedious and the presentation of this instrumentation frankly is just kind of boring very basic very dry not nearly as adventurous sonically and texturally as Deerhunter has been known to be I mean don't get me wrong the band does take a few risks on this LP there are a few unexpected cuts like Greenpoint gothic and instrumental cut with mostly lifeless rhythms and Halloween synths and these very plucky intervals that sound like they're coming off of a xylophone but most likely are not the whole thing sounds like a quartet of cartoon skeletons starting a progressive synth band and like banging out notes on their rib cages even more unusual is the incredibly abstract D torn Amal who inclusion on to the record and its message seems to be rooted in some meta commentary about art in the world and travel the entire track revolves around this somewhat disjointed instrumental and some heavily heavily manipulated spoken word it mostly just sounds like I'm listening to elevator music at a postmodern art installation the song turning is another track that's mostly instrumental it features the same plucky instrumentation that was on Greenpoint gothic but now it's being delivered in this very steady arpeggio state it's set against a very thick and droning horns as well as these cultish group vocals it's another moment on the record where the pacing is kind of tedious though even if I do think the stylistic change of pace is kind of refreshing for deer hunter I do like the deer hunters trying to change it up a little bit but these unusual detours for the band are not really great enough to be highlights on the record nor do they creatively reinforce the core tracks of the album all of which are pretty uneventful Deer Hunter which wouldn't necessarily be the worst thing in the world if the songs and the performances were super sharp and why hasn't everything disappeared does deliver some well written and well produced songs a personal highlight for me on that front is the song Plains the tight funky groove on this track is delivered with a playful demeanor the layered instrumentation is gorgeous the soaring synths or strings are heavenly however Plains does not reflect the numerous low points throughout this album that are pretty uneventful like the frustratingly awkward and indulgent closing track on this record it has this kind of rickety ragtag vibe to it but none of the entertainment value that usually comes with sounding this raw the progressions and the pacing and the instrumental interlude that the track just kind of coasts out on are all pretty drab Bradford Cox is really over selling the song vocally as he's kind of contorting his voice throughout the points of the song where you can actually hear him where his mic isn't literally dropping out obviously an intentional choice but it's not something that adds to the entertainment quality of the song in my view and believe it or not this is one of the rare moments on this record where Bradford actually sounds like he has kind of a pulse I'd say on the first two cuts of this thing he sounds so comatose it actually takes away from the quality of the song right and the tunes on this thing don't really pick up until we get to the song element who's very easygoing rock grooves are great I love the regal chords and the weepy layers of instrumentation as well as the background vocals that are very deep and in sync and very tight element alone so definitely one of the more fun and cheeky moments on this record I think futurism is another spot on this record where the band's pop prowess shows but the recording is so just one-dimensional and gray and flat and solo Phi that I think it again impedes on the enjoy ability of the track I personally just don't see what Deerhunter gets out of such a flat gray lifeless sound as I used to truly love deer hunters releases for their color and their texture and their kaleidoscopic aura and now with this record it just sounds muddy and occasionally vaguely dreamy and not that you can't do this sound justice I think there have been bands that have been working with similar aesthetics to this record and have gotten better results but somehow less recognition one group that certainly comes to mind is paper cuts but I don't know man this record to me it's a total crapshoot the vibe the style the recording quality the song quality there's really very little in the way of consistency on this LP it's truly all over the place I mean at least on some of the Bands more recent releases that have underwhelmed me it seemed like they went into the record with a cohesive idea or direction meanwhile this feels really messy really half-baked really underwhelming a few tracks and songs that I thought were pretty decent but could have been greatly improved with better production or at least weren't held back by whatever production they were filtered through on this thing a few weird abstract and instrumental additions that mostly felt like filler yeah I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the Bellas well over here next to my head is

Bf6ivvOanxI,hi everyone wheeze in the air tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the brand-new Weezer record the the teal album it's another it's another self-titled album from Weezer with a color behind them with a new album of originals on the way the Black Album set to release later this year Weezer has found time to hit the studio and deliver 10 tracks 10 new recordings of cover songs that explore a pretty wide variety of old-school scent pop and rock and R&B jams it's a pretty tight collection of tracks at 36 minutes and features the works of Michael Jackson and AHA the Eurythmics Black Sabbath TLC Electric Light Orchestra and the cover that seemed to spark it all Toto's Africa if you remember last year Weezer responded to this grassroots fan backed campaign for them to cover Toto's Africa eventually they came out with their own version of the soft rock classic and miraculously it ended up being one of their biggest hits in years so why not go back to the well to see what else you could get out of it with a full album of cover songs now I myself I did enjoy the Africa cover even though it did elicit a lot of groans and the prospect of an entire covers album seems to have elicited even more groans from Weezer fans or Weezer haters the two are really difficult to tell apart at this point look I'm aware as anybody else's that Weezer has a pretty rocky discography but we are talking about the same band that did the pork and beans video the same band that put an actor from the television series lost on the front of one of their album covers the same band whose frontman runs an Instagram page where he posts nothing but Weezer and Rivers Cuomo memes Weezer's greatest sin across their discography is not having too much fun or just being silly no it's it's putting out sucky music so if the band wants to have some fun do something for the fun of it and the music doesn't suck who cares I'd say that's a huge improvement but sadly Weezer's kind of caught in this place where they're like in a battle the band that they are and the band that they've been for a long time versus the group a lot of their fans want them to be based on their first two records what matters more than any of that is are these covers good are the performances good do Weezer effectively put their own spin on any of these tracks are their renditions of these songs creative as far as all of that goes the teal album is is the the it's bit of a mixed bag a majority of the cover songs on this record though they do follow a pretty simple formula very much the same as the band's Africa cover first hit the listener with an intro that's almost a dead ringer for the original song that Weezer is covering then ease the listener into the realization that it is not the original it is in fact a cover song by introducing a rivers voice or maybe some other musical elements that provide a little bit of variation from the original cut but make sure you're playing everything else pretty close to the blueprint so that nobody wants to turn it off immediately once they realize it's not the song that they know and love and then once listeners are invested for like a full minute or so then start bringing in some some Weezer isms a thicker heavier punchy or mix those roaring chunky guitars and this simple formula does lead to some pretty faithful and very entertaining renditions of everybody wants to rule the world of sweet dreams of men of this as well as a there is also an amazing version of TLC's no scrubs on this thing - on this cut Rivers is very self-aware that he is not exactly the voice or the protagonist for the story of this track and as a result of it I think he intentionally hams it up a little bit on this cut adds a little more swagger and sass to his singing in his delivery it's a song in the tracklist that going into it I think had the most cringe potential but actually turned out to be one of the best here I also think the band effectively puts their own spin on this cut pretty well with the building vocals and wallop guitars on the bridge I could easily see myself playing and replaying the song over and over and over I've heard some people online critique the performances on this record as mere karaoke and sure maybe they are a little close to the original in some instances and if that makes these songs qualify as karaoke let me say that rivers is essentially that guy at the karaoke club that's just bringing the house down because he's killing it especially on take on me I think rivers and the band perfectly capture the fantastical bliss of that song so I do have quite a bit of praise for a lot of songs on this record however there are other cuts on here where I think the results are less than desirable and the formula changes up usually for the worst the bands take on Black Sabbath's paranoid sees Weezer going from doing covers to literally like bad impressions of bands Brian Bell's vocals on this cut just sound like bad Ozzy vocal cosplay the thunderous blown out guitar chords and drums are very heavy but I think the band's performance on this cut lacks the the finesse that Sabbath originally brought to the table on this song I think the group's version of elo s mr. blue sky leaves a lot to be desired to the original cuts quirky and quaint mix is pretty great meanwhile Weezer goes for something that is much plainer and average and heavier I get that it's more in line with their usual sound but the very stiff and peppy tempo of the track with a I guess sort of more straightforward delivery just feels like the band is trying to rush through the song if they were gonna play it this straight I think they could have gotten a lot more soul out of it by slowing down the tempo and just doing this track a bit more passionately because the silly and playful demeanor of the original is where a lot of its appeal comes from and Weezer has completely lost that Weezer's rendition of Billie Jean I think borders on unintentionally hilarious as rivers does his best to not only sing the lead but also recreate every single Michael Jackson ad-lib in the background - which leads to a lot of weird and ridiculous vocal flubs and yelps and other contortions that I can't even describe the absolutely roaring guitars on the pre-chorus do seem like a little bit much for an instrumental that mostly feels like a note-for-note recreation it just makes those blaring Weezer chords just stick out in a really awful way however I do have to give it to the band for making a better version of this track than alien ant farm did of the song smooth criminal' certainly not as bad as a rock rendition of a Michael Jackson song could get but where the guitars truly do go overboard on this record is on the closing track the version that the band provides of Stand By Me the value in the original of this song is found in its ballad at the core of the track and the dramatic space surrounding it and from the first beat of this cut rivers and the rest of the band are already doing too much especially with the big fat heavy bass synth notes playing throughout the track then once the heavy crunchy metal distortion guitar chords pop in it's just over for me there's oh they killed it you're smothering the song and this horrendous distortion that doesn't know justice whatsoever and it's sad because I think the band actually did a decent job of covering more nuanced numbers on this thing like happy together it's pretty impressive how they were able to stick so faithfully to the tune and also just beef it up make it heavier and louder and still create that sense of euphoria when they blast into the very layered and very very overwhelming hook overall teal I think is somewhat entertaining release there were only a few tracks here that were so bad that I winced and even some of the weaker spots on this thing are at least worth a giggle but for the most part this record delivers some pretty fun performances and renditions of very enjoyable pop tracks the band pulls these songs off pretty well you know I hate to trot out the well it's good for what it is defense but you know as far as a covers album orchestrated by a pretty popular rock band it is pretty decent for what it is it's definitely not as bad as covers albums get six feet under doing death metal covers of one ac/dc song after another no thank you and there are at least a few originals based records and Weezer's discography that I actually prefer teal to quite frankly I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Ouiser teal forever

yourself some vinyl a record player some speakers whatever you need whatever your audiophile needs are we get kicked back from it supports the segment supports the channel and here we go worst tracks of the week which there weren't that many there weren't many tracks this week that sort of blew me away is being uniquely bad or difficult to stand which is why there's just only one single song in the worst tracks segment this week and of course I'm just talking in terms of like major tracks here that I felt like I I needed to talk about I needed to cover but uh the song sort of shocked me this week as being a kind of difficult to take seriously was a this new stephen malkmus song so Malkmus of of course pavement fame who has dropped many many solo records post pavement and I feel like artistically he's hit a pretty predictable stride at this point however maybe this new album of his will see him kind of throwing all of us for a loop and I hope that whatever he ends up delivering on this new full-length album is a lot better than what he has given us on this flagship track over here which is titled Victor Borge eeeh and he essentially goes very rigid dramatic synth pop on this cut with lasers and heavy bass synths and you know pulsating drumbeat the song and the music video just looks like a really unfunny tim and eric' sketch I really don't know what to make of it it's it's got some intriguing moments to it but I can't really say that I liked it in any way shape or form maybe it was unintentionally funny at some spots but and maybe a few of the visuals coming out of the music video were kind of neat especially with the the laser is kind of coming and one hit his head and one who's hitting his hand it looked kind of foreboding at that point but ya cannot say that I really cared all that much for this but hey you know maybe this will be one of those tracks maybe it'll be the the connected by love on the record that once I hear the entire record and maybe this is Stevens synth pop opus over here once I hear that song and the rest of the record maybe it'll all grow on me I don't know even though I don't really like the change of pace this song provides I will say I am much more intrigued to hear Stephen take this kind of risk than I am to hear him drop another blend of Indian folk and lo-fi and oK we've you've been doing this for a long time and it's just it's getting kind of stale at this point to here and kind of branch out in this way to me seems kind of interesting so even if the first taste here wasn't really that exciting or even that likable I will say that I am wondering where he's gonna go next with this so Color Me color me interested moving on from there the tracks that I thought were kind of meh this week but still worth shouting out this New Yo Gotti cut put a date on it featuring little baby even though I'm not really a big baby fan I'm not a big gaudy fan the production on this track is killer the Melody's coming out of it are what Wow they're sweet as honey the beat is wonderful and little babies a little more animated than usual on this cut he paints the background of the cut very nicely provides quite a bit of personality to the song one of the first features of his that actually like had me kind of paying attention to what he was doing as opposed to just tuning him out is just a really awful young thug Xerox but yeah overall not like a mind-blowing track or anything like that is a little baby and God you don't exactly go above and beyond or anything but surprisingly good surprisingly stand out for both of them moving on from there the merlocks Australian band the merlocks have a new single out titled comfort zone which is a sweet ballad pretty easygoing nice mix of folk music and rock music with a little psychedelia is just a splash of that mixed in there because it is the current day Australian scene and that's out of the flavor for a lot of the rock bands coming out of there right now Mercury Rev has a few new Bobbie Gentry covers out the more popular of the two in my opinion or my favorite of the two in my opinion is the ode to Billy Joe featuring Lucinda Williams and yeah I think their version of it is a little hammy but I I do like the slower more dramatic attempt on on this song because it is quite a sad track so um you know I do like the more dramatic attempt at trying to pull this cover off not too bad if you guys have not heard this track ode to Billy Joe look up the original it's a really good track max a verse can Scandinavian did twee gays pop punk outfit they are back with another cut titled on Kel this one I thought was pretty peppy pretty catchy still the band is not really all that stand out when it comes to this particular sound and style of music but the tunes or at least solid and they give some exuberant performances so if you are looking for something a little punky a little poppy a little washed out give it a shot moving on from there Jessica Pratt is back with a new very very stripped back and very very minimal new tune titled aeroplane and yeah I didn't really glean a whole lot from it outside of just a very pretty atmosphere and aesthetic but I guess that was enough to kind of keep me hypnotized for a bit while it was on moving on from there Jenny Lewis has a brand new ballot out titled redbull and Hennessy terrible drink combination but a pretty good tune I think the instrumentation plays it a little too safe in my opinion but Jenny's vocals are quite great on the cut it's a nice mix of indie rock with a little bit of a very subtle country rock twist to it it's got some beautiful prominent pianos on it that were quite nice and oh we've given a shout out here to bring me the horizon I'm gonna be reviewing their new record this week nihilist Blues is the name of this new cut over here if I could describe the song in any way whatsoever I would say that it sounds like Crystal Castles if you had to make their sound an aesthetic appeal to metalcore fans now whether or not it succeeds it appealing to metalcore fans is besides the point really it's more of the attempt to make to appeal to metalcore fans and I actually don't think it's it's that bad so moving on from their apparatus back with a brand new cut titled Dewan which is a kind of jammy a little Spacey very pretty I love the bass line on this track quite a bit not usually the the sound and aesthetic I usually get out of one of this projects new records but I don't know it's got me vaguely interested again that bass that bass tone really did kind of win me over honestly and let's get into the best tracks this week the tracks that really kind of wowed me the tracks that really had me going oh yeah best track of the wee Oh oh yes the the vampy weeks they are back Ezra and the gang they are here and I really liked the the Regal instrumental passages in between this really feel good old-school Rolling Stones influenced arena rock tune I did a full-length review of this on the Fantana channel where I kind of glowed over it a little bit it's it's very fun too liked it quite a bit I don't like this but moving on from there we have this brand new cut over here urine of abomination part one from an artist by the name of triumvir foul this is some of the most disgusting noise infused death metal that I've heard this year and I love some of the shrill fiery licks that are coming out on top of these really sludgy heavy gory disgusting buzzsaw guitar chords and I'm now just realizing that the picture next to me depicts this weird demon character peeing into an ocean of pee so I'm going to be blurring that out to make sure that I'm not getting any strikes or anything like that so yeah it is quite gross and disgusting and I definitely lives up to the title urine of Obama moving on from there Ryan Adams actually comes through with I think one of his better tunes in a long time f the rain loved lyrics and the word play on this song quite a bit it was very clever I do think the lyrics carry the song a little bit but the tune coming out of the vocals is quite solid backing instrumentation kind of plain acoustic rock with a singer/songwriter edge to it but you know the song is solid the lyrics are solid and I think shine quite a bit despite the somewhat bland instrumental palette and Ryan Adams is very measured and middling vocal delivery moving on from there Mac so cream comes through with one of the first singles of his that's really kind of wowed me quite honestly meet again is the name of this new cut over here one thing that's always kind of bugged me about Maxo is that a lot of the topics that he approaches in his songs just feel super general nor do I find his style to be that stand out however meet again was a really sharp and heavily narrative-based track where I think he kind of bared his soul a little bit much more than I think he has on past cuts really happy to hear him moving into a slightly more thoughtful direction not to say that the themes and the grittiness of his previous songs is melted away or anything like that I just think he's kind of compartmentalizing that into a narrative and a progression that's a little bit more interesting than just kind of again throwing like general ideas and themes out there all willy-nilly and just kind of hoping that some of it sticks so definitely I think putting a little bit more thought into the structure and the build of his music and his new song over here in my opinion and really happy to hear it moving out from there J Cole middle child new cut that I liked quite a bit the beat is a little plain in my opinion but J Cole does pretty good on the hook and I like the very thoughtful lyrics that he brings to the table that are kind of an analysis of where he fits in the grander scheme of hip hop right now whether it be sort of straddling that line between pop rap and trap and more conscious hip hop and the new school and the old school because he does seem to have sort of built himself some very unique connections then and is sitting into place artistically and in a place of relevancy that not many artists out there inhabit not many artists out there who are on the more conscious side of the fence not many artists out there who are on the more pop centric side of the fence he really is kind of living up to this middle child label maybe some people might find this track a little preachy or a little overly suggestive or almost like he's he's trying to play like father figure and and that sort of thing but I don't know I thought he had some kind of profound things to say that were quite compelling I did a full length track review of this over at the Fantana channel which we'll link you to down in the description box moving on from their injury reserve is back brand new cut jawbreaker featuring Rico nasty and proteins this is a pretty heady track from injury reserved conceptually sonically the structure of the track to the way it loops into the music video the way it's kind of oriented around this the staged fashion show and everything and the point that they're trying to make about money and spending and materialism and fashion with the song itself didn't know whether or not some of the more hardcore fans are going to take to this track because of how much I think thought and patience demands from the listeners however it seems like the fans have taken to it quite a bit and it's gotten a lot of very positive write-ups so if anything great has come out of this cut and this moved to a new album for injury reserve it's that a lot of larger publications are finally taking notice of the creativity the group has always been bringing up until this point it's only taken until now that you have actually acknowledged it so you know really happy to see other people warming up to what the group is doing and great to see them getting more ambitious and looking forward to hearing more forward-thinking material like this in the future so injury reserve hell yes moving on from their gold link comes through the track that miraculously I liked if you guys follow my reviews with any regularity you know that I haven't really cared that much for gold links previous work however on this new cut over here he does land on some very interesting left-field ish production that sees him drifting a little bit away from the hip house influence of his previous records which I don't think did him all that many favors he's still rapping with that more melodic flow but I think he's a bit steadier vocally and I think the quirkiness of the instrumental on this one does complement his unusual voice quite a bit and PB long way is a really great contrast vocally and stylistically to gold link on this track so you know while maybe this track isn't the greatest thing conceptually or one of the best things that I'll hear all year I think it's just a matter of a lot of different elements working together really well and kind of becoming greater than the sum of their parts moving out from their foals has also come through with a brand new single which I liked miraculously even though I have been majorly underwhelmed by the Vans past couple of Records this new one over here still sees the band embracing the tenants of dance music and dance Punk and that sort of thing but it's mellowed out and abstracted a bit loved the vocal melody coming out of the track as well the production is a little washed out it's a little hollow but I think it adds to the somewhat weird and raw quality of the song itself and and frankly I like that because if there's anything that's been turning me off about foals most recent material it's just how smooth and overly glitzy and commercialized it's been sounding to me this sounds like they're going back into a slightly edgier direction which believe me I welcome it moving out from there digging this new Florence and the Machine single moderation quite a bit did not think the band was going to be coming back with new material so quickly however I do like the very organic drum and piano combo on this cut there's something very in the moment and natural about this song and this performance that is not only great but adds to the beauty of the tune quite a bit doesn't feel as overblown as many Florence and the Machine songs tend to sound and it's been really great hearing the band trending in that direction over the past few releases and this is certainly I think one of the more organically bodied tracks they've released in a long long long long long time maybe ever and yeah I'll just just leave it at that better oblivion Community Center is the name of a new band new record suddenly released out of the blue featuring Phoebe Bridgers and Conor Oberst teaming up with a backing band and just kind of writin and performing and singing tunes and this tract that I've heard from it because I I need to listen to the entire album soon the track Dylan Thomas is really thrilling it is badass Phoebe and Connor just kill it together vocally they have a great energy I think that having Connor in the mix with Phoebe at least on this track anyway does bring an urgency that I feel like a lot of her music has been lacking and I feel like Phoebe brings a rejuvenated kind of youthful exuberance that I think Connor has been kind of missing in a lot of his recent material and yeah just just kind of liking what the two of them are kind of adding to each other on on this new cut over here which if I hadn't said already is titled again Dylan Thomas which now that I say it I do remember saying it and I think this is the gonna be the last one that I mentioned here no two more one more here is angel dust bang my drum now previously this was like a bit of a hardcore and a metalcore band on their previous releases with connections to turnstyle and trapped under ice but now on this new cut over here they're kind of making this fun silly pop rock music which is actually infectious in terms of just like its attitude and everything I love the guitar riffs out of it love these super catchy vocals you know frankly if there's something that I miss about rock music in the 90s it's not just the grunge stuff and rock music in the early 2000s - it's not just the grunge stuff and it's not just the heavy stuff and the abstract stuff in the underground shit but it's also like you know there used to be a lot of great bands out there that people in a way lionize today in the mean community who we're just kind of silly breezy you know just trying to write super hooky dumb pop rock stuff and and not to say that angel dust is a dumb band or anything like that or the writing stupid music but you know it's it's kind of fun to hear some rock bands actually trying to have fun with their music again and not to say that pop in rock it has totally died out as hooks and courses are still pretty big and you know there are lots of pop punk bands out there that have quite a bit of energy however to me this is this angel dust track really just kind of wipes away a lot of the the super heavy seriousness that I think over the years has almost become a requirement in rock music where it's it's not necessarily it's great to have you know a serious band out there that's addressing serious issues and getting introspective and getting emotional and everything but this this angel dust tracked it's it's nice to kind of take a bit of a bit of a break from that and here's something that's a you know a bit more lively and you know just trying to elicit some some positive vibes and feels out of you so yeah I'll just leave it at that moving on from there American football has a brand new cut out featuring Hayley Williams surprisingly enough uncomfortably numb now this is great not only because I think the song is a massive massive improvement over nearly anything off the band sort of return record their last length LP but also it's it's really great to hear them working with some better production more solid songwriting and Hayley brings a lot to the cut I gotta say like there's not really anything I don't like about this song I love the easygoing vibe the guitars are beautiful the lead vocals are great again Haley comes in and provides a good counterpoint and you know brings her own voice to the track yeah I mean all around just like a W a freakin W from American football now more hardcore fans are gonna disagree with the fact that I didn't like the last record but even I am impressed with what the band brought on this this new track hopefully the fans are as well and that has been the weekly track roundup everybody hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this video and I will catch you in the next one remember everything that I've talked about is down there in the description box along with that link to our sponsor the good people over at seat geek Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup 
BFWxkPF6n0o,whoo-ha-ha hi everyone smooth-faced yeah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the brand new collaborative record from tobacco and Aesop Rock Malibu Ken Malibu Ken a new record and a collaborative duo consisting of lyrical mastermind Aesop Rock and black moths super rainbow main brain tobacco two names I hope that you are familiar with at this point if not Aesop Rock is unquestionably one of the most creative rappers of our time his style might not click with you but his dense and esoteric verses and dizzying rhyme schemes are really something to behold even on his most subpar releases meanwhile tobacco has been on the cutting edge of electronic psychedelia since black moths super rainbow broke through in the mid 2000s since then he's been putting out a lot more solo material some of which is is pretty stand out especially up friends and Ultima to massage so essentially two of the Underground's most consistent weirdos coming together for an entire project pretty exciting even if it is just ten tracks and 31 minutes on Malibu Ken Aesop's lyricism is sharper than ever whether he's going on these hilarious diatribes about how gross and reclusive he is on corn maze and on Tuesday tracks that sort of make my skin crawl and make me want to start a GoFundMe to send a cleaning service to Aesop's place like once a month for six hours we also have the tracks suicide big gulp you can check the lyrics right here which is a rarely braggadocious moment for Aesop Ruiz talking about just like slapping planes out of the sky there's also a moment here where he's cutely building up the mythos of his collaborator tobacco on this one - almost has like a slightly MF DOOM kind of quality to it and of course there are moments on Malibu Ken where Aesop reaches outside of himself and picks on some very strange topics that nobody else would think to even start to make a song about like a like a hoarder he just sort of finds beauty and finds utility in the weirdest stuff stuff that most song writers out there are completely ignoring on acid King Aesop dives into the sensational Ricky Casso murder he drops rhymes about the dudes lifestyle the drugs he did the music that he listened to it's weird it's scuzzy it's entertaining and somehow more informative than like googling about it the song churro weirdly enough is about bald eagles living in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania specifically two that were known to have nested near the city then a webcam was set up to observe them and then one day they turned up on the webcam feasting on a cat that one of them had caught which caused quite a bit of controversy Aesop Rock spares no gory details in the lyrics and cat lovers will most likely scream in horror at this track meanwhile those with a darker sense of humor might quiet lead chuckle one plus one equals 13 is a witty track diving into superstitions with nods to 13 and glass houses and showing me a sign blowing on dice two lucky socks not matching as far as Aesop goes on this thing I don't really have that many complaints I mean a few of his hooks are kind of clunky but that's about it for the most part his lyricism his topics his personality his character it's it's all great the instrumentals in my opinion are really where this album falters just a little bit the vocoder vocals and some of the choruses tabacco brings to the table are sort of mushy and nondescript very Sami they definitely could have popped with more defined melodies or maybe less manipulation to the vocals that kind of just took away their muscle their detail for the most part the singing on his end just feels like a formless blob just a little bit more than usual which I get it's kind of his calling card to manipulate and layer his vocals so heavily but it just seems like a little too much on this record also I don't think the beats are really that varied across the entire record either I mean sure there's some kind of aggressive spots here and there there some kind of low key spots here and there but for the most part they are uniformly scuzzy and kind of trippy somewhat lo-fi a lot of buzzing synth leads and some warm chords that kind of wash over you while the beats aren't super intricate they do lay a really nice foundation and they have very freaky and colorful aesthetic that brings Aesop's verses alive the closer in my opinion is kind of underwhelming and overall the brevity of the project makes it feel a bit more like lightning in a bottle than something that's been labored over for a very long time or something that's just more conceptual but I don't think that takes away from most of Malibu Ken's and joy ability if you are looking for a hip-hop record that is tight its heady its abstract it's witty and consistent and has quite a bit of character to it then I would say unquestionably give this a shot I loved it I wish there was a little bit more to it more versatility more ambition but I still thought this record was essentially pure fun for total weirdos I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this thing transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which would I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana tobacco Aesop Rock Malibu Ken forever
