CkA1sSU9MJA,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for of the new young thug and future album super slimy this is a new collaborative album from two of Atlanta's biggest voices right now in the hip hop world future Hendricks and Jeffrey Lamar Williams aka young thug and this album just unnamed and title alone is an exciting event because it is a huge collision of new talent both future and thugger have played into rural roles in guiding and shaping and popularizing this new wave of glamorous trap music packed with auto-tune crooning but instantly in in preparation for this project my mind went right to that recently released collaborative album between future and Drake a little while ago what a time to be alive it had a few highlights on it but for the most part the album felt just a little too casual kind of just like a bunch of future songs that Drake was merely featuring on or vice-versa both of them just kind of sounded like they were phoning it in on a series of very expensive instrumentals now I did not assume that was gonna be the case given that future and thugger have a lot more in common stylistically geographically and for sure they have quite a bit of crossover audience so plenty of reasons to go all-in on this project plenty of reasons to make this project huge but unfortunately super slimy just like what a time to be alive feels really really informal too I mean there are a number of tracks on here that end really abruptly and kind of finish on a somewhat underdeveloped note like the song no cap or the song three and keep in mind I like pretty much everything these songs had been doing up until the finish which is incredibly underwhelming these tracks to me sound like they would work the best sort of spliced into a DJ set or something so that you're not experiencing and listening to the entire song but you're kind of getting that hit you're in that vibe of the song before it sort of coasts out into nothing and you're kind of introduced to another track and occasionally on this thing I'm not really all that impressed with future or thug errs vocal work not to say that it's terrible but for each artist it's kind of average and it doesn't sound like there was a whole lot of premeditation on some of these songs too or a whole lot of writing or a very lengthy or purposeful writing process sometimes it sounds like both of these guys are just hopping on a beat and riffing for the most part this project just kind of leans on the star power of the double bill hoping that's enough to make the entire thing interesting but that's just not the case especially on some of the weakest cuts here like the very moody and forgettable 200 or the painfully corny real love and the song cruise ship is one of those moments where thugger is performing way below is already very low lyrical bar and his vocal runs all over the track are pretty by the numbers for thugger too you know young thug is an artist who can be really cutting-edge can be really experimental can be doing incredible things with his vocals on a track and then there are other cuts where he plays it super predictable super safe much more commercial and which thugger you get just kind of depends on the project and unfortunately this one is just an instance of him not being that adventurous and the weirdest thing about this particular song is that there is no future on it whatsoever and yes despite the fact that this thing is a collaborative album there are a handful of completely non collaborative tracks a couple of them are actually some of the best music super slimy has to offer I like future on the song for degang which is a really heart crushing and very introspective moment for him the lyrics I would say are the most consistently mournful I've heard on a future song in a while and the Aerie lead melodies on this track kind of make me feel like I'm listening to the the sad depressing in to like mask offs yang and while we're on the topic of depressing music on this thing the song group home that finishes the entire project off is a really sobering moment on this thing - and the song killed before led by young thug is a guitar backed sort of vocal cut that sounds like it could have been on beautiful thugger girls and if in fact had been it would have been one of the best tracks Saagar delivers this expansive and weird and beautiful vocal melody that he has kind of this warble e tone on it that I've never heard sing in before at least quite to this extreme and it's very odd it's it's actually kind of gorgeous and some of the lyrics on here like when he hits you with this line about being bent like a centerfold it's just one of those rare months when young thug hits you with like this amazing simile and you know that this this beautifully sad lyricism that just kind of keeps me listening to him even though he does kind of tend to emphasize quantity over quality again these are good tracks but it's kind of bittersweet given that they're not collaborative songs and just kind of adds to this overall feel that this thing really just runs like a compilation a compilation of haphazard feature tracks where no particular artist is really dominating the song and there's not a strong hook on it and it's just kind of messy neither artist is creating something on this project that they couldn't have already made separately I mean the song drip on me sounds like a leftover from futures recent self-titled album but with like a young thug feature and even when these guys do get some good chemistry going on a track like no space or hook in between each artist they're just kind of building off of one another's flow it doesn't really last all that long or the performances and the track just feel kind of redundant because thugger and future are delivering something very similar in tone I mean the first truly well-written and memorable and hard-hitting track on the entire project has to be the song patek water with offset of migos and keep in mind this song comes after five very shaky tracks the sleek synth leads on this cutter awesome the chili bouncing chord progression is nice too futures hook dazzles offsets feature is really fantastic - it's everything a banger should be however the rest of this project is pretty scant on highlights like it's pretty underwhelming I could see you being into it if you're a hardcore fan of each artist or if you're looking for some very simple Vai beat rap music - just put on that you're not gonna think all that much about overall I would say putting these guys together on a full-length has been pretty fruitless far from a game-changer and the whole thing just kind of sounds like the musical equivalent to networking and just kind of sharing in shared audiences it's it's mostly kind of listenable but I'm indifferent toward a lot of it and I wouldn't return to this thing outside of a couple tracks I'm feeling a light two decent five on this thing train you 
OGOO1os78z8,hey everyone it's it's Anthony Fantana here it's the Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for another worst to best yes I'm going over the many studio albums of thrash metal band supreme Metallica I'm just counting core studio albums of solo original material not the Garage Band album not the S&M album not not Lulu although that would that would be the best that was a joke I was just joking there I wasn't serious so without any further ado let's just get into it California thrash metal legends Metallica far from being the first metal band or the most beloved one given the multiple controversies that they've caught themselves in over the years to the point where in a way it sort of precedes the music itself regardless Metallica is one of the most culturally significant metal acts of all time I mean they did a lot to put thrash metal and metal in general on the mainstream map the band has multiple Grammy Awards under their Bell and globally about 100 million albums sold so what better metal band to take on in a worst to best because their albums really do run the gamut from thrash metal purity to mainstream metal accessibility from some of the worst and best music metal has to offer and here's the worst album the worst one [Music] Metallica early 2000s not a high point in their career I guess it's this is this is the first album I'm talking about it's the lowest point with this record the band was essentially returning back from their biggest gap in studio albums ever yes of course they just released garage ink and the SNM album but the band was kind of coasting on the fact that they had pretty much just attained legend status so they were kind of phoning it in with a series of projects that were mostly just like you know indulgent releases for hardcore fans to buy up fan can one two and three just emptying people's pockets and building up this image of Metallica as not just a band but a brand at this point it was almost like Metallica could do no wrong and they kind of tested that theory with their worst album ever st. anger the recording sessions for this album like spanned about a year which is mind-boggling considering just how little they have to show for it like this album is easily the worst produced of any Metallica record it's consistently muddy it's over compressed from the album's opening riffs on the song frantic to the very end the whole thing sounds like an unrefined demo that would have been kind of dialed up or mixed properly down the road later James Hetfield's overdub background vocals sound almost as loud as his lead vocals and there's so much ambient noise around larsa's drums that it's it's pretty distracting which is kind of a shame because if properly produced some of these songs wouldn't have been that bad like my lifestyle determines my death style which which i think is a pretty sick line you know I do like that a lot of the performances on this record have a pretty raw and aggressive tone which for a moment in the band's career I think kind of disappeared when they were writing some of their most accessible stuff and Metallica was also still kind of messing with a lot of the groove metal and new metal sounds that had been popular for the past seven years which I wouldn't say ruin the album but certainly make a lot of these songs sound really obnoxious I mean maybe it's worse than I'm giving it credit for I mean invisible kid is easily one of the worst songs the band has ever written James Hetfield's smooth like vocal harmonies on the track do not help yes this is just the worst Metallica album the worst sounding the worst written Metallica album and in my mind there's just no debating that now while I may list Death Magnetic in 2008 here as Metallica's second worst album that's not to say that you should totally avoid it I do think there is a sea of difference and quality between this record and Saint anger the production is much better much more listenable I mean generally it's a little too dry and flat but everything sounds at least balanced it just doesn't have that extra sheen that final waxy finish to kind of bring these tracks to the next level which again is yet another shame in Metallica's discography because you're one of the biggest bands on the planet you have all the resources in the world yet on these simple fundamental characteristics you fall so terribly short it just goes to show the stranglehold the industry had on music fans in the 90s and the 2000s because labels could consistently release records that were this mediocre and still rake in huge sales now Metallica's writing style on this record is more in tune with their classic thrash style but at this point it kind of fits like an old pair of jeans that you're too fat for now also Metallica just kind of showing a general lack of ideas on this thing the day that never comes sounds like a worse version of the Unforgiven and the second track on this thing is literally the third piece in a trilogy originally stemming from that song the Unforgiven and it's definitely arguable that all nightmare long features Kirk Hammett SMO slays e guitar solo ever still the riffs and the drums on this thing are pretty tight James Hetfield's vocal performances are much more on point this just isn't really a high point for songwriting in the band's career and that's kind of it much of it is pretty redundant in the band's entire discography a lot of tracks just sound like recycled ideas or like songs they have already written already but lesser versions and the record sounding as plain as it does doesn't exactly help sell it either [Music] hardwired to self-destruct dropped last year Metallica's latest record it's long-winded it's bloated overall there's kind of a lack of refreshing ideas but honestly I think this record is the band's most successful return to their thrash roots that they've attempted to come through with in years on this record Metallica just kind of seems past the point of trying to appeal to the largest audience possible and as a result on this thing they just play to their strengths what what strengths they have left and this of course leads to some indulgences and the track listing but you know overall it's still a very enjoyable album the band makes a greater effort in the lyrics here to address more social and political topics like war and violence and the military specifically servicemen and women suffering from PTSD you know I think the record is not that bad I don't really think it's that amazing either maybe it'll become more significant with time it's just kind of one of those Metallica albums that I can kind of take or leave but certainly this is a higher artistic point than of the records I've mentioned so far the album's load and reloaded dropped in the mid 90s I'm going to talk about these records together in this one segment because I don't want to reuse this joke twice load it's a load all right even bands as big as Metallica feel the pressure to change with time and in the mid to late 90s the metal music landscape was shifting thrashes see on the metal throne was being threatened by a new generation of artists all of these groove metal bands all of these alt metal bands Pantera and Machine Head and Alice in Chains and Faith No More industrial rock and metal bands like Nine Inch Nails as well as Fear Factory and you can kind of feel that new wave of sounds seeping into Metallica's style on this one with a lot of the tracks here not really reaching the intense thrash speeds that they would usually approach in the 80s some of the vocal harmonies on here were pretty moody the the slap bass line on the song cure is a kind of a weird moment for Metallica - the guitar work on this thing is occasionally kind of brooding as well however new metal is not the only influencer sound flowing throughout this album I mean there are some obvious nods to the world of hard rock on this thing and there are a lot of tracks here that are kind of just you know the lodge artistic conclusion following a lot of the material the band had released on the black album in 1991 now at the time this record was not really well received by hardcore fans they hated Metallica's change in sound they hated that they you know cut their hair short and had this new slick sort of I don't know cleaned up style they were selling out I tell ya and I certainly sympathize I don't think this is a high point in the band's career or anything and you know overall these two albums sound like the band is writing midlife crisis metal for guys who have motorcycles and pickup trucks I mean the song mama said literally has like a country twang to it but you know I personally had these albums on CD when I was a kid I liked them at the time and I think there are a lot of tracks that hold up on these two records if you take them out of the context of metallic like Thresh but they used to man some of the ballads for sure are very awful on this thing like carpe diem baby and while it was incredibly overplayed I do think until it sleeps is one of Metallica's better radio singles and I'm sorry but King nothing still kicks ass and so does give me a few for a tried and true band attempting to transition into a totally new sound it's not that awkward it could have been a lot worse and I think a Metallica took the best tracks from load and reload and just put them onto one disc it would have been a pretty great record and honestly a lot of what is on these two albums sounds better than a lot of the material that the new metal and all metal bands were putting out at the time many of whom have been completely forgotten at this point and I think these two albums stand is the last real example of Metallica trying to challenge themselves artistically if if you don't count Lulu and justice for all the last release to drop in Metallica's fantastic run of albums in the 1980s and their last pure thrash metal album before the band would go on to explore some more accessible sounds a few years later on the black album and while this album is very good it's probably their worst record that came out in the 80s at this point it's kind of apparent that the band was running out of ideas you have some very tepid cuts on here like eye of the beholder The awkward guitars and plotting drums moving their way through the to live is to die instrumental don't sound like the band are performing a song but like completing a chore also the way that the acoustic intro kind of fades out and suddenly gives way to these like thudding riffs and guitars the sudden edit right in the middle of the track that just hard transitions into these soaring guitar solos which eventually cuts to some moody finger-picking like the post-production choices on on this album are pretty questionable and and have not really aged that well and I'm sorry but I cannot help but kind of giggle still at the Viking chance on the frayed ends of sanity oh yeah this is easily Metallica's worst produced album of the 80s as well the distortion is really brittle it seems like there's like a lot of sound bleed with the guitars and the drums the album overall is just really flat it's really claustrophobic it's really dry and it's also like I've been transported to an alternate reality where bass doesn't exist like trying to find Jason Newsted space on this album is like trying to find who shot Biggie and pock now there were some unfortunate circumstances that may have sort of influenced the downturn that was this album Cliff Burton the band's former bassist had passed away while on tour as the band was promoting and performing tracks from their 1986 album Master of Puppets which could have led to the bass not being as prominent or as interesting which could have led to just the the overall lack of ideas or just what seems like the difficulty of writing a new crop of interesting songs with great performances while this record is far from what a Metallica zwarst projects it does sound like the band is kind of just Restless in their own sound which does occasion to some high points some good ballads the very epic title track I just kind of take this album as a growing pain or a transitional moment that would eventually bring them to their widest selling album of all time Metallica's debut 1983 album killem all the band's sound on this record it was not fully formed yet they really wore their influences on their sleeves I mean so many tracks on here just bleed heavy metal they just bleed Motorhead they kind of bleed punk music too but still this is a very good album in the band's discography it's a great debut album it has the gutsy fiery energy and performances that you want a new young band to have they sound like a band with everything to gain nothing to lose and even though again it's not their best songwriting it's not their best production it's not the most original sound that they've ever come up with the energy is there the passion is there and that's what makes the record exciting I mean Master of Puppets and ride the lightning that would come later after this would be much catchy er by comparison but there's still plenty of highlights here you have the throttling whiplash the epic and multifaceted four horsemen the incredibly groovy no remorse and that killer hook on jump in the fire yeah the pulling teeth instrumental is mostly handled by Cliff Burton's amazing bass playing his screaming distorted arpeggios and riffs and solos are like amazing it's he was just an incredible talent that unfortunately died in the way that he did died when he did it just would have been interesting to sort of see where Metallica could have gone or where they would have been had he been alive to see the band's entire career this is a very young Metallica this is a Metallica still trying to find itself but some of their best musical moments still land on this record and this is easily one of their most solid track lists - which makes it a pretty easy pick for like their top four albums for Metallica's third best album I'm going black album 16 million copies of this thing sold in the US alone and that's for good reason this record is most likely the most popular metal crossover of all time really because the album's appeal comes down to songwriting more than it does volume or aggression which are great it's part of what makes some of their early work so amazing but it's great to hear the Metallica has matured in their songwriting a little bit on this record it's great to hear that the band had more to offer than just thrash metal to its fans the track listing on this thing is excellent and versatile the band drops one fantastic ballot after another wherever I may roam the Unforgiven nothing else matters and even though this album is self-titled the fact that a lot of people call it the Black Album is very fitting because these songs even the harder and heavier ones show a darker side of Metallica take the song the struggle within for example which I mean is all about just kind of introspectively suffering over anger and resentment as well as depression and then the God that failed which is a song about James Hetfield's mother she had died of cancer because she refused medical treatment based on her religious beliefs and decided to pray instead and it's just really intense to think that that situation is fueling like be incredibly like bleak and despondent emotions on this track this track and many other tracks on here given the lyrics and the topics are absolutely soul shredding and because it's Metallica because we don't typically think of Metallica as a dark band or a band that addresses super dark topics I don't think this album gets you know credit for approaching these topics in the way that it does and while some of the thrash ear tracks on this record aren't quite as intense or as fast as some of the band's most celebrated material the riffs are still insanely catchy even if they are sort of measured of wolf and man through the river of course Enter Sandman arguably the band's biggest single and the song don't tread on me is just kind of like grand large-scale badassery since their album and justice for all Metallica hasn't written an album that wasn't like at least an hour and I would say the Black Album easily stands as their best solid hour of music while it's not quite as invigorating as their ATS material it's easily one of their best records and one of the most important metal albums of all time and the production is pretty excellent to the instrumentation is balanced it's beautiful Lars is drumming is dramatic it's primal the bass is incredibly audible James singing on this thing is expressive its gruff its soulful this is a mature well-crafted album and in a way it's Metallica hitting an artistic peak this record is one of those instances where you do want to really believe the hype because it's it's a big album it's a popular album for a reason Metallica 1984 ride the lightning sophomore album this record was a huge improvement on the band's debut kill them all the band was showing themselves to be way more versatile and dynamic than they had been in the past from the sparkling acoustic intro on the song fight fire with fire to the throttling heavy intense and pummeling riffs and drums that run throughout pretty much every track here I mean this album really does live up to its electrifying title from beginning to end also James Hetfield's like devilish growls on this thing the crunchy chugging guitar tone and a lot of the tracks here are more than just kind of straightforward thrash and bash aggressive metal songs like there are a lot of well-crafted and epic intros outros and and segues on a lot of these cuts the soaring guitar leads on the title track I mean friggin For Whom the Bell Tolls that intro is fantastic the ominous arpeggios on the call of cthulhu and the song fade to black is easily the band's first amazing ballad and also the song escape for his heart in as aggressive as it is like it's really an 10 ik the production on this thing for the 1980s is incredible it's vivid it's loud it's full its powerful and the experience of this music is so incredibly physical this thing is also no BS and no frills at 47 minutes long like it's one of the Bands most tight and perfect track lists truly a defining album for thrash metal and Metallica and this album is also kind of a show of just how smart and intricate thrash metal can be as a lot of the riffs on this thing are kind of creative there's some weird little harmonious embellishments here and there that kind of make them more interesting than you know your average like power chord style riffs I don't have a lot to say about this album beyond that I just think it's a great record I mean it's it's so great it just kind of sells itself and finally in my opinion Metallica's best album hands down has to be master of puppets' now I don't have a lot to say about this album and not that I don't care about this album that much or not that I don't think there isn't a lot to say but a lot of what I said about ride the lightning kind of applies to this record as well but you have these subtle improvements on just about everything that kind of just inches this record past its predecessor the performances were certainly more intense the songs were catchy er it seems like there was a more sort of cohesive lyrical theme to the entire record talking about war and violence military service people like on disposable heroes mental health on sanitarium it's just kind of a perfect thrash metal album every riff every drum fill every vocal performance amazing instrumental passages on tracks like Orion and leper Messiah and again another thing that made its predecessor amazing the tracklist is just so tight there's not a whole lot of room for BS here the band doesn't overdo it production is amazing I mean some of my favorite songs on here but it's just like pure adrenaline but there's an emotional depth to it at times as well that's very satisfying it's it's far from just being a one-note thrash album you know you do have that blood pumping aggression you have that little side of emotion you do have thoughtful themes coming through on the lyrics there's just a lot to it there's a lot of layers to this record there's very little in the way of any missteps or what I would consider to be mistakes or bad writing choices bad production choices and I just think this is Metallica at their highest purest thrash metal point and that's gonna be it that is my Metallica worst to best let me know what you guys thought hit me down in the comments and tell me what are your worst to best Metallica albums list them out yourself and I will see you guys in the next worst to best which I'm gonna be working on soon hopefully it doesn't come out a long time from now because because the these are time consuming transition have you have you given all of these albums to listen over here next to my head is a metallic review that you should check out or you can click on the link to subscribe to the channel I love you guys thanks for watching again appreciate you guys following me and everything and I don't

tYtq_39Vek0,[Music] hey everyone anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and I'm gonna lay down a quick hot raw track review here of the new Joji single will he jouji aka pink guy aka filthy Frank a K George Miller a bit of an artist of multiple mediums of visual and auditory you guys may know him from his social media and YouTube antics over the years but as his career on the Internet has drawn on George has found himself releasing more in more music whether that be under his pink eye Elias or now under his Joji alias which he's dropped tracks Lucy's here and there over the years under but now he has a forthcoming EP dropping and from what I understand another EP sort of following that up in February so sort of like sister EPS here of new music now this new track over here I guess is a you know a taster of this EP that can be pre-ordered now and it's it's an okay track it hasn't really risen my excitement that much higher than a lot of cuts that I've heard under the Joji name so far they're elements about it that I like I like the dreary very low-key sad rainy day piano sample that runs throughout much of the track the kind of slow mode pressing beat that kind of backs all of it I like the lyrical element of the track to basically longing for and missing or basically being um sort of interested in the well-being of this person who you used to be intertwined with romantically I'm imagining this person is now with another guy and joji essentially runs through the track asking you know will he play you music like I did will he treat you like shit like I did basically admitting to false as to why this person is no longer with him anymore it's a pretty sad introspective cut and it seems that as George has gone crazier with his pink guy persona and the music on that side of the aisle is sort of gotten more and more just totally whacked his Joji persona is sort of served as maybe more of like an emotional refuge we're not only he can create music that's a little bit more serious in tone but actually get legitimately sad and I don't know depressing emotions out there creatively kind of exercising these depressing demons that he may be dealing with personally now the things that kind of end up hurting the track in my opinion are structurally it's very underwhelming there's not a lot of peaks and valleys a lot of song kind of seems like it's just sort of chasing its own tail a lot of the time to the point where when the track finally ends and it's not that long of a cut I'm just kind of sitting here like that's that's that's it that's all that's going on so I think the hooks and the refrains on this thing could have been a bit stronger there could have been a bit more change up on the instrumental here just to break things up and make it seem like the song has a little bit more to offer and then beyond that I think another thing that I just continue to be a little cold on with Joe Gees music is just the singing which i think is a little better here than I've heard in the past but still George's singing is is just not that passionate it's not that captivating which may be part of him playing into the whole depressing and very downtrodden vibe of this music but there's something about his singing the seems very very flat it's very very even it's it's not exactly biting or it's not exactly connecting with me in an emotional way it's a bit of a cold fish I guess I would say so again to recap lyrically instrumentally I think there are a lot of good things that this song has to offer but when it comes to the build of the track and it comes to the vocal performance here I'm very underwhelmed about is underwhelmed as I've been with past material and I'm just hoping that as he continues to drop more and more music under this name he gets more ambitious with song structure he gets more ambitious with his vocal performances because you know certainly there is potential there it's just not fully being capitalized on I don't think so those are essentially my thoughts on this new single over here new EP on the way as I said at a sister EP to come next year at some point let me know down in the comments what you thought of this track and if you're excited or looking forward to this forthcoming project and I will see you guys in the net one transition have you given this song listen buhbuh buhbuh buhbuh buhbuh buhbuh buhbuh over here next to my head is a review of the last pink guy album and I'll see you guys in the next video you're the best forever 
UFvtS9JDllU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and I'm doing a quickie review here of an up-and-coming New York rapper who goes by the name of Lou the human this dude I hyped him up a little while back on my best worst track segment a couple of times talking about some of the new tracks and music videos he had been releasing were really good and I like this guy's very dark tortured rap style it's not like horror core or anything like that that was certainly like kind of flirting with that idea the dude has a new project out it's titled humane e ACK it's got ten tracks on it's pretty tight no BS project and he really does kind of where his influences on his sleeve he does sound like a young artist who's still trying to come into his own sound he seems hugely inspired by the the lyrics and the flows and the musical styles of guys like Eminem or Earl Sweatshirt especially some tracks on here he almost seems like a dead ringer for Earl Quasimodo as well I would also you know extend the comparison to Tyler the Creator as long as we're sort of making odd future named drops here and although I will say you know more than a lot of Tyler's early work you know Lew does have an incredible amount of proficiency when it comes to lyricism and flow like he is a little bit of a rappers rapper I would say obviously not the most technical guy you're ever gonna hear but he certainly you know is a bit of a breath of fresh air in this age of mumble rap especially considering that you know he is lyrical but he's also kind of grimy and aggressive too you know it's not like completely heady hip-hop music you know there's something kind of weird and warped and sad and depressing about it too which is kind of part of the emotional course for a lot of newer hip-hop out there today that takes a bit of a moody tone I will say there are some things holding this project back though like lose influences being so blatantly apparent that it can be distracting occasionally I think there could have been a bit more emotional variety in the track listing some tracks that went a little harder or tracks though that we're a little bit catchy or just to bring a you know just break these tracks up a little bit more because it does seem all a little OneNote as far as tone and as far as um just the mood of the entire project also while I do like the concept of voices in his head and sort of this schizophrenic angle that he's kind of playing at with some of these tracks there are occasions on here where he plays up to it's so heavily that the voices get distracting I think they sort of you know become a bit of a gimmick and take away from the raw talent that should really be the selling point of the entire project you know it just kind of seems like he has a little ways to go but there's tons of potential here there are a lot of good tracks on here there are some hilariously smart and wickedly dark instances of wordplay on this thing that I think are you know some of the best I've heard this year it's just that you know it sounds like a starter project it sounds like a starter tape or a starter album but you know it seems like lieu because of his talent is starting at a higher grade than a lot of artists do you know he didn't need a team of super producers to come in and make this thing sound great if there were some other producers out there or you know who he could work with that are maybe a bit higher level or something or you know put more time into a sound craft or just develop his sound a bit more because some of the tracks on here seemed a little old like maybe from 2016 or something you know I would love to sort of hear where he would go from here because I am routinely impressed by some of the newest songs on this project I'm gonna leave it at that screw score on this thing I'm telling you guys to check this kid out he has lots of potential I think that if he keeps dropping music and he keeps growing and he keeps progressing he does have a future and I'm kind of excited excited to see that future unfold I'm gonna leave it at that looking forward to hearing more music from this dude I generally enjoyed this tape it's just far from a perfect project you know and he's far from a fully developed artist but you know it's definitely seems like he's going in that direction you know he's certainly pointed that direction and that's what I like to see that's what I like to hear let me know what you guys think down in the description box if you give this thing a listen did you love did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next over here next to my head is another review that you should check out or click on the link to subscribe to the channel I'll see you in the next one forever

right these tracks all the tracks and the things I just shouted out all down there in the description box cool cool all right worst tracks of the week what were the tracks that hit me as being works this Jesus Christ oh Jesus okay well I mean of course I had to throw the new Weezer track in here the new Weezer song being happy hour it's it's it's not a happy hour it's a very sad hour while maybe at its core this is your typical Weezer song with a Rivers Cuomo is very playful flirty silly boyish young innocent lyricism and and songwriting but the production on this thing it's so vapid and it's so beachy it's just a huge turnoff and I don't care for it at all you don't really know what to say about it beyond that while I don't begrudge Weezer the ability to experiment and try out some new sounds I would love for them to maybe try to venture into the unknown as opposed to just trying to I don't know write the next best coast album I'm moving on from there of course I don't really care for the new Taylor Swift single gorgeous I don't know it's to me this single isn't quite as awful as the tracks that have been recently released but what sort of sticks out about this one is that there's really absolutely nothing special about it whatsoever it's just super formulaic and forgettable that's kind of what makes this one awful the previous two had some very bad qualities to them but this track over here it's just formulaic to the core and there's just really absolutely nothing special about it and that's just kind of what makes it lackluster but let's get into the tracks that I thought were man songs that were certainly worth shouting out but I wasn't crazy about him but I definitely want to point your attention toward these cuts show me the body the punk fault noise rap funk metal like there's so many genres running throughout this bands style they have a new single out the single being titled k9 and it's it's kind of your standard meat-and-potatoes Punk track you know it's it's certainly better than a lot of the very abrasive and lo-fi and mostly unlistenable material from their recent mixtape but it's certainly not as special as like their self-titled project at least what I'm hearing here but you know show me the body has the tendency to sort of jump around stylistically on a project so you know this song may measure up when I hear a shoulder to shoulder with a bunch of other tracks that may be a bit more unique in tone or in sound moving out from their Lindstrom has a new track out with Jenny hvala who actually III would say gained from each other quite a bit on this collaborative track like Jenny's vocals are very artsy and abstract and strange and kind of eye widening meanwhile Lindstrom's dancey driving electronic production provides like a really great foundation for her to do her spoken word performance on the instrumental you know on the track rather so uh you know it's it's not fireworks or anything but it's it's certainly certainly an interesting collaboration certainly an interesting crossover next I've been meaning to talk about this track for weeks and I kept forgetting and people keep yelling at me every single time I forget what the new Frank saw Ocean song will relatively new Frank ocean's song provider yeah you know unfortunately I just thought the song was ok while I do appreciate these somewhat minimal and low-key production here that I enjoyed so much on blonde to me this track like many other post blonde Lucy's that Frank has been dropping its it just doesn't really have a strong song you know it's just kind of all over the place I wouldn't say it's Direction lists but it certainly doesn't seem to have much in the way of focus as far as songwriting goes I'm not not that strong of a single in my opinion you know there's certainly an emotion to Frank's voice and a moodiness to the instrumentation but there's not a whole lot of follow-through I would say with this song definitely in my opinion does not measure up to much of what was on blonde and again now that Frank Ocean is sort of opened up the floodgates here it seems like we're just kind of getting this endless string of music it's just not stopped and I'm just kind of waiting for him to just settle down and just like focus on where his next album is gonna go as opposed just like just dropping all these random tracks but you know maybe this is just kind of his alternative way of kind of dropping these songs that might have otherwise landed on a b-sides compilation or something either way it's keeping a you know his name in people's mouths which ultimately is not a bad thing for him so moving on next track fever Ray has a new song out it's been almost like 10 years like you know eight years and change seven years and change since her 2009 self-titled album which was my album of the year that year in 2009 you know of course I loved Karen's music I loved the knife's music so I was kind of excited to hear that there was new Fever Ray out here and there are elements of this track that do tickle my fancy I do like the strange electronic production though it is very kind of upbeat and bubbly and strange Karen's vocals of course are as unique and as intriguing as they typically are although they have a somewhat much more cartoony and odd vibe to them that I've heard you know in then I've heard in the past when compared with other Fever Ray material or even most knife material honestly um I didn't go into this track expecting fever ray to just go for the same moody dark foreboding style that she has in the past because again it's it's been like almost it's a decade here you know who who is gonna expect Karen to do the same exact thing all over again however I did not expect her to to go so whacked out with this new single over here and the music video as well I will say though I will not go into much detail as to what happens in the music video though I do promise you if you do check out the music video for this track you will you will have a laugh you will have a laugh and maybe you don't don't eat while watching it I'll say that don't eat don't be eating or drinking liquids either don't drink any liquids but there are some elements of this track that I just find to be absolutely ridiculous you know and not really an oh that's so absurd that's so cool kind of way it just seems like silly to the point where I'm just like huh you know however maybe the kookiness of the song will grow on me as I listen to it more and more but as of right now I'm kind of on the fence with it to be completely honest this band apparently from northern Europe who's been blowing up on YouTube they have almost like a half a million views on this new single of theirs this track is titled every time and the way then though it says roy pablo of the band's name I believe is boy Pablo and it's it's it's a sweet track it's a sweet single it's just kind of it's just kind of got a sweet little Mack DeMarco type sound to it you know it's not anything original or anything like that but the music video is like very low-budget and very hilarious and it is an endearing tune you know if you don't mind the fact that it sounds just like Mack DeMarco shoutout to my dude Big KRIT who has a new single out forthcoming album which I have said on Twitter if if this album is a 10 out of 10 I will give up atheism I will give up atheism if this album is a 10 out of 10 however this new single over here wasn't insane for its title to keep the devil off it's not your typical rap track from crit which is a good thing in theory you know I've been wanting to hear him experiment a little bit more and sort of just dip out of those southern hip-hop cliches that he's kind of cornered himself in over the course of a very prolific career thus far but this new track over here is kind of like a weird bit of gospel rap that I don't know I'm not too crazy about it you know lyrically instrumentally it's it's a little lightweight most of the song feels dominated by the sample gut these sampled gospel vocals crit doesn't really seem to be the focal point of the track in my opinion or at least not lyrically or vocally is he doing much to steal the show away from the instrumental and away from the gospel vocals he's he mostly feels swallowed in those vocals a lot of the time in my opinion or just um you know uh outshined by them in a way yeah I'm not that insane about it to be completely honest but it's it's certainly not an awful track and and could grow on me once I hear the entire record and I've got to give a shout out to bad bad not good who have a new track out with Sam herring from a future islands fame and you know it's it's an all-around good track you know it's it's maybe not my favorite from them in a while not to say I would enjoy it much more than much of the songs off of their recently released album but you know it is a soulful passionate track and always good to hear from the boys the jazzy boys from Canada alright let's get into the tracks I thought were the best tracks of the week surprisingly enough yes yes this this is here i the new valve Peck track is pretty fun yes it's it sounds a little bit like I don't know the theme song to a 70s sitcom or something but you know it's a jazzy funky and ritzy and fun track and you know I went back and I listened to that new single what they had as well with that guest vocalist and then that song was very good so who knows you know this new song mr. finish line though I may have in the past maligned wolf Peck as plain boring white boy funk who's who's to say this new album could totally could totally win me over given that these two new tracks are pretty nice produced very well the grooves are top-notch you know the playing isn't exactly fiery or anything like that but it is very sweet on the ears it is very pleasant and the musicianship is quite good so shout out to volt Peck shout out to them next shout out to Sophie who is is kind of coming out in a lot of ways on this new single over here also I wanted to mention because I forgot to forgot to say that the the new vulpecula the title is down there and everything but let's let's talk about this new Sophie song I don't I don't want to distract from this Sophie is coming out in a lot of ways on this new track over here we have Sophie on camera singing dancing Sophie is also coming out as wanting to be addressed by female pronouns now you know sort of as an artist as a person you I'm imagining this is you know for personal reasons though Sophie and a lot of PC music up until this point have had elements of like the with the word I'm looking for is you know I with PC music it seems like there's always an element of things being kind of secretive like you know are these people who were seeing representing the music actually representing the music or they kind of like a veil or a mask or something um however I don't believe that to be the case with with this new announcement over here this track is titled it's okay to cry and um it is just a beautiful triumphant like quivering strange piece of anthemic pop music I really I don't know what to say I was kind of taken aback by how strange and intense and I don't know potently emotional the the whole track was yes I I guess I'll leave it as intense and just the the facial structure of Sophie on the track was just the cheek bones on the music video was just like I don't know there's just so many things about this music video in this track that just like hit me is like whoa what what I liked it a lot I really enjoyed it but part of me feels like I'm still processing all of it because it was just it was just so intensely strange intensely I don't know alluring like there's just so many things about it that the the track was really just like a rush just hit me like a rush and I'll leave it at that I guess I'm excited to hear what sophie is gonna do from here seems like a total reinvention you know not only as a person but as an artist too because this is you know far away from you know what we know of tracks like lemonade and that sort of thing you know this is not that at all this is like a whole new direction and I'm looking forward to seeing where it's going let's move on from there I don't know oh wait yeah that's coming up okay alright next I want to shout out the new screaming female song this new song over here is from their forthcoming record the track is titled glass house the two songs they've released so far it had a lot of layers to them and have been pretty dramatic and have been far from the usual basic very raw and to the point sound that the screaming females have brought on many of their records up until this point like this is some of their most refined music as far as like instrumental composition so far and I'm just liking where they're going with it you know there's keeping the guts in their music but you know the writing in the musicianship is becoming a more interesting though not to say it hasn't been interesting before you know the guitar playing has always been killer the drums have always been very good you know and the singing has always been like super over-the-top and fantastic but it seems almost like here screaming females are not given up and you know they could begin their second wind here which would be fantastic shout out to MGMT's new single little dark age I love this track like this is the best song I think MGMT we have released in a while like it's a strange like kind of gothy synth pop track that's that's just really odd and really kind of spooky I like it a lot and I hope they continue to go in this direction I hope this track is not a fluke I would love to hear them explore these sounds more because again some of the best stuff I've heard from these guys in a long time and still kind of keeping with their psyche pop roots too so pretty exciting like this track a lot also like the new king gizzard track quite a bit um you know though I'm not hedging my bets here given the two previous albums of the five records they are supposed to be releasing this year but still they could pull through on this one the track is titled crumbling castle and it's this long like ten minute monster it's multifaceted it's mystical it's you know really difficult to follow at times but still very satisfying and fulfilling in a really intriguing track it's epic as hell and easily some of the best stuff they've released this year and easily some of the most ambitious stuff they've released this year so I don't know man just sort of looking forward to seeing how this next record plays out if we're gonna get a bunch of like long progressive psych monsters on this next record of theirs and finally got to give a shout out to the new a perfect circle track this song over here the doomed is kind of like the band returning to their old form you know back during you know their heyday during like you know their debut record their sophomore record kind of like those progressive and strange alternative metal sounds are kind of coming back and the lyrics I thought were pretty cool you know had like a bit of a political and a religious angle to him just like the groove like the riffs yeah I mean I don't have a ton to say about the track outside of just that I really enjoyed it and it reminded me of their older stuff but not necessarily in a bad way not in a way where it just kind of felt like um you know they were just like treading water or something it was just kind of like oh wow they have returned and I'm kind of hoping uh you know for that to be the case when I listen to the entire forthcoming record to although I would really like a tool album I would really like to allow them I'll say that all right guys that has been the weekly track roundup all of those songs are linked down there in the description thank you for watching along with again our amazon associates

1bkP7n6RhSk,hi everyone here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new primitive man album caustic this is the second full-length album from Denver Colorado doom metal trio primitive man this thing is out now on relapse records and I first heard of these guys when they released a debut album scorned back in 2013 it was easily one of the heaviest ugliest most nihilistic doom records I'd heard that year it was very abrasive I also caught the band live at a bar by the train tracks they were even heavier and nastier in person they just had this head spliting sound but as as powerful as it was it was all still kind of OneNote I thought that scorn as an album experience was a bit of a slog and that the EP they followed that up with was was just kind of okay now as far as expectations go leading into this album I liked some of the promotional tracks but I guess I was hoping that primitive man would find a way to maybe change their sound up a little bit become more versatile or maybe pair the record down to its best most essential moments maybe think about writing songs that are a little more memorable and in a conventional sense however a primitive man didn't do that on this new album over here and and it doesn't matter it's really good instead primitive man do the exact opposite they come through the record that is longer it's like 77 minutes it's louder it's heavier it's noisier they're going more abrasive than they ever have before and the experience is pure punishment it's musical masochism straight up no daylight chained to a cold concrete blood-stained floor and each song is a different blunt object you're being beaten to death with like a police baton or a crowbar or a pipe wrench this album is surely destructive on a physical level with its massive weight it's crushing Distortion but it's also kind of destructive on a mental level to the guitar tone on this thing is abusive the vocals are hellish it feels like I'm just being sucked into a deep dark abyss from which there is no escape there are no sort of recognizable markers to tell me where I'm going or if I've been there already the sensation of this record just relentlessly wears me down and puts me in a mood where I just want to watch the world burn to ash for sure this album is less memorable than its predecessor but only in a musical sense the slow pacing of a lot of the riffs here the constant dissonance how consistently loud and sour the guitar chords are it makes it difficult sometimes to decipher where exactly things are going because outside of this usually slow pace of the record you have the occasional mid-paced sludge metal riff for maybe a riff or some chords strumming that reaches a top speed of 25 miles an hour with a hulking blast beef firing away behind it that's not to say that the album is one-dimensional not completely and that's not to say that the album isn't memorable it is it's just that the impression that it leaves is more of a sonic impression it's more of an emotional impression I just find the aesthetic of this record so stimulating it keeps me on the edge of my seat even if it's going slow even if it's kind of you know consistently loud and abrasive like the the burning distortion on this thing is searing it's like a dead flesh hitting a red-hot grill at a BBQ hosted by Satan the drums are huge dramatic mostly simple but very muscular playing and the bass on this thing also has this really deep grimy distortion to it that reinforces a lot of what the guitars are doing the vocals guttural growls kind of mid-level shrieks it's really animalistic it's like the band is literally using the sounds of doom metal to summon a demon or something the experience overall I think is pretty exhilarating it's it's really like a cleanse whatever's inside of you this album will beat it out of you it'll wring it out of you and then afterwards it'll throw you in a wood chipper just because in that sense they really do go above and beyond when they really could have just hit you with a shorter record with some you know blasting guitars and some fast drums and just kind of called it a day no instead primitive man really wanted to make sure that fans walked away from this album with no faith in humanity left and honestly when I listen to this thing I find myself enjoying it and viewing it from the angle of like more of a drone album more of a noise album or like a sun record just kind of letting the huge monstrous sound of this album wash over me and letting it's impossibly dark and nihilistic mood crush my soul also given some of the weird abstract noise interludes here as well as the very strange eerie and Spacey closer my guess as to you know listening to it more like a noise record or a drone record kind of makes more sense compositionally the the album is deceptively simple because if you actually look at what's going on as far as sound play with the subtle introduction of extra guitars and more distortion and more layering as a lot of these tracks progress there is actually more to these songs than may meet the ear unlike an initial listen because while the band isn't really doing anything that flashy in terms of writing though there are some interesting chord phrases on this thing they do successfully create an album that feels like I'm just being swallowed by sound I loved it honestly I don't want to spoil too many specifics of it and just kind of give you guys a hint as to what mentality you should have going into this record again I will say just like their last album this record is a little OneNote it is a little one-dimensional even if I do kind of enjoy the constant and enveloping harshness and drone enos of the entire album and that's not to say that I think the band needs to start writing you know catch your licks on the guitar or anything like that though maybe a stronger melodic element would bring a grandness to their apocalyptic sound the point I'm trying to make here is that if being is extreme and as abrasive as possible isn't the name of the game then I would love to see primitive man take it even further I think this album is going to be a good listen for anybody who enjoys a little pain with their pleasure and in a funny way I feel like this album sort of sums up a majority of my emotions for the year of 2017 except for the music though that me the music has actually been very good for the most part I'm feeling late to decent 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like Li subscribe and please don't cry don't cry and get angry in the comments leave an intelligent thoughtful lengthy comment for other people to read and ponder and Stroke their chins at ok over here next to my head is some other do metal review you should check out also a link to subscribe to the channel and I'll catch you guys in the next one you have any Fantana primitive man caustic forever

sxssAArYRGA,ah ah hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is gonna do a quick review just lay down some quick thoughts on this new gucci mane album mr. davis the latest project from atlanta rap legend mist mr. Gucci man listen this project it's very long it's an hour long and while it is being marketed as an album it's just kind of like a glorified mixtape at the end of the day it's got some somewhat big features from ty dolla sign and Big Sean and Nicki Minaj is on here too but here's the thing while Gucci Mane has certainly cleaned up his act and he's kind of in the middle of a new chapter of his career where things are looking a little bit brighter and a little bit more successful for him and he has dropped some some serious w's since he's gotten out of prison I mean probably my favorite of all of them has to be drop-top WAP though um everybody looking is pretty good too I mean I wasn't crazy about it but you know I thought that was pretty good but again drop-top WAP that project he has out with Metro boomin doing a so many of the the beats on that thing is is just excellent from start to finish I mean the shame about that project is just that it's not very long however this is very long and even though gucci has a newfound clarity to his delivery and to his music there are a lot of very plain and obnoxious spots on this tape like some of some of the love songs on this thing are pretty much intolerable for me i mean he does have his spots here where he delivers a great flow that's kind of quirky and unique though simplistic or has you know kind of a quirky instrumental or delivers some somewhat personal lyrics like on the song work-in-progress i wish we saw more of that side of gucci mane on this project because honestly a lot of the time he just sort of falls into a lot of the same cliches and a lot of the same very familiar tropes that you will hear on nearly every gucci mane mixtape and again because this is a glorified mixtape there is a lot of filler on here there are a lot of tracks on here that are completely unnecessary and gucci mane while he certainly does have a voice and he has style and he is a talent he's not so versatile a rapper that he holds up for an entire hour like he doesn't have that many tools in the tool belt for an entire hour of music to sound interesting from beginning to end and it's not like the features on this thing as good as some of them are Big Sean's was certainly better than I would have anticipated to be his delivery was kind of low-key but I thought his lyrics were actually kind of smart and and witty but um you know again having said that it's not like the features on this thing are exactly saving the tape or sort of making it worth trudging through the entire thing so at the end of the day I'm kind of indifferent toward it you know while it does have some highlights it's a little too clean it's a little too commercial it's a little too pristine it's a little too long it's a little too OneNote in one-dimensional and while I look forward to Gucci Mane putting out some projects in the future where he goes a little bit harder takes a few more risks like he did on drop-top WAP I have to anticipate that they're gonna be albums or mixtapes like this along the way where he is just going for some big features he's playing as super safe he is not really doing anything too out of the ordinary and he's not really progressing himself in any way shape or form I feeling kind of like a light too decent five on this thing you know it's not terrible but it there's nothing really to write home about either I would say but what did you guys think of this project did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next let me know down in the comments and I will catch you guys in the next one over here next to my head I will link to me talking about the drop-top WAP project or you can hit the link to subscribe to the channel and you're the best all right little minute forever

kupU1_uOmHw,Oh hi everyone company can tan him here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Saint Vincent album mass seduction Bodhi alert what's with the booty IIIi don't know it's it's it's just the album cover did she drop something she gonna pick it up maybe she is I it's it's possible I guess stop this is the latest full-length album from top-tier indie and art popper miss Annie Clark this is her fifth full-length album under the st. Vincent name it's been ten years since she debuted under this moniker with Mary me nice and it's been interesting watching her create this very lavish and playful chamber pop music with an art pop twist that has progressively gotten quirkier and noisier and weirder reaching peak strangeness on her last full length album in 2014 the self-titled record there were moments on that album that were so odd they were like difficult to stomach and not to say that Annie should stray from the fray for better or for worse I think that's actually when she's coming out with some of her best stuff and going into this new record over here I actually had a fear that she would play it kind of safe on this one given how plain and underwhelming tracks like New York were leading up to the record and she brought on guys like Jack Antonoff to kind of do some songwriting in production and once I heard the entire LP I was kind of surprised to hear that my issues with it were not that it played it too safe but that it was just too half-baked this is a really strange record for st. Vincent like it is easily her most inconsistent album the flow of the tracklist is really awkward too I mean pretty much every record up until this point has had a very strong sonic theme running throughout it mass seduction just seems really unsure of itself by comparison it's a lopsided collection of some of Annie's most bombastic barnburners and subtle ballads not to mention there are a number of tracks on this thing that end on a very underdeveloped note like on the song slow disco which starts off well enough very pretty Chamber Orchestra instrumentation on this thing Annie's vocal harmonies are some of the lyrics are pretty heartbreaking but then the song is just taken away by a single refrain about a minute in and then it coasts on that and just finishes it seems like kind of a cop-out the song young lover is very similar in that it has a very promising start and then it hits a point of repetitive tediousness where this instrumental that's kind of glimmering it's like a bunch of weird sparkling guitars and undefinable sound effects it's interesting for a moment but the tractors kind of hangs in this space Ede Roni limbo until it just plays itself out until it's until it's just tire of itself I guess then we have fear of the future maybe the most inconsequential track on the entire record I'm kind of floored as to how it made it onto this album the instrumental seems like a fusion between New Wave music industrial and like a sleigh bell song but without the cocky fun attitude to it the bustling grinding instrumental does very little for the tune and Annie's vocal performance her vocal acrobatics sometimes just don't really make sense over the the weird digital mayhem that has been created in these beats I think sugar boy is another example of that but anyway this track kind of ends out of nowhere with a sudden synth rush almost as if to acknowledge that that yeah that they didn't really know where they were going with it and New York is the single that had me worried going into this album to begin with and for a very low-key ballad it doesn't stir up much in the way of emotion even as Annie leads this very cool panoramic chorus line that's very epic in in sound but I would say as a very small emotional impact it sounds like a heavily rehearsed reprieves for like a Broadway show or something as opposed to a compelling ballad by comparison the song happy birthday Johnny does way more with way less Annie's intimate vocals sound fantastic the sad and dreary simple chord progression on the piano is criticized me the whole thing cuts like a knife and the vivid storytelling in the lyrics is part of what makes the song just hurts so much to listen to to begin with so while there are a lot of misses on this album when this record hits it really does hit the song pills is easily my favorite single from this entire thing it's a smart piece of detailed synthetic pop there's a jittery fun chorus on this thing I love Annie's quick vocals pills to do pills pills pills just listen to over and over makes me feel like I'm going crazy over all the song seems like a funny statement on how medicated modern society is and the song features easily some of the most bold and gutsy guitar work on the entire record then there's a weird instrumental breakdown in the second half with all this banging clanging metallic percussion some watery psychedelic guitar chords that sound like something out of like the Beatles psych pop era it's a great track I love the title track on here - I love how boldly the track dives into this realm of sexuality talking about how Annie can't turn off what turns her on I love that in her music and her lyrics she continues to be really unapologetic on this topic and just you know it is one of the many things that makes her a more interesting lyricist than a lot of her contemporaries the song dishes out a nice funky groove some very weepy melting vocal harmonies bold guitar leads and one of Annie's most impassioned vocal performances on this entire project - and even though it was kind of cool on loss ageless to begin with um it did grow on me the opening fee melody reads to me is like I don't know an interpolation or like a little bit of a remix of like a Kraftwerk melody as well as the patient pulsating beat on this track the whole thing just kind of reminds me of like the old school of German electronic music there are also some very freaky guitar embellishments on this thing and and the simmering low key verses on this track transition really nicely into the thrilling hooks I would say the song savior is another highlight despite it being as low-key as it is but it is one of the more fully developed tracks in the track listing here but outside of that I mean there's not really much more for me to celebrate on this album at the end of the day this record is kind of a mixed bag it's very directionless it features some of Annie's most fleeting songs some of her most directionless songs and while this record does have its hits they're really too few and far between for this album to be one of her best records yet I'm feeling a light - decent six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry in the comments if you're angry over here next to my header a couple st.

5iHufSOWdqg,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new proto martyr album relatives in dissent this is the latest full-length album from Detroit rock and post-punk band proto martyr it's it's their fourth album fourth album four whole albums congrats boys the band's last album dropped in 2015 the agent intellect which was pretty good you know it was an amazing but showed a lot of promise the lyrics are pretty great a lot of the time the songs were very dreary very compelling very dark the band just had a depressing vibe that I could soak in and the driving guitars and drums had a really classic post-punk sound but as much as I enjoy those very obvious influences from bands like Bauhaus and Joy Division it was all very OneNote like I loved Joe Casey as a vocalist but some of the instrumental performance is on this thing we're kind of boring a little flat the guitar work a lot of the time wasn't anything to write home about the production didn't have a whole lot of bite to it either however their new record over here to my ears feels like a big improvement the band really coming into their own stylistically and instrumentally in a lot of ways I mean for one the drums the guitars the musical compositions overall are way more dynamic you know not just tediously hammering out all these quarter notes and eighth notes the band repeatedly dishes out these danceable yet despondent grooves eerily beautiful chord progressions as well and I would say the lyrics are more dramatic and poetic than ever but don't be mistaken there's a lot of grime and grit on this album too the opening track on this thing is a prime example of that exact balance the band strikes which they carry out throughout much of the album the lyrics are absolutely crushing referencing a moment in Elvis's life around Flagstaff when he had like a bit of a religious epiphany then taking that story further down the road to the point where he would be dead on the bathroom floor then you have like the closing haunting mantra on this song she is just trying to reach you she's just trying to reach you which is met with a wall of distorted guitars and fluttering strings it's a real trip and the record just keeps getting better and better and more interesting from here yeah the very intense and rambling here's the thing Joe's vocals on this track are incredible and very ranty I love the dramatic drumming the grimy bassline the kind of echo drenched garage guitars that kind of reminded me of a band like The Cramps I just wish the song had a more definitive ending though but again thoroughly impressed with the vocals a lot of the time they feel like a emotional or a poetic exorcism like on the song My Children which features all these tents building guitars and like a disjointed diatribe about / creating having kids passing things on to the next generation but it's not it's it's not the most positive track in the world there's kind of a dark side to it as well I also love the lyrics on the song the chuckler which to me Reed is I don't know almost like a message to the audience that they should or that the band is laughing in the face of the darkest things that life and the world has to offer talking about all of it as if it's just one big joke I also love the very jangly tense chord progressions on this track some of the plucky guitar phrasing and the strings that come in later adds so much body to the usually muddy mayhem on this project I also love the frightening instrumental tone that the band brings to the table on the song Windsor hum as well as the very tight and punchy driving don't go and there's this really awesome noisy and pleasant back-and-forth going on on the song up the tower where you have these very sweet kind of dramatic verses that transition into these noisy distorted frenzied sort of refrains where you constantly have shouted over and over knock down knock down I mean the song male plug mo plague is incredibly catchy as well I just love that the band is writing some of the most intricate and interesting and layered and complex instrumentals yet while simultaneously bringing some of their best hooks some of their most heartbreaking lyrics some of their most heartbreaking melodies the band is truly embodying darkness and sorrow in a really tasteful way and pulling it together with just again some some great post-punk style instrumentation with some strings here some keyboards there just to add that extra bit of that little extra embellishment just to provide more sonic flavor the closing track is one of the most grand and beautiful on the entire record and brings back that she's just trying to reach you mantra that the album kicked off with so it is like a little bit of a reprieve or just kind of referencing itself back you know kind of tying the whole album up almost as if there's you know some kind of theme to this whole thing that is going to reveal itself once I listen to it a little bit more as far as some complaints that I have about this record there are a few tracks that were a little under written I think could have had a stronger ending or had a little bit more to them in terms of length the production could have been a bit more crisp though I think the muddiness worked in favor of the album more than it did against it and finally Joe Casey as much as I love his lyrics on this thing and that's definitely a selling point and I think he is a very compelling performer like he definitely delivers some very emotional performances that I connect to and that I enjoy quite a bit having said that though he just more than on any other previous perta martyr album just is such like a dead ringer for a young Nick Cave on this thing to the point where it's it's truly just distracting and I feel that distraction kind of melting away the more that I listen to the project again and again and again but you know if only he could have you know sort of delivered his vocals in a way where Nick caves influences not so painfully obvious on him and I guess finally you know I can say wow this is one of the better post-punk albums I've heard in a while it's not exactly reinventing or pushing the genre forward or anything like that it's just a very good release within that style actually a very great release in that style I'm feeling a decent eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next it the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're angry over here next to my head is another proto martyr review

9pwHvfONtyo,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I thought were the best and the worst tracks of the week they're all linked down there in the description box check them all out if you so please let's get right into it with just a few mentions one our Amazon Associates link down there in the description box if you live in the US and you are going to be buying some stuff on Amazon consider using the link down there in the description box I already said if you're in the US I just want to remind you that again if you're in the US we get kickback from whatever you purchase it does not add to your overall price it's a good way to support the channel and support the segment

vinyl pressings of records that i reviewed on my channel as well as audio equipment turntables speakers you know stuff for your budding record collector and we get kickback from whatever you buy over there too does not add to your overall price treat yourself get yourself some music get yourself a turntable they got some quality stuff over there and that's it the Amazon link and the turntable lab link hit those ups part of the channel it support segments all right let's move on first we have a few shoutouts a1 Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have come together with like a cover of John Carpenter's Halloween that you should definitely check out linked down there in the description box and Death Grips came out with a new like weird electronic drum jam mix remix thing and it's pretty long it's pretty insane and I enjoyed it but you know it's it's not necessarily a single or anything like that it's just kind of like a weird b-side so I didn't toss it into the best worst or mass sections but yeah those two are linked down there in the description box check him out and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the worst tracks oh god they're the worst keep in mind I didn't do a best worst tracks last week so some of these tracks are more than a week old because I tried to play a little bit of catch-up here one Will Smith has a new single out titled get with it and it is the the the rappers first I believe foray into EDM which is odd because II D M is not necessarily the biggest hottest thing right now but Will Smith essentially hops on an EDM instrumental hints toward a bit of a fake patois here and there and the lyrics are awful the Bee is obnoxious and you know what if you want to have a good laugh then give this thing a listen and I guarantee you you will at least walk away with a chuckle that is before you decide to you know hit hit the pause button on that and go listen to something else and then also a Weezer has a new single out which is titled weekend woman which you know it's just another over produced piece of pop rock from this forthcoming record of theirs pretty much every single from this album has left me very cold and very uninterested and you know I'm just kind of worried I'm just I'm just legitimately worried about you know essentially what what this new album is gonna hold I don't think it's gonna be very good you know it seems like with the White Album Weezer were shooting for an older sound and consciously so something that kind of throw to the older fans who you know loved the Blue Album era stuff but now it kind of seems like they're going back to you know everything as usual you know to just I don't know just completely disappoint people who enjoy that era of Weezer you know I I hope they're successful with the record I hope it's well-received by some people by some of their newer fans but I I can already tell now I don't think it's a really gonna be for me but um you know still shout out to Rivers Cuomo for mimin me up on his Instagram page that's always that's always greatly appreciated let's move on to the tracks that I thought were kind of mad I wanted to shout him out I wanted to point him to you but I personally was not crazy for them but you know still worth mentioning new sleighbells track out seems like a little bit of an underwhelming b-side without much structure to it the tune is cool but the guitar strumming gets a little tedious after a while that there's not much to it it's pretty short but I don't know hardcore sleigh bells fans take notice next a ski mask ski mask the slump guide has a new track out featuring offset production by Timberland on this thing be is amazing flow is amazing it's just kind of shortened there's not a whole lot to it you know it's um it's kind of bare-bones it's just kind of a ski mask verse then an offset verse and then it's done you know it is pretty gritty and grimy and Tim Bluemont and Timbaland's production here really kind of steals the show it's absolutely amazing the beat is like so intricate and weird and next level and it so fits ski masks eccentric weird style and delivery so you know all the credit in the world to to him he's a he's definitely a talent and love and what Timbaland is doing here just hoping for something a little bit more full-length and substantive in the future you know waiting for that album waiting for that next mixtape apperent has a new track out the title of it is nature come it's a kind of tame drone in my opinion there are some interesting textures here but it is a not really hitting me it's a you know not quite as exciting or blood pumping or as abrasive as I like a lot of his music to be however from what I understand this is one of many tracks on a forthcoming like three hour album that he has dropping in December and you know this could just be another cut to ends up growing on me in the context of the track listing it's a 14-minute monster and you know go into it with an open mind I guess porches has a new track out titled country this is easily one of the most compelling songs I have heard from this project so far like the recording is great the court progression on here is like really sad and dreary and really kind of tugs at the heartstrings as do the lyrics and the vocals too it's kind of short and from what I understand this is like one of the last songs to be written for the album or the last song in the album and it seems like kind of a bit of a goodbye moment or an introductory moment it's it's a it's a it's a spot that's beautiful but it seems like for me it's probably going to have more impact once I hear it on the album but standalone it's it's a very pretty couple of minutes o'seas or formerly VOCs or OCS or they've gone through so many name changes at this point I have a new record coming out or you have a new record of there's a new record under a different name it's just OCS and this new track over here it's titled the fool now this is not the weird quirky psych punk garage odyssey that you may have heard and enjoyed on their last record I know I certainly did I gave it a very rave review but it is a very kind of dreary weird ballad female vocals on this thing and I don't know it's it's kind of a track that didn't really stick with me as I listened to it more and more but again a slow burner and a track that I could see you know really Wow and once I hear it on the record rather than just kind of the few initial listens to it to do this video the new Mavis Staples track which ended up in the mess section over here actually meant to put it in the best section messed up on that but we'll talk about that once I get to that section the new king cruel track the new album is out I don't want to talk about it too much you know this track could end up wow me a little bit more - but I like the weird experimental rock post-punk direction that kink rule is going in on this new album it's just that the instrumental felt a little tinny and low fine underwhelming to me but you know who knows maybe that's an aesthetic that will kind of a grow on me on the record itself once I try to get a full listen on it this week at a review on it this week John Mouse has a new track out as well which is titled Teenage Witch to me kind of reads like a little bit of uh you know III know that you know he's not necessarily a ripoff of Ariel pink or anything like that but it just kind of reminds me of an Ariel pink song like one that isn't quite as vibrant or is interesting I mean some of the since on here pretty cool you know the vocals are certainly kooky but um it's it's not really doing too much for me I mean it's okay it's alright but you know if you love lo-fi weird hypnagogic pop music then you know please do give this a shot shout out to baths who has a new very weird quirky electronic art pop tune out title out that I thought was okay and all pigs must die have a new track out the title being hostage animal should be out on Southern Lord Records very soon it's heavy its throttling its pummeling like usual with pigs not all must die the vocals aren't you know the most distinct or anything like that but actually thought some of the guitar work on here was a little next-level in comparison with most of their stuff seemed a little bit more technical and intricate and the chords were a bit more interesting the structure of the track was a bit more ambitious than you know your usual kind of thrash and bash hardcore outfit with like a little bit of a you know very heavy sludgy metal twist so shout out to those guys you know it's a decent single and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best tracks this week let's go back over here and let me shout out the new father John misty track pure country which is a wonderful country rendition of the song pure pure comedy which is easily one of my favourite tracks one of them one of my favorite singles of the year and this country version is gut-busting Lee hilarious you know those still the original emotion and beauty of the track does stay maintained in this new country version Westside doom West Side gun and MF doom getting together with another new track over here like this new track over here is really starting to tell me okay you know this forthcoming project West Side doom it really could be a thing and I want it to be a thing especially since this track is good as well I'm loving the eerie strange instrumental here alchemists brought it to the table doom I will say does get out shine by the you know West Side gun here a little bit but I'm still liking their chemistry I'm liking that they can both kind of hop on very odd production like this and come through with a very satisfying track that doesn't feel like you know they're kind of skimping or skipping on anything or you know kind of leaving fans and the dust and just putting something out to put something out you know it is some very good experimental abstract hip hop and I'm just kind of crossing my fingers here that this is a album this is a project that happens you know rather than just kind of getting thrown into the trash bin of history and forgotten like so many projects doom has teased over the years that have just not sort of come into fruition give a shout out to former Weezer bassist in his project the rentals which I guess he's recently revived this single overhear titled Elon Musk is making me sad is a very fun quirky piece of like pop rock with some hilarious lyrics he's essentially kind of singing about Elon Musk like taking him into his like futuristic society like whatever plans Elon Musk has to you know you know leave this world and sort of go somewhere else to start a new society or whatever it's it seems like he wants to be brought on board and I just feel like the the tune is great the lo-fi production is really fun the vocals are very sweet and very catchy the sentiment of the song and kind of the topic of the song is hilarious the song is pretty long it's pretty it's very ambitious and you know there are so many interesting qualities about this track that I think are really cool shout out to Sufjan Stevens who has like this new project out where it's like outtakes and remixes and b-sides from Cary and Lowell and this new track over here is you know kind of one of the b-sides from it it's titled wallow a lake monster and it's a beautiful very quiet ballot it's very much instrumentally in league with a lot of what was on Cary and Lowell you know don't expect anything new but it is very pretty song and you know I could have seen myself enjoying it very much if it ended up landing in the tracklisting I got to give a shout out to Saint and Vincent on the song pills I think it's an excellent track although I'm not going to talk too much about it because I'm going to be reviewing her and new album very soon and I don't want to spoil anything but I do think it's an excellent track Sharon Jones & the dap-kings have a new album coming out very soon it's it's obviously a record that comes after the passing of Miss Jones rest in peace and this is a track over here matter a matter of time obviously is in their usual very energetic and funky soul style and you know there's kind of like a bit of a wonderful message of coming together and you know getting through hard times and so on and so forth coming through the lyrics that's a pretty beautiful pretty inspirational that I like quite a bit and yeah you know it's just all around a good tune a good song and just looking over to the looking forward to the record so yeah there's that next I got to give a shout-out to Shamir who you guys may have remembered I reviewed like that big record he had a little while ago with all those kind of like dance punky track so it was like a lot of LCD soundsystem influence on there it was a little like all over the place it was very much a mixed bag you know just as many lows as there were highs and Shamir has done quite a bit to reinvent himself since the release of that album you know delving into low-five music acoustic music singer-songwriter music and this is kind of the first song or first piece of music from that new string of creation that's actually kind of like wow me and grabbing my attention the song being straight boy and it is well recorded it does have kind of a very simple very sleek but compelling music video and it's just a very endearing simple little guitar tune about just kind of like falling in love seems like kind of there's an element of like being played there being confused you know there's obviously a lot of content in the lyrics addressing sexuality you know queerness you know but does like you know come from a very introspective and a you know very personal place and overall I thought it was a good tune it was a very moving moment that I've heard from from him you know as far as again this recent string of more guitar based and more lo-fi and you know kind of more indie flavored music you know this this is like a track that to me says he definitely sort of has a future in this sound and I'm just kind of looking forward to seeing that kind of blossom I guess no age has a new track out titled snares like a haircut and this is the first song in a while from no age that I've completely loved like this is the first piece of like very noisy experimental slightly poppy punk music that has really kind of floored me from the band like incredible energy coming off this thing the the production is a little low five but they pack it with some interesting distorted and crazy textures and you know there's just a great momentum to the performance on this track too and just looking forward to what they're doing based off of this track because it was really a fun listen Mavis Staples has a new track out a new record I believe it's coming by way of anti records and excuse me the track is tied a little bit and you know it's it's a pretty simple like somewhat bluesy somewhat soulful guitar bass song really it's kind of the the heartbreaking sentiment and story in the lyrics that really kind of sells this one and Mavis is vocal performance I'm not gonna get too much into it other than just to say that I highly recommend you listen to it and you know just kind of hear for yourself what it's all about and finally I got to give a shout out to Julian Baker who has a new track out titled turn out the lights and just like with the last single to come from her forthcoming record this track has an interesting trajectory to or an amazing trajectory to it like it's so simple and it's deceptively simple I would say toward its starting toward its middle to the point where I thought that it was like a tad generic between the vocals and the guitar tone which is a little plain but once it really kind of hits that peak of emotional intensity and you kind of get that big rush of sound coming behind her vocals and she's you know just like crying out in this intensely emotional way as she's kind of in that final moment of the song it's like actually kind of heartbreaking and incredible but again just like with the last track that she dropped she's doing a really great job of kind of building up to these amazing moments of emotional intensity in these Tunes and I mean obviously I hope for more structural variety in this forthcoming record of hers but you know it's it's played off and performed incredibly well here and that's gonna be it guys those are all the songs that I wanted to mention the best tracks the mat tracks the worst tracks and the shout-out tracks that has been the weekly track roundup it's all linked down there in the description thank you very much for watching guys hope you hope you got some good recommendations out of this episode again remember to use those Amazon and tur tape a turntable lab links and I'll see you in the next one you're the best forever [Music]

through with the commercial follow up to his a love letter to you mixtape that came out earlier this year like this past May keeping it prolific on his meteoric rise to fame and as I said he's one of these artists who is part rapper part singer crooning his way from one end of a very mellow extravagant trap instrumental to another which is very much in vogue right now you could really see what trippy red is doing as kind of an extension of the sound that guys like young thug or little Aussie vert have brought to the table there's even a pretty clear Rae sremmurd influence on what he's doing and there are a lot of artists who are on this craze right now it's an ongoing thing I mean I was even listening to that new a boogie with a hoodie album recently and you know it's it's it's very clean very focus group it's uh it's it's alright but while trippy red is very much in the middle of a trend right now I see him having characteristics that set him apart from a lot of his contemporaries for when his vocals are pretty unusual very raw not that doctored sure he does have some auto-tune on his vocals but it's not exactly like that cleans his singing up there a lot of very strange and weird and nasal inflections on his singing that are really really strong which just kind of makes him a little unorthodox and lyrically he's pretty intelligible too he just kind of lets it all hang out there and he's constantly busting these elongated vocal lines where he pushes his lungs to capacity and he's kind of like straining at the end of a note and kind of abrasive especially when he's laying more than one vocal on top of itself and it can get annoying like on the introduction of the song dangerous and I cannot stand his singing at all on the song back back back it's like he's not holding it together at all vocally it's very sloppy it's very noisy which is kind of the case on the song feel good too like he has no composure on this song whatsoever he's slurring his words he is just not on point at all but even when trippy does seem a little bit more put together in a performance he does have some vocal shortcomings that leave a few cuts on here sort of underwhelming like whoa whoa whoa but when trippy is focused his singing is pretty special at least to me it's amateurish yes but it's very pointed it's passionate it's kind of eccentric and in a way it's kind of refreshing in this newly-minted lane of hip-hop it leads to moments on this thing like cuz I'm in dude deep where his vocals just pull off all these like really weird nasal tones that just twist together into these freaky harmonies the song has a very icy cold be some subtly blown out bass cuz I'm in too deep the song dead man's wonderland has these cascading refrains and vocal lines that just kind of flip over one another as they're singing in unison a restrained bassline some ghostly background vocals and then very dreamy keyboards and the song back in my mind is maybe this project's biggest hope for like a pop crossover mostly due though to Cindy with a cease vocal contributions on this one she kills it on the hook she's probably the best singer on this entire thing far and away and that's kind of also including trippy red and the song Hellboy is kind of a surprising turn in the track listing here it is a really dark track that features a somewhat watery and kind of mad lib inspired instrumental like it's a dreary soul sample but it's sort of warp to the point of sounding like like really melty and weird like a great mad lib instrumental does but then there's some very crispy hi-hat some very punchy kicks the flow on here kind of reminds me of little B and this is easily one of the most meaningful tracks on the entire record to like maybe the first moment where trippy is singing legitimately strikes me as being forlorn as well as his rapping on here to which given how good it is on this track I just don't think he does it enough honestly on this track Trippi shows a level of emotional maturity that a lot of his competitors are and I would love to hear more of that going forward now while I do think the tape hits a very strong middle point with a lot of strong tracks back to back to back the song overweight has some of the worst lyrics on this entire thing while I wasn't expecting a lot out of this lyrically you cannot come through with this first greater rhyme pattern and make it sound slick and then he starts patting the project out with these shorter cuts that don't really add that much to the tracklisting and then the finishing track let me down I mean it's kind of dreamy but it just sounds like an extended improvisational vocal cut over like a Brian Eno ambient instrumental which I guess in theory sounds kind of cool but in practice it's not as hard-hitting or as memorable as anything that came before it overall with this tape I have to say I feel indifferent however that's not because I feel like it was this uniformly bland and boring thing the issue is is that this project is such a mixed bag songs that I truly do not like on any level meanwhile other tracks that I think are honestly some of the best I've heard this year when it's at its best it's emotionally stirring its cutting edge and very bold very tuneful and I don't know all I can do is just kind of cross my fingers here and hope that the diamond-in-the-rough that I'm hearing on this thing eventually fully reveals itself on another tape on an album I don't know I'm feeling a decent of strong 5 on this thing transition have you given

PWsug6Lx-V8,boy oh boy hi everyone oh boy Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Marilyn Manson album heaven upside down Lord of darkness and shock rocker Marilyn Manson he is back with his 10th full-length album here one of my most anticipated rock records of the year not only because I thought the lead-up singles to this album were pretty good but also in this third leg of Manson's career he's kind of been on an upward trajectory beginning with a very rough start on born villain in 2012 I could appreciate Marilyn Manson embracing more of his post-punk influences on this thing and transitioning over from Interscope to a more independent venture but the recording and the production on this thing in my opinion was hideous I mean whatever this album was Chris Rena who also worked on the high end of low could could not save this thing Manson would eventually go on to work with music producer and film composer Tyler Bates who would help him come through with a somewhat heart bounce back on the pale Emperor a few years ago an album that would show Marilyn Manson channeling some of his old-school industrial rock ferocity once again but then also bringing in some classic hard rock into the fold some of these hard rock influences did play out a little awkwardly on this album but there was certainly potential there and rather than going through another reinvention it seems like Marilyn Manson and one of his greatest musical collaborators Twiggy Ramirez as well as Tyler Bates once again are kind of trying to hone the sound that they struck upon with pale emperor which is admirable but but I wouldn't say their efforts really truly pan out initially with the singles and actually my first few listens to the album I was kind of impressed with the raw crunchy industrial rock riffs on this thing but as I listened more I found that there's just so little to this album beyond that I mean the opening track reads like a toothless version of the irresponsible hate anthem and unfortunately Manson just continues to live as a hammer without a nail or a gun without a target as evidenced in just how tepid and general a lot of the lyrics on this record are which a lot of the time don't really venture beyond Manson's usual blasphemous them Maddox which honestly is still a weird position to see him in I mean maybe it would have made sense for him to to be here in this spot he's not quite as controversial as he used to be like five or six years ago but now in 2017 we live in an age of Trump people are more sensitive and outraged than ever the fact that Marilyn Manson is doing so little to guide or channel this cultural fire is kind of disappointing especially given his status as a showman and as a social lightning rod as Manson said on mechanical animals on the song rock is dead the shock it's all in your head which is true but he used to be great at getting in people's heads and that just doesn't seem to be the case anymore especially on this new album and I think there's a lot more to it than his time just being over or people just being desensitized to him most likely it's a result of Manson using his music now as more of a refuge than a weapon which I can't entirely blame him for I can't imagine what it's like to be public enemy number one much less keep that reputation up for one decade after another but still Manson makes numerous lyrical references on this album to his usual targets as if his statements have the same impact they used to and they don't which again is sad because I feel like now we need a Marilyn Manson more than ever an artist that's gonna desperately bite at society's cultural wounds like a rabid wolf but again just not the case given that some of the lyrics on this thing are so inoffensive bordering on unintentionally hilarious suck it up snow wipeouts uh it just sounds like really bad coked up goth rock from the 80s and when it comes to the subject of religion and Christian iconography Manson just has nothing all that revolutionary to say at this point it's like he's not just beating the dead horse but he's constantly just stabbing it with a cattle prod of course there are moments on this record as Manson has often been in some of his second act and third act albums where he gets kind of introspective and reflective on his image on his fame on his status in popular culture blood honey seems to be the most prime example of that with Manson singing about how his audience loves to see him upside down in a way clearly he feels on happy with the idea of being used and then left or sort of being no more than an object for his audience which surely is true to an extent but is somewhat of a mischaracterization at least from the standpoint of me as someone who loved his music in the past because III don't love hearing Marilyn Manson himself upside down I love hearing it when he's turning the world upside down although I guess the world is kind of already upside down right now because there are scarier things than Marilyn Manson still it's an incredibly anguished moment on the album emotionally crippling to an extent even if the mix is kind of messy with the keyboards like sounding way too loud and they just do not slip into the guitars and drums that that nicely there are at least a couple tracks that I could see myself returning to maybe Saturnalia being one of them which is easily the best post-punk throwback on the entire record the nocturnal groove coming out of the drums the nimble bassline the Spacey production and the whole performance feels like a almost like a loose Jam there's a roaring hook on this thing and I'm definitely feeling like vibes coming from the cure or Bauhaus but with like a bit of a an alt metal twist the song also hits one of the highest vocal intensity points for Manson toward the end of the track - and then you have the very brooding kill from a loaded with dirty bass really slick guitar licks a very simple kick clap pattern it's dark it's sexy it's sensual there's a sweet glassy chorus on this track that sort of throws back to the mechanical animals era and the lyrics are filled with these cultish nods to blood pacts and complete control there are moments where I feel like the album is really lacking vocally Manson's tortured moaning and shouting come off somewhat awkward and strained like on the song tattooed and reverse oh god be bridled of course meanwhile all the hard rock riffs that Manson finds himself on top of with this record while they're a little better executed like it sounds really clean it sounds really well produced but musically it's kind of run-of-the-mill and it sort of takes the wind out of the sails of the record especially on the closer and the title track I mean this kind of instrumental backing just as very little to build up Manson's image as does this album as a whole because much of it in my opinion is very deflated it's flaccid it's a couple of great tracks a handful of moments that are admirably personal but it's not like Manson hasn't reflected on his transition from shock rocker to just rocker I could see the hardcore fans being more into this than I am but honestly I was pretty indifferent toward this thing like the tunes on this record a lot of the time are just simply okay some of the lyrics are incredibly disappointing and extremity and controversy are just so integral to Manson's band that to see him not deliver them in spades yet again it just leaves me feeling kind of cold on this record feeling a light too decent five on this thing transition have you given this album uh listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it here the best year the best what should I review next hit the like feel

IFyq9sXtSRc,hi everyone Bethany yes Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new poppy album poppy poppy poppy computer this is the debut full-length album from internet icon YouTube sensation poppy who a lot of my fellow youtubers may know from her incredibly insane video series where she dazzles and confuses her fans with a pastel color palette a lot of strange questions and statements that usually focus on pop and internet culture god technology cults it's strange I love the internet and its kind of because the world that poppy projects herself from in her videos it's almost like it's it's not of this earth or that she is not of this earth like she's a cyborg that is talking to people for data collection or like an alien trying to make heads or tails of this world that she's suddenly been transported to all these dudes just fawning over a thin blond girl with a young face and not even thinking that one day a rain of UFOs are gonna come down on this planet thousands more of her gonna beam down with laser cannons to enslave the human race toss us into harvesting pods we're gonna be routinely shaved our hair is gonna be a power source man well you know before any of that happens we do have this album to review which papi built up to with the very bubbly bubble bath EP and last year's 3:36 music to sleep to which was kind of a surprise ambient record both of which were cool I mean the former was catchy but it seemed almost disconnected or out of place from Poppy's whole sort of aesthetic and world that has been created on YouTube like there's something almost a little too human about her music that remote eerie stillness just kind of isn't present but still I think pop music is a genre that makes sense for poppy it's a lane where I feel like she needs to be because as strange as her videos are and as smart as her videos are I feel like there's something kind of playful and cheeky and self-aware about them too like it's it's kind of being like junk food but time Dainius Lee it's it's trying to say something deeper now the lead singles from this record were saying to me that poppy was finally finding a way to continue making pop music but have it be I guess more in spirit with what people have come to expect from her video series songs like computer boy as well as a software update both of which were very chewy bits of synth and electro pop with these candy-coated bleepy bloopy instrumentals self-aware lyrics that tie together the worlds of love and technology talking about how she wants your floppy disk to be her hard drive that's oh man that that landau nice when or talking about reprogramming that this person who you are with because I he's like he's not he's not satisfying you like like like it seems like in a sexual way and there are a lot of quirky choruses on these tracks too which are equal parts sleek and cute for me this direction for me the sound an aesthetic totally makes sense for poppy but there are only a few other tracks on this record that firmly stand in this world the song interweb another pretty well crafted track on here much slower in pace much more brooding in a way it's kind of got this nocturnal yet also disco kind of groove to it it's sort of dreamy as well and there are a lot of clever lyrics on here likening the Internet to a web that you get caught in or like a trap like a trap that poppy catches you in with her content or you have the song my style which is another very laid-back and groovy cut in between the verses on this thing are woven in a lot of the strange mantras that you might catch in your usual poppy video poppy as your best friend poppy as an object etc and then there's Poppy's musical modus operandi on the song I'm poppy that opens the entire record up P o PP by I'm poppy B OPP by what one of the sharpest melodies on the entire project easily now a lot of the deeper cuts on here though they kind of depart from this lyrical direction they kind of depart from this sonic aesthetic which I'm not against in theory but it seems like when poppy is approaching other sounds other styles not only does she kind of lose touch with what people know her for as an Internet icon but also it it's kind of like she starts creating music that's a little more average for the genre that she's existing within at that moment like there are a few j-pop style cuts on here like moshi moshi which is almost like a little bit of a keyboard ballad it is a pretty tune it's not one of the most interesting instrumental moments on the entire record but a song of this tone and of this emotional quality certainly needed to be placed on the album and lyrically it seems kind of like a little bit of a nod to the Japanese fans of poppy of which there are very many but then the song make of video almost seems like it's it's well crafted but at the end of the day to me it sounds like a kero kero benito like b-side especially as poppy is putting on this really girlish affectation on her voice singing about you know being on the mic in the studio again it's another moment where I feel like poppy is revealing that she's actually human a little bit too much it's a little too glitzy it's a little too fruity it doesn't really kind of bring that weird intensity that I get from a video that it's like staring deeply into my soul the mark seems even more out of focus on the bratty guitar driven my microphone as well as on the song fuzzy whose chorus is maybe one of the most lyrically weak spots on the entire record there are moments on this record where it feels like poppy as well as titanic's and Clare are coming together and creating almost like an image or somewhat of a parody of a pop star or a pop artist kind of reminding me of some of the names to come out of the PC music camp like Hannah diamond or something like they're obviously making pop music but simultaneously sort of making a bit of a statement on it and then there are tracks where it's like poppy is just dipping her toes so far into the water that it's like she's just literally making what she's consciously sort of you know what I'm saying right almost like the whole YouTube side of this is just an elaborate ruse to get us to listen to a regular pop record which hey you know honestly is is not is not a bad thing I mean I think it's a you know admirable and and certainly preferable that artists get a little bit more ambitious when it comes to their visual aesthetic when it comes to their internet presence and I think there are a lot of things about this particular pop record that makes it a very good one it's light-hearted its well-meaning it kind of brings this sense of joy that I feel like the genre should early embody but as well crafted and is unique in internet figure papi maybe I'm yet to hear that same kind of definition in her music however still there's an incredible amount of talent and potential on this thing it shows up in the best tracks here it just needs to be capitalized on more consistently in the track listing I'm feeling a decent six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next if the like feel like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comma in the comments if you're angry over here next to my head is a cara cara bonito review you can also click on the link to subscribe to the channel and i will see you guys in the next one poppy pop be computer forever 
6GcG0qDqWhY,hi everyone puffin in platinum here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new cool Ella album take me apart this is the debut full-length album from R&B song stris Co Ella who built slowly up to the point of this project with a mixtape back in 2013 an EP from a few years ago hallucinogen both of which put her pretty firmly in the alternative R&B lane but in my opinion she was yet to truly stick out in her growing crowd of contemporaries especially on track she released with arca on production who's been known to work with artists like fka twigs who she kind of shared an eerie similarity to on those particular tracks now it's a couple of years later and it's a new album bold daring cover over here and I just kind of went into this thing hoping that she would finally just truly define herself within this style of music and on this record I would say she's more or less there there are a wealth of producers on this thing I mean sometimes numerous producers on a single track bringing back guys like Ariel right right as well as ARCA GM City quests who handle pretty much a bulk of the beats on this thing and this record is pretty uniform in its stylistic concept bringing together the melodic fundamentals of classic R&B from the 80s and 90s with instrumentals that sound like they're kind of from the year 3000 I would call it far and be cuz it's like it's like R&B but it's it's far and it's far into the future no okay alright the instrumentals maintain this sensual yet icy kind of tone their vast they're ambitious in some respects they kind of remind me of some of the work Bjork has put out over the years which can play pretty abstract and artsy like even in its funkiest moments I wouldn't call this album very funky like at the end of truth or dare so there is something kind of alien about this record there is something that does kind of separate it from most commercial R&B music however coelus vocals really truly do sweeten the deal on a series of beats that if left totally without vocals you might think this record is just a little bit more obtuse than it is for the most part her singing on this thing is really beautiful it's really direct the resonating atmosphere on these records gives echoes of not only close contemporaries but also artists like Janet Jackson maybe some old school TLC even a touch of little dragon and the whole thing just manages to stay subtle yet catchy at the same time the album is relentlessly passionate too in kalilas vocal lines a lot of the time are pretty bold which is certainly the case right out of the gate on this thing with the song front line which from a lyrical standpoint is pretty empowering but there are plenty of cuts on here as well where Colella shows a lot of vocal restraint drawing the audience in with a more intimate sound mostly on the song better which is kind of a confessional moment on the album about longing for someone separating from them in hopes that it's going to help the relationship that you're trying to save so not only are the songs consistently impressing me Colella herself as a vocalist is consistently impressing me more than she has on her previous efforts but there are a lot of moments here where the instrumentals surely do steal the show - like on the title track - this thing which has a pretty large credits list on the production side which is not surprising because this B is so weird and intricate with its skittering percussion and it's like 80s synth-pop instrumental break in the second half the dramatically placed kick drums and this indescribable like whooshing sound that is all over the song it just sounds like it's from another world the song enough features these primal drum circle rhythms and these roaring monolithic tones that sort of roar out into forever it reminds me of a few moments from fka twigs LP one but just more gargantuan more panoramic a more enveloping sound occasionally punctuated with these strange metallic clinks the Warped and kind of wonky bassline on the song blue light is certainly a sound to the whole than the track listening here and on the song let me know if I'm not mistaken all over the track it sounds like there have been sampled like opening soda cans soda cans opening some watery lead guitars a sparkling synth line a bobbing kick clap pattern the production overall on this thing is pretty cutting edge and really impressive and not only is it very stimulating from a textural standpoint but from a musical standpoint as well some of the chord progressions the synth leads and there are moments on the record that I love purely for the tune at the core of the song to go back to the track let me know incredible single or the track on and on we to me is like you know could almost be like a sleeper hit from this record it features one of the most tense and compelling vocal lines on the entire record there are some bustling percussion and some cinematic strings on this track too and then there's the very dancing and airy waitin which is maybe the most groovy track on the entire project originally a song that was a little bit too steeped in atmosphere for me to be excited about it at first but with repeat listens it really has grown on me meanwhile the final track is a very mellow almost like 80s style R&B ballad like closer with an extra helping of atmosphere to kind of match with the somewhat icy and futuristic tone of the record I mean honestly I don't have a lot of complaints about this thing other than that I mean sure it sounds like a lot of other alternative R&B albums out there but there's that extra sort of edge that extra notch of vocal ability that extra care and focus when it comes to the lyrics that extra bit of instrumental adventure that sure while this album isn't exactly reinventing the alternative R&B wheel it's still really beautiful it's still really smart it's still really bold and it's a great representation of how cutting-edge this genre of music can be given the right artists given the right producers there are moments where I feel like maybe the record was a little bit overly long or was kind of padded out with these shorter tracks that sort of seemed to give the audience a bit of a breather between these longer more patient slow burning cuts but outside of that I really do enjoy this record and it's easily one of the better R&B projects I've heard this year feeling a decent strong 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I have you next you know you please I'll cry please don't die eat your fruits and vegetables stay hydrated all that stuff and over here next my head is in fka twigs review or you can click on the link to subscribe to the channel and that's gonna be it guys cool I'll see you in the next one Kella taking apart forever

anyV0owqOxg,hey everyone reasons that goes fine ghostwriting is okay rappers are entertainers rappers are like any other artistic discipline out there now especially as the genre has become an international music sensation they are no different in my opinion than singers and songwriters of other breeds who you have guys over the decades and decades of popular music like Elvis Presley Frank Sinatra Michael Jackson all of whom and many more did not write some of their best songs or had co-writers on some of their best songs and the thing is that was not necessarily a bad thing because they were also performers they were also you know sort of icons in their own right I don't see rappers at this point again as any different while hip-hop has had this requirement in the past for the story that the person is spitting to either be a live story that they themselves experience or know intimately secondhand from some other kind of source or have at least written themselves these days I don't think that requirement needs to be placed on two rappers especially in the mainstream anymore of course they're going to be rappers in the mainstream and in the underground as well who stick to telling their own story and writing their own lyrics and that's totally fine original content is important but I think especially today that there is room for both approach it has been fine it's been fine in the past my next point is that it's been fine while ghost writing is certainly a taboo in hip-hop right now you mean to tell me throughout the entire history of the genre that there's never been a ghost written lyric there's never been a ghost written verse there's never been a one artist ghost writing for another artist or something I mean in the NWA movie you had Ice Cube being depicted as because it was true writing lyrics for other members of the group and that was just fine because ultimately at the end of the day all that matter was that the song came out good I don't get what this ridiculous requirement is is doing to help the genre if ultimately some very good songs out there are ghost written songs who if we were to require and sort of you know really kind of set a hard-line rule against this in all circumstances there are probably some really great songs and really great verses that we never would have heard it's good collaborating is good moving out from there collaboration is good you cannot expect a rapper to long term put out great refreshing exciting cutting-edge music for decades and decades and decades if they don't reach out side of their comfort zone and get in touch with other artists get influenced by other artists take source material from other places especially kids considering how how much hip hop is based on borrowing like from its hooks to its samples to its instrumentals to the interpolations that are placed into a lot of the songs both old and new why is all that acceptable as soon as it becomes about lyrics it's like whoa hey whoa you you really stepped over a line there you stepped over a line borrowing those lyrics you stepped over a line getting somebody else to write those lyrics for you those lyrics they got to come from you they have to come from you now the the really awesome and amazing and immaculate jazz samples that are placed throughout the track that are part of what truly make the song beautiful and musical and appealing and catchy those can come from another place but the lyrics they got to come from you they gotta go from me I get why this would have been a requirement if this was like 1988 or 1993 but it's not 1993 its 2017 song quality is the most important thing song quality ultimately is the most important thing it's the most relevant thing it's the most significant thing nothing is more significant than that song quality do people care about the song do people enjoy the song people listen to the song do people buy the song it's a song in the charts is on influencing other artists is a song breaking new ground a ghostwritten song can do all of these things a ghostwritten song can be all of these things so if ghostwriting doesn't necessarily lead to more mediocre music then why is ghost writing such a bad thing you could make the argument that some of these rappers out there right now need a ghostwriter we could maybe use a little bit more ghost writing who the hell knows and ghost writing is not just simply writing a 16 for somebody to spit it's also deciding what the flow is going to be potentially writing a hook as well so there's a lot to ghost writing and it's not like the idea of a ghost writer or a rap song writer behind the scenes it's not like we don't have that in other genres of music I mean guys like we read for example came up in the music industry first before the Velvet Underground and all that as a songwriter as a songwriter and you had guys back in the day who would work in these big record label buildings just writing songs for other people to perform more popular more famous artists who actually were out there on the stage it's not all about writing it's also about performance and vision and finally performance and vision are also significant when you're an artist it's not just simply all about writing somebody can write you the most fantastic song the most fantastic set of six teens two verses in the world but if you're not actually proficient at rapping and you don't have the vision to finally turn that set of verses into a good song working with a good producer finalizing the track to the very end and making sure that it ends up being a good musical product then that person's writing is is going to be for nothing because you you have to actually be able to execute that is something that requires ability an artist even if you are grabbing ghost written lyrics you have to have the foresight to see those lyrics and know that those lyrics are good lyrics know that those lyrics are lyrics that you want to have in your song know that that hook that was written is a hook that you think actually pops I mean there are tons of artists out there like Rihanna for example people are stumbling over themselves to write a song for Rihanna to sing and she rejects tons of songs all the time and I'm sure many other artists on her level do as well and you know it's not just simply you're a pop artist or you're Drake and anybody who throws a song your way you're like yeah I'll do that song yeah but because just because you know I mean it's being written for me so why not because often when this ghostwriting is coming your way it's not fully finished it's a rough sketch of an idea it's not a fully produced in a completed song I've heard instances of producers sending artists who I've had contact with songs and you know I've been sent this song they want me to perform this or they think that I would sound good on this song or they think that I would sound good performing this song and often the track that they've been sent sounds like shit and that's because it's sort of a rough idea they are going to take this idea and basically fully form it in the studio through the process of performing and honing it and discussing about what works and what doesn't because you don't know whether or not that song once you finally get that artist in the studio is that going to play to their strengths is going to be altered in some kind of way from the process of recording it to actually mixing it and balancing it having more sounds taking sounds out tons of things can't happen between these two points from point A to point B and you have to be a good artist with vision and taste to carry it out from this rough idea whether this idea came from you or it came from someone else to actually follow through and have it be a hit track that carries your career to the next level so ghostwriting overall not a bad thing and these are the six reasons in my opinion why do the best over here next to my head is another video check that out and I'll see you guys in the next one for ever [Music] 
eir7AorIVXg,hi everyone the state of bata bata bata bata dear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new uncommon NASA album written at night this is the latest full-length LP from new york rapper and producer uncommon nasa this is his fourth studio album under this name and it is the first album where he I guess he's produced the entire thing himself which is exciting to hear I do love NASA's very clunky noisy textured beat production instrumentals that sound like they've been fermented in the cluttered and gritty New York underground that he comes from which he took a break from on his last record halfway featuring instrumentals from black tokyo all over that project which were kind of skeletal kind of dark underwhelmed me a little bit but i understood how they were supporting the theme of the record the existential obsession with middle age and death and while written at night is nowhere near as morbid it's still a very dark project i guess because we live in very dark times the concept is literally centered around being written or being created at night uncommon nasa putting marker to paper in the wee hours taking direct inspiration from these feelings of isolation of paranoia being tired jaded but also creative and this album in a lot of ways is deeply political too it's almost like NASA is writing this as a response to being kept awake at night because of I guess the insanity of our current political state as if that's just kind of intensifying these negative feelings and giving him insomnia or something and the instrumentals while they do kind of have this somewhat muddy and loaf I like dirty old hip-hop underground cassette tape from 1995 aesthetic to them they're also very spacious and dark and occasionally dreamy there are even moments on this thing that I would call frightening or eerie or surreal there's a strong feeling of alienation on this album to which essentially kicks the entire record off with the song grown apart with lyrics about friends dominating your time and like a really selfish or an inconvenient way uncommon NASA continuing with these themes of kind of being a self-admitted curmudgeon of course he raps this over these very loose guitar chords and drum fills it's very traumatic it's very expressive and of course he continues with his idiosyncratic rap style which borders on like spoken word and slam poetry now the following tracks continue to deliver just these very moody and very introspective thoughts the song compass is all about the long roads that one might need to take in this journey we call life all leading back home bringing us back to our roots our family our loved ones this is something that also guest rapper on the track guilty Simpson emphasizes with his verse talking about being like this nomadic dude on tour performing and the beat features all these scattered drums a couple of heavy and sour organ chords caked and grime meanwhile the song extra lives contrasts that with a very fluid and a very hypnotic beat and these watery cycling synths that almost create like this hip-hop dream state and the lyrical angle of the track is interesting to NASA rapping about essentially the potential of everything he's worked for everything he loves kind of being torn away from him the track is essentially about fears shortcomings insecurities open mike eagle is a guest rapper on the track and enhances those themes with his verse talking about his fear of police or his inadequacies talking about how the place where he lives isn't quite as nice as a lot of his friends the self-doubt he deals with as an artist and the hook on this thing is so sharp and refers very smartly I think to computer technology with uncommon NASA saying don't attack us create a backup like I guess creating a backup for all the things that you don't want to lose I think Berry McLane's vocals on the track are just a little loud like they're not smooth into the beat as much as they could be however in a sense this does sort of add to the rough weird and somewhat lo-fi aesthetic that uncommon NASA is known for the track also kind of fills itself with more weird and strange noises some of which are like these very textured pieces of like 8-bit percussion like very crunchy very brittle but moving on to the next track small change which in my opinion is a perfect sentiment given just how little progress politically in societally I think we made over the past eight years and how quickly a lot of that stuff is being undone now given the current administration the track is titled small change and it's about just change being small being insignificant so little progress it's almost like there's no progress and all over this cut you have a series of rappers hailing from the UK which is fantastic to me especially given how good some of them are especially King Kashmir of a strange you is on this thing he has a hilarious line on this thing where he's rapping about reacting to a really inspirational Facebook posted this is gonna change the world but then he sort of steps on that possibility by just you know saying no and rejecting that between the guest verses on this thing uncommon NASA's verse on this thing the whole track adds up into this idea that humanity as much as they'd like to be inspired as much as they want to see good things happening and change happen they lack the inherent ability or unwilling to do the work internally that needs to be done in order to actually make that change commence there's also a very clinky and bubbly synth line on this thing more 8-bit sounds I'm catching here which I think are fantastic like texturally so good and then you have the very chilling song God's aim which instrumentally doesn't just sound like a dream it sounds kind of like a nightmare it's like this introspective rap anthem with uncommon NASA rapping about how your plans and God's plans may not necessarily line up sometimes and the way he puts it poetically he's really truly on some twilight zone and the album gets even more nightmarish from here now keep in mind there are numerous tracks in the track listing where you have tagged on to the track title a mention of what time it's supposed to be midnight 2 a.m. 3 a.m. 4 a.m. and the deeper into these wee hours you get the darker and more tortured almost the album gets you have the patient which to me lyrically is another incredibly smart angle on the album the track is essentially about the insanity of the modern day or as NASA puts it the mainstreaming of disgusting and it's essentially about being told hey you know this is all normal this is all okay or you know nothing crazy is happening now so what ends up happening to NASA and his guests features on this thing is that they kind of internalize that insanity and then end up feeling crazy themselves as if their reactions their legitimate reactions to how off-the-rails things are becoming are illegitimate the way that they kind of frame it is as if they are mental patients being into the loony bin when there's really actually nothing wrong with them and again this is another moment on the record where I'm just really impressed with how much the guests add to a particular story or a narrative on a track uncommon NASA does something on this record that I feel like a lot of rappers and a lot of artists don't do well enough when they bring guests on their records and that's bring a certain level of expectation that's bring an idea a concept that they want this person to stick or adhere to in a very clear and in a very direct fashion it's almost like this album is a movie and he's kind of just playing director now I'm not entirely crazy about the beat on this track there are some sinister qualities to it that I think are very enjoyable but there's an incredibly loud and farty bassline to it that's very incessant very repetitive that I think kind of distracts a little bit but still I am so heavily impressed with the sense of collaboration on this track that it doesn't really take away from it for me especially given just how intense some of the vocal performances are then there's the very twisted looking back who's powerfully dark instrumental plays very nicely off of the southern twang radiating off of the opening wrap feature on this track from skip Coon the song overall kind of being about losing touch with your own past or your past self now from here the album seems to get a little edgier not just simply darker on the song black hole where you have this revving cycling base which in in a sense is almost like dubstep ish the instrumental and the guest feature here is just super gruff to me it reads a little bit like it's trying too hard to be a dark and and angry like it's a tense that sounding evil or coming off kind of cartoonish and somewhat silly but that's also the vibe I catch on the following track gingerbread hag which at this point it just seems super intentional to me we're not only you have this really raspy animated rap verse from Bruce auskey but also the schmaltzy walking jazz bass line and these like wailing guitars that are super distorted and this very kooky silly and somewhat sourly melody I never do pepper deep it's also like a little devilish it's very Tom Waits Ian it's it sounds like it's a sample of a Tom Waits track or something or trying to sound like a Tom Waits song although I've heard the man's entire discography so if this was a Tom Waits sample it it would reveal itself to me which one it was but the and also NASA's vocals on here in the chorus and the mantra of being consumed on this thing is just so shouted and so insane and so over-the-top things on this record are kind of just getting more out of control now while it was a little rough getting to this heightened intensity point I still do like the fact that the album across its track listing does have a really interesting emotional and sonic progression to it it has a great flow and this noisy and aggressive and and jazzy peak creates a nice sort of space for a calm after the storm for the final title track on here which I have to add has an amazing choice for features quality Chris and Billy woods both of whom have very distinct voices very distinct rap styles that I think play against this type of theme this type of sound this type of concept very nicely especially toward the end of quality Chris's verse who has the final verse on this entire record and his words really kind of tie up the entire theme and concept of this album very nicely as far as things that I think took away from this album there were a few beats that I thought were a little annoying or didn't really work or gel for me and maybe you could throw the idea out there that there are too many features on this thing because there are a lot of features because going into this record I guess I was expecting to hear a little bit more uncommon NASA given that the album is titled after him however even on the moments when he's not rapping you can tell and sort of see very obviously that he is influencing the thematic and the conceptual undercurrent of every single verse in every single track here since it's very clear that he talked with his guests on this thing and gave them an idea of what direction to take their lyrics in because of what the song is about I think maybe the album took a little bit time to really truly get going like I felt that there were moments of speaker truth that were a little underwhelming and that maybe the album could have used like a bit of an epilogue from NASA to really kind of bring the whole idea of the album home but outside of that I mean this record was really well produced well performed well cast the concept is really well executed and this whole thing just kind of goes to show why uncommon NASA is one of the more unique rappers out there right now this thing is also a pretty punchy 44 minutes NASA does a lot in a very short period of time on this record I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it

2UZqIIy7pAk,"Hey everyone. Anthony Fantano here,
Internet's busiest music nerd. And it's time for a ""stinkpiece"", where I have to... [chuckles] ... defend myself from
being accused of pandering to the alt-right. And I guess, uh... let's just get into it. The article starts off well enough, saying I'm
the most famous music critic. That's true, thank you. But then quickly gets into,
I guess, the heart of the matter. And that is my now-dead meme channel, thatistheplan. The writer talks about the channel, as if it were intended to be some kind of TND off-shoot. Even though it precedes TND, and was originally just a channel I used to use, to go and just enjoy YouTube, as a YouTube user. But then, as TheNeedleDrop fanbase grew, and the channel got bigger, and I needed a place to put other forms of content, like vlogs, or just videos where I would give random thoughts on music. I would put them there, and occasionally I would experiment with these funny, disingenious shitpost videos. Where I would freak out about being name-checked by things like Pitchfork, or Vice, or the band Swimmers recently. Where I would just get really angry, and totally unreasonable. As the article points out, I started putting out
these ""incriminating"", meme-y shitpost videos. One, where I talked about this annoying guy,
who was comparing Pokémon Go to dog fighting. Because they're not comparable, it's not the same thing. Another video, where I lampooned the idea of changing your gender, because of Donald Trump. Because I was responding to another video, that insinuated that as a man, you should feel ashamed, that Donald Trump is a guy and you're a guy. As if I'm somehow responsible, or feel some kind of connection to him through his masculinity. Which I don't, I just think he's a scumbag. And then, the article brings up my video where I talked about Pepe the Frog, triggering Hillary Clinton. Spoiler: she wasn't actually triggered, it's- it's a joke. Which is kinda funny, that this video comes up in this article, that's trying to paint me as being alt-right. Because, this is easily one of the most liberal videos, that were on the channel. I made this video as a response to the fact, that Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media in general, were blowing up the alt-right. Providing legitimacy to guys like Richard Spencer, and racist Internet trolls looking to co-opt meme culture, specifically figures like Pepe the Frog. Rather than actually providing progressive policies in her platform, to bring over the progressive side of the Democratic party. And the mainstream left was just... letting them have it! So, you're telling me, that within the span of like the couple months, like, 30 or so people, have essentaily turned this meme, that was perviously enjoyed by millions,
into a white supremacy symbol? I mean, that's not really how memes work, because if it was, then I simply could, using the hashtag #MakePepeGreatAgain, because there are definietly 20 to 30 people in my audience willing to do this. Associate Pepe, instead of with Nazi propaganda - Allied Powers propaganda. We could have Uncle Sam Pepe, Rosie the Rivetor Pepe, Buy war bonds Pepe. And this was one of many joke videos on my meme channel, with a pretty obvious liberal slant. I had ""Top 5 Reasons Barack Obama Was A Great President!!!"", which was kinda funny... mostly ridiculous. ""Top 5 Donald Trump Cabinet Picks!!!"", where every single cabinet pick was actually a cartoon villain from a famous animation. I know, it was- it was a pretty genius idea. Doctor Claw as Secretary of Education - I fully agree with this. And I have to come out and say, how strongly I agree with this, because there have been people that, disgustingly so, have been calling Doctor Claw's PhD into question! So what, if Doctor Claw didn't go to some hoity-toity, Liberal Arts 4-year university? Online university is perfectly fine.
No shame at all in getting an online degree, guys. My ""Bernie vs. Hillary MEME REVIEW"", where I gave Sanders primary one, the 21 air horn salute. *air horn* *air horn again* And a rap song, that I recorded when I was upset,
that Democratic congressman had voted ""nay"", on a bill, that would allow us to import cheaper drugs,
that would save lives and save money, from Canada. Tell 'em you want affordable prescriptions! You voted against that Bernie shit
Why? What's wrong with it? It's our drugs at a lower price
If you pass it now, that'd be really nice Which, when you're done with this video, please,
do something that matters, and actually contact your local congressperson, and tell them,
that you still want this to happen. So, next the article pushes this idea,
that I've- I've become an edgelord. Dun-dun-duuunn!! And the first ""shocking reveal"" is this photo. Is this photo of me, during a video,
where I'm parodying Hopsin fans. And the full reveal of this photo was this:
The man is hanging himself with toilet paper. Toilet paper - not a noose. Which if you didn't know, has been a pretty viral Internet meme over the past year or so, kids. Blowing up on platforms, like the now-defunct Vine, just kind of uh... Hanging themselves with toilet paper in the bathroom,
and like, dropping off to their bathtubs. And off of sharing this meme, you're going to insinuate that I'm an alt-righter, and that I'm racist, and I want people - specifically black people - to be hurt? The article then goes on, to paint my connections to the music board on 4chan. Which there are connections, I used to go on there before TheNeedleDrop was even a thing, pretty regularly. And the article acts, like I conciously gained this audience, by being some kind of manipulative meme-master, when the fact of the matter is, they came to me. Like, the /mu/ section of 4chan has been flooding
my comments on YouTube, as early as 2011. I mean, they have been posting my reviews at a time,
about as often, as they posted Pitchfork reviews. It's almost like I do music reviews, and that's relevant to the discussion on the board, or something. This might not sound like a big point, but keep in mind:
the whole narrative of this article, is that ""I'm up here, pulling the strings, trying to figure out ways,
to get the alt-right to watch me. Hahahahaha!!"" So, the channel ended up getting hit kind of hard during the Ad-pocalypse. And it was getting worse, and worse, and worse. Which I've tweeted about, which I've mentioned in live streams, that the channel is nearly on its deathbed. And the ad revenue, that the channel was getting,
was never really that large to begin with. There's a point in the article, where the writer muses about me, having made $2000 off of two of the worst videos on the channel. Honestly - I was lucky, if I made $2000 off the channel in a month. Much less off of a couple videos. The article then goes on, to make a mention of the ""YouTube right"". YouTube becoming more extreme, conservative, and right-wing, mentioning guys like PewDiePie and Paul Joseph Watson. But the writer of this article throws me into that grouping as well, without even a mere mention of the fact, that I hate Paul Joseph Watson. And there's a video on my main channel, where I take him to task on that, that has more views, that nearly every video on thatistheplan. Somehow, that didn't make it into this ""incredibly well-researched"" piece of journalism. The article also brings up my avoidance
of using the ""n-word"" in my reviews. And yes, I don't use it for the reasons, stated in the video referenced in this article, and linked down there in the description. However, the writer takes my ""GREATEST RAPPER EVER"" series on thatistheplan, and tries to use that as proof, that... I have a secret agenda against hip-hop and black artists, and that I'm disingenious. He literally puts no detail about the J. Cole video
in this article, because it's not disturbing at all. And, the writer's inability to understand humour
is painfully clear, when he tries to explain the joke. ""The gag is simple: he pretends to rap in the style of these artists"". No! That is not the gag of the video! The gag of this series, is to make fun of over-eager fans. Who think a rapper is really profound and deep beyond compare, to the point, where they've ""achieved human perfetion"". To the point, where that fan will overlook flaws in that artist as a person. Which is why my character in the Hopsin video, takes all of his lyrics as gospel, puts too much stock in his anti-drugs stance. And treats his words like a dotrine or a mantra, that he repeats to the point where he goes insane, because of his obsession. Leading to a downward spiral of self-destruction. It has nothing to do with Hopsin's mental state, as the writer tries to claim. Hopsin's mental state isn't mentioned in this video once, neither overtly or subtly. And every one of my ""GREATEST RAPPER EVER"" videos,
is linked down below in the description box. I challenge viewers to look at them,
and see what's so heinous about them. And, in the video about XXXTentacion fans,
my joke referencing domestic violence was clearly at the expense of fans,
who refuse to believe the claims. The joke is that fan, refusing to let any new or gruesome information, sway his undying love for X. Like, that's so painfully clear. My stance of these issues has been painfully clear as well. Which, if *beep* done any research, he would probably caught videos, where I talked about the domestic violence allegations against XXXTentacion, or, even what recently happened with A$AP Bari. Who, I'm still kind of peeved, that he has not been ousted from the A$AP Mob. Those videos are linked below. Later in the article we get the smoking gun, saying ""Thatistheplan never released any parodies of white rock musicians"". Uh, again: it's kind of a moot point. Because it's not a parody of the rapper himself,
it's a parody of his over-eager fans. The writer fails to mention, that I have actually harshly critiqued and clowned on white artists and rock musicians in the past, on my main channel, where I do it without a lick of irony or satire, which, pretty much everyting on thatistheplan is shrouded in. Miley Cyrus, Corey Feldman... especially Corey Feldman. I did a ""NOT GOOD"" on Post Malone,
and uh... as well as Lil' Peep. The writer also tries to imply, that I have some kind of ridiculous connection to this ""Cult of Kek"" bullshit. Uh, because the word ""kek"" appeared in one of my meme videos. Because it's a bastardization of the word ""lol"". Which there have been many verisons of over the years, ""lel"" and ""lul"". But of course, there's nothing to that,
so all he can show is this screenshot. And then, we have me in front of yet another reaction image. And countless accounts, including tons of accounts on black Twitter, have used this as a reaction image. Yet the writer is acting, like I'm not referencing
meme culture on my meme channel. Like, I'm putting this picture up, because I have some kind of deep, twisted desire for violence to happen. A desire that's only apparent, when you read into satirical joke videos, on a surface level. The article comes back to the n-word, and insinuates,
that casually rattling it off, with no care in the world, is essentailly the equivalent of me
talking about memes, and genres of memes, that prominently feature that word in the meme itself. All of the article's examples of this, come by way of my ""deep fried memes"" video. Which, is the writer cared to watch the video, the most unironic part of all of it was my legitimate explanation of the origin of these memes. I mean, they're essentially memes inspired by, and memes that come from, black Twitter and Instagram. That have been filtered through one, two, three, four, too many filters, to the point, where they get really grainy,
really um, you know, kind of uh, brittle-looking. Often there's crude language in them,
often the n-word is in them. And, we're supposed to sit here and act, like this is
some sort of major, ideological disconnect for me. When in reality, I'm talking about a certain genre of memes, so those kinds of memes come up in the video. Just as feminist memes came up in my Trigglypuff video. And I rationalize that the same way I have to, when
I review an album, that has the n-word in the lyrics. Or when I have to have lyrics flash up in front of my face, to have the n-word in them. The writer pretty much admits in the article, 
hat he's too lazy to explain all of this. So he just says: ""Anthony thinks the n-word is fine.
That's all you need to know"". The writer really saved the best for last here, where he finally brings up, what he thinks are my ""ties"" to the alt-right. Keep in mind: the whole point of this article is to prove, that I'm alt-right. ""Alt-right"" is right in the title, but he couldn't mention this until the very end of the article; ot that he had so little evidence of this,
that it ends up here, at the finish. He tries this two ways. One, with me interviewing youtuber and political commentator, Sargon of Akkad, which I did back in 2015, shortly after the whole Gamergate thing kind of died out. Because I thought it was interesting,
that he as a figure rose out of this sudden, out-of-nowhere online movement, that a lot of places and publications were covering, up until this point. I don't see how I couldn't, in my own way. The article brings up Sargon's tasteless response to British Labour MP, Jess Phillips. As if that was the context of out conversation, when,
that wouldn't happen until deep into the following year. The writer even goes on to say, that Sargon himself has disawoved the alt-right, and has made multiple videos critiquing them. So, you're trying to tie me to the alt-right,
and your first attempt at doing that, is through a man, who has critiqued them, and torn them apart. And is routinely harrased by them, because he thinks, their hatred of Jewish people, their Nazi sympathies, and their white-centric identity politics are silly. And then the article claims, that my conversation
with Sargon, was like me ""doing market research"". On what - I don't know. The alt-right?
At this point the alt-right wasn't a thing. Next, the writer ties me to comedian and edgelord supreme, Sam Hyde, who I also interviewed on my podcast. And he tries to muddy context again, acting like
Sam's alt-right associations and fringe views were all well-established, by the time that we had a conversation. Which is NOT true. By the time Sam and I talked,
he hadn't even gotten his show on Adult Swim yet. Which ended up getting removed, because of all of that. I mean, by the time I talked to Sam, deeply left-wing publications like Buzzfeed have covered him too. Because of his, uh... TED Talk troll at Drexel University, the ""2070 paradigm shift"". Now, after this introduction of Sam into the article,
comes the grossest accusations in the entire piece. Yet also, the grossest inaccuracies. So, even though the language in this paragraph is very dark, I'm going to read the whole thing, and read it carefully. Because, this will most likely be the most important part of this video. Most important part of the video! »Hyde’s conversation with Fantano is horrific, offensive,
and enlightening as to where both men stand. Fair warning: he describes raping and murdering her. At one point, Hyde brings up Lena Dunham and describes in detail what he’d like to do to the actress. “I’ll take extra time, OK?” he says. “I’ll be nailing her, I’ll be punching her in the back of the neck, I’ll be boxing her eyes in. I’ll break [both] her orbital bones. I’m gonna destroy Lena Dunham so badly,
that the people that come to clean her up, they’re gonna be puking when they see what I did to her. I want them to know how I feel about her,
so I’m gonna fuck her up so bad, that they’re going to puke, when they see her bruised mangled body”.« So, basically the writes says that Sam, without warning, goes into a tyrade of threats, of physical violence and rape. And I'm on the other end laughing, I'm egging him on, and as the writer claims, ""I'm wishing I could do what he does"". When, there are actually three incredibly large mischaracterizations of this entire scenario. 1) For Sam this is a comedy bit, and he sets it up, essentially, by talking about Lena Dunham threatening him physically. The point of the joke being, that everything that he says afterwards is allegedly ""justified"", because... he felt threatened, physically. His life was in danger! 2) The writer brings rape up in this paragraph. And yet, through Sam's entire rant, as psychotic as it is - he doesn't bring rape, not one time. The entire podcast is linked down below,
the rant starts around the 25 minute mark. But yes, the article makes direct reference to RAPE, and yet, it is not HERE. And the thing is: Fader knows they messed up on this, because I'm reading the 1st and original version of the article. They've actually changed this paragraph, at least twice. There's another version, where they changed
the phrasing simply to ""rape and murder"", and then, in the 3rd and latest version, from my understanding, it just says ""violence toward a woman"". The three archive.es saves of this article, the original version, the second version and the latest version, (or at least, what is the latest version at the time of shooting this video), are saved down below, in the description box.
Check them out for yourself. And 3) My reaction, to what Sam is saying and doing,
is not al all, how the writer characterizes it. So, as Sam is ramping up this bit, that he thinks is funny, I'm sitting here, telling him, that ""a lot of people are gonna be listening to this podcast. Are you sure you wanna say this, eeehhh...?"" [Sam] Talking of retard, um... I mean, I've, I know- I've talked to her.
I know who she is, she's a dumb bitch. I'm sorry, okay? And if she ever fucks with me... [Antohny laughs nervously] If she ever puts me into a some sort of self-defense situation... [Anthony] Time-out, a lot of people gonna hear this podcast. [Sam] Yeah! [Anthony] So... okay, alright. [Sam] If she puts me in a self-defense situation, okay? And I have to legally defend myself, [A: uh-huh] okay?
I'm not gonna initiate violence against her. [A: okay.] He hears me, he responds, I'm trying to insert some logic into the situation, and he just keeps going. I try to throw yet another logical block in front of Sam, saying, that ""it isn't in Ms. Dunham's reputation,
to physically attack people, especially not him"". [Sam] But, if she comes at me, in an alleyway - tries to, y'know, take- tries to do anything, [Sam] I'm gonna be- I'm gonna-
[Anthony] I don't really know, if that's in her reputation. I was obviously questioning,
where he was going with this. What laughter did slip out, was clearly nervous. And bonus context: the writer fails to mention,
how painfully awkward a lot of this interview is. Not just because it was dificult to wrangle Sam,
and get him to focus on a single topic, but also, the ironic and thinly-veiled threats,
he would occasionally toss into the interview. - Do you own guns?
- No, I don't own any guns. - Do you have a license?
- No, I don't own a license. - You gonna get one?
- Uh, you're making me consider it... - You should.
- ...with your, with your creepy look. - Well, what if I was- what if- [stutters]
You got two guys in your house. And it's just, you... [chuckles]
What are you gonna do, to defend yourself? You gotta get a gun, man!
- Well... It's at this point, where the article just simply goes from cherry-picking and reframing information, to make me look like I'm racist; to literally, telling a series of bold-faced lies, to make it look, like I'm actively egging on some guy, publicly making rape threats on my podcast. I mean... is there a logical reason, as to why this should be SO factually inaccurate? Knowing this, beyond this point - how can anything else this guys says in this article, be trusted? But, I guess I gotta go through the rest of it anyway. The writer brings up the bleach video, from that
Amazing Atheist video, which... give me a break. The Amazing Atheist isn't even part of alt-right, he's not a white nationalist. Which is exactly what the movement has been since the beginning. So, we're almost through the entire article here. And the writer has brought up no concrete quotes or connections, that would paint me as catering to,
or aligning myself with, white supremacists. The article takes a tweet I made, pretty much on free speech principles, as some kind of signal that I'm right-wing. But somehow miss the countless other tweets,
where I'm espousing pretty left-wing ideals. And it's not like I don't genuinely state my political opinions in my reviews, and on my commentary channel, all the tiiiimee! ""Healthcare is a right, college should be free, legalize all drugs, end US imperialism, take power away from corporations, and fav 90's skramz bands?"" Um, I don't know, does like Pg. 99 count? I agree with everything that you said here, but the college thing... we're talking about public universities. And um, uh... yes, I fully agree with everything you said here. Poop poopson, thank you very much. The writer could've done some legitimate research here,
but instead, he's trying to paint me as being in bed with a racist political movement,
based off of memetic humor, and a guy, whose alt-right symphaties wouldn't surface,
until after his Adult Swim show aired? Okaaay. And while the channel has been controversial in the past,
nothing I've said has been any more edgy or out-there, than what you might catch on a new South Park episode,
or, I don't know, a Doug Stanhope stand-up special. Or another YouTube channel like Filthy Frank's, or iDubbbz. And you wouldn't frame them as being alt-right. Keep in mind, nearly all of these people
have made much harsher jokes, towards some of the same targets I have,
in my videos on my meme channel. Was I joking about SJWs? Oooh, yeah,
yeah I mean, I was, I'll admit that. But how does that mean, that I'm trying to create
audience overlap, with a guy like Richard Spencer? There's nothing inherently right-wing about
clowning rap fans, or memes, or edgy humour. Stapling yourself, ironically bullying other youtubers,
or whatever also I was doing on my other channel. And that sort of leaves me at the crossroads right now, because honestly, uh, I'm not really sure, what to do with this thatistheplan channel. I've been debating getting rid of it for weeks now,
because it's not making money on YouTube. YouTube has made it pretty clear,
that they're not interested in the content. And again: they're ridiculous, they're shitposts,
they're not very marketable and I understand that. So it's that, and it's also kinda the principle of the thing. Like, why should YouTube benefit off of this content, when I can't? Because, you know the site it using that content
to push people to related videos, that are monetized. I mean, I'm not happy about it, but I understand where YouTube is coming from. And I understand, there are outside forces at work here, influencing the site, to be as stringent as they are with advertisements. A lot like the outside forces,
making me uh, make this video! Tran- -sition! Did you this hitpiece a read?
If you did, what did you think of it? Uh, down in the description are multiple links,
to the videos that I mentioned in this article. Bunch of videos, that were originally up on thatistheplan:
meme reviews, the rapper series, all that stuff. Uh, just so you guys can see: whoa, am I trying to appeal to the alt-right with the content? You watch it, you'll see. And um... that's it, I'll see you guys in the next video. You're the best, thanks for watching.
Forever! "
datrlt_DGLs,hi everyone hold me breath Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new a glucose album neo wax bloom this is the latest full-length album from uk-based music closer mister igloo ghost who I first heard two years ago when he made his brain feeder Records debut at the Chinese New Year EP which was an incredible overwhelming mind-bending collection of tracks insane production that combined the rich jazzy and textured sound play of Flying Lotus with the kaleidoscopic electronic mayhem that typically comes out of the PC music camp and for a young producer he seems to have a deep appreciation for some of the older styles of electronic music to come out of his home country in the 90s like drum and bass and drill and bass and the detail in the tracks on this EP I mean it's incredible the rhythms are explosive the melodies and harmonies are layered beautifully it glues music is just maximal to the max and as puzzling and colorful as a 10 by 10 Rubik's Cube and on top of that he conceptualizes his music is like being the soundtrack to a jelly squiggly worm wearing a witch's hat going through different dimensions or something at least that's what I remember him saying in a podcast I did with him now after just hearing a handful of tracks on this EP I was convinced that igloo ghosts could become one of the most enigmatic and creative producers out there and I'm happy to see that that prediction pretty much came true with the material that he delivers here on his new record now he teased toward this album with quite a few singles the song peanut choker landed on his little grids EP last year and again it's also featured here we also had the tracks white gum and bug thief and solar blade and these songs are multicolored they're frantic they're really intense but the more I listened to them the more it seemed like there was a very coherent method to igloo ghosts madness and it may not seem like it on the surface the constantly bustling and shuffling and tangled rhythms at first they kind of sound the way that a really difficult and long-winded trigonometry equation on a blackboard looks but like candy there's something really sweet about what igloo does with his music it's really invigorating and it just kind of keeps beckoning me back to decipher it like I'm I don't know mapping out a human genome or figuring out the equation for time travel and while these tracks are dense there are musical and sonic components and themes that shine out in every song like on super ink burst which features these rich and wailing saxophone leads the sound is so raw it's so live it's mixed so perfectly the way the sax kind of intertwines with the very intense rhythms it almost reminds me of like some old-school very aggressively performed bebop jazz or the delicate and beautiful chord progressions on the song bug thief that eventually give way to some glistening and dancing synth leads the plucky sour patch flavoured guitars on the song Zen champ really pop out to my ears as well as the very speedy and chugging rhythms here it kind of reminds me of like a steam engine going at light speed and they're a good handful of cuts on here the feature this very fast chipmunk trapping so fast you can't really decipher a lot of what's being said it's really just kind of another sound to be added into the insanity solar blade and white gum being my two favorite examples of this the the latter of those two kind of feels like a grime song thrown in a hyperdrive and as long as we're talking about rapping it's nice to hear igloo ghosts continuing to collaborate with mr. yo T who appears on the second half of the track teal Yomi slash olivine now while these songs do throw a lot at you structurally speaking there are some peaks and valleys there are well-crafted intros and outros the musical and rhythmic progressions do become clear with each listen it's not like igloo ghost is simply just beating listeners over the head with a merciless barrage and moments in the tracklisting like purity shards kind of served as a nice short little interlude type breather amongst all of these varies a knee bangers as does the song infinite mint featuring Koosh who I wish some a little bit more boldly on the track her vocals do tend to get sort of drowned out by the very vibrant instrumentation through much of the song though I do in theory enjoy her breathy singing approach here and there's something about her singing style and igloos production on this track that just reads to me as having a giant Bjork influence like it would be amazing to hear those two linked up at some point and I'm not sure what else to say I mean it's a pretty solid listen it's tight forty minutes and there are tons of quality tracks here I think it is a very formidable full-length debut for brain feeder records but as a new and an emerging artist I still think there's room for improvement this thing is inventive it's sharp its idiosyncratic its unique its bold and I still think igloo ghost is on track to become a one-of-a-kind artist I think the record could have had a little bit more attention paid to flow could have had a bit more attention paid to stylistic diversity the constantly jittery vibe of these instrumentals does reach a formulaic peak toward the end of the record it's a bit front-loaded as well and cuts like peanut choker do not sound quite as cutting edge and as refreshing and as big time as a lot of the more recently released material on this thing the subtler moments here were 100% necessary but did not feel quite as essential as the more aggressive highs I guess it's maybe more of a blind spot for igloo at this point like finding ways to craft tracks that are just as captivating as solar blade but while executing a bit of restraint overall really impressed with this album scratched pretty much all of the itches I expected it to and looking forward to what a goo ghost is doing in the future for sure I'm feeling a light eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what's your are you next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't die just you know drink your water your fruits and veggies all that stuff get a good night's sleep and over here next to my head is a review for the ghost EP that I reviewed before this or you can click on the link to subscribe to the channel I'll see you guys in the next one forever 
uOJW7JwgA6Q,ah hi everyone can I hear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our great albums installment where I go over the records from this past month that I really enjoyed make sure they're not slipping through the cracks for you guys re recommend them and link all the reviews to them down in the description box so you guys check them out you know just in case something passed by you and you didn't see me telling you hey listen to this because I think that's really good alright let's kick it off with the new young thug and DJ carnage EP this is bangers bangers bangers bangers some of young thugs best and most crazy and off-the-wall vocal performances yet on this thing it's only a handful of tracks but the tracks are quality and very fun and very entertaining doesn't really last long enough for you to get sick of it and pretty much every song is super potent and super to the point so I'm really enjoying this set of tracks and hoping that carnage and young thug hook up more in the future because I thought the material they came together with here was really great moving on from their Rhapsody's new album LYLAS wisdom this is a classy thoughtful personal moving and very topical jazz rap album obviously a lot of inspiration coming from Kendrick Lamar on this record but Rhapsody really kind of turns that inspiration into her own thing and comes through with her boldest and most ambitious album yet she is a lyricist lyricist and MCS emcee a real hardcore hip-hop heads a real hardcore hip-hop head person artist so you know what I'm thinking there and there's just a lot of quality tracks on this thing I mean a few moments that are a little bland a little underwhelming because I think she's still kind of working on getting that conviction you know to really pour through in her vocal performances but here more than ever and I've been following her stuff for a while she really wowed me should really impress me she really left a mark and an impact on me next the new open mike eagle album brick body kids still daydream this is a very personal and a very conceptual album from mr. Mike Eagle where he essentially goes back to his roots goes back to his past first to his old stomping grounds and how essentially they've been demolished the projects that I used to live in as a kid back in Chicago and just kind of reflects on that while also attacking like a lot of modern contemporary politics racism societal inequality in the modern day of course he you know attacks all this stuff with a series of very smart versus great production very mellow very pretty very moody some quality hooks on this thing to some good features as well um not really sure what else to say beyond I think it's one of his most ambitious and tightest projects yet because I think he you know sort of carries out the subject matter and the the concept of the album really well and very nicely Ariel Pink's new album dedicated to Bobby Jameson I thought was really good really solid really consistent it's a bit of a stylistic throwback to some of the stuff that he created in the early years you know if you loved his older material like worn copy and you know house arrest and you know scared famous and and that sort of thing like you're gonna like this material you know it's not reinventing the wheel or doing anything entirely new over here but his quirky approach to production is very tongue-in-cheek and silly and instantly catchy songwriting are all intact and all performed very well over here next the new Alex Cameron album forced witness Alex Cameron Australian singer-songwriter comes through with a set of tracks that are bold hilarious full of character very funny very entertaining he kind of nails these songs with a soft rock with an Americano with a Heartland rock a synth pop aesthetic he kind of mixes all of those worlds together in a really interesting way but truly it is the lyrics that really sell this album like each track kind of has a story behind it that paints Alex Cameron as a bit of a character that he's playing on this record who's a kind of a lovable scumbag who spends a lot of his time trying to get laid on the internet it's it's a really funny record it's a fun record the songwriting and the hooks are incredible and just so infectious on this thing I just can't say no to the sound easily one of my favorite records of the year the new all Vaes album anti socialites is one of the best dream pop and sort of twee pop records that I've heard in a while the vocals are pretty bold the songwriting is really strong the production is really clear and sweet on the ears easily the best record that the band has put out so far and hopefully we have more records of this caliber to come from these guys I've got to give a shout out to death from above formerly death from above 1979 their new record outrage is now is the rockin and I guess just a really quality record that I hope that their comeback album was took them a little bit to kind of get to the point where they are now but kind of the gutsiness is back but it's being executed with almost like a bit of a 80s hardrock rock sort of flair some of the lyrics on this thing are pretty interesting occasionally the band gets a little socially aware a little political but you know for the most part this stuff is straightforward it's to the point it's gutsy its energetic and they do a really good job of kind of sticking to that bass vocal and drum dynamic and use that to deliver some very heavy and entertaining songs and finally the new o'seas album orc like fantastic garage psych punk blend of course it kind of feels like they're building on a lot of the great production the jammy performances and the excellent musicianship and fantastic fundamentals that they brought forth on their last record and you know it's kind of really taken it above and beyond on this new album over here with a series of tracks that are fun throttling experimental and just really great instrumental chemistry between all the musicians on this thing and that is how I'm gonna leave it guys those are all the records that I thought were fantastic and I needed to recommend to you guys re recommend to you guys reira mind you that I thought all of those records were very good of course they're all sitting in the love list right now and you know that's it that's it all linked down there in the description thank you for watching hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this

Uxmi5AcAFgg,hi everyone mr kanye west's here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new smoke purp mixtape dead star smoke purp is a Florida rapper who is a part of this new wave of grimy aggressive soundcloud rappers with overblown trap production some of which are very dark they deliver flows that are usually pretty simplistic and hypnotic lyrics that are kind of minimal little pump is an example I know perp has some deep ties with him and pump is featured on this tape xxx 10 Tasi own ski mask the slump god Wi-Fi funeral I guess you could also connect guys like trippy red and Famous decks to this new wave and there are many more you could literally list them forever but I need to talk about this tape now perp like a lot of these guys he's mostly a singles based artist I mean he dropped one project last year that was just six tracks but over the past couple of years he's dropped a whole mess of standalone songs that are now floating around YouTube and SoundCloud and most of the singles he's dropped this year ended up on this tape howdy okay bless your trap different colored Molly to the moon streets love me so this project isn't isn't huge on the element of surprise but it does compile and accurately portray perp in his current artistic state and also inadvertently acts as a de facto mission statement for this new style of internet rap because little pumps mixtape isn't out yet and on his new album xxx tenth Accio and decided to go emo folk and ski mask he's he's a little too out there he's kind of in his own lane he's really idiosyncratic he's sort of in line and enjoyed by a lot of people who follow this up-and-coming style but he's doing his own thing now purp he perfectly embodies on this tape what exactly makes this style so fun so entertaining but simultaneously he also embodies just about every cliche this sound has to offer the fat distorted bass the overuse of ad-libs the opening chorus on the song okay is literally just him repeating the word okay okay okay some songs barely even have choruses some songs are hilariously short the flow on the song outie is basically same flow that X uses on look at me the auto-tune singing on our AP Max is absolute trash and probably the lowest point on the entire album of course next to the song purgatory which really lives up to its title as being like a place that I really want to escape from it's just like a badly sung cloudy bunch of nothing but you know what a lot of this tape is really fun and grimy and wild it's so intoxicatingly stupid when the best parts of this tape are on I just want to go full on the and earth all there are so many nasty Savage highlights on this thing the song I don't know you that kicks the entire thing off has this grinding bass eerie swirling lead melody is that the kind of cycle and a really odd repetitive way it sounds like something out of a horror movie I don't know you know me bitch pretty much every line in this guy's rhymes ends with the word bitch and while that's not the only thing he's rhyming there's just something really odd about his flow like it's got a super hypnotic quality to it at first I thought it was really stupid but then it really started like wearing me down and just locking in my head and I just couldn't get away from it just that little emphasis on the last beat the bitch it just hits this really primal sweet spot that just locks me into the groove and it's kind of crazy of course yo gotti and Chief Keef are featured on this track both of them deliver a pretty slick features although given yo Gotti's current situation with Dolph I'm not sure I care too much for that vegetarian with the beef line and some of the lyrics on this thing are just cold-blooded they're just deadly little purp rapping about taking a soul puttin dudes on shirts robbing people sending out shots there's nothing nice about this mixtape when you put this tape on put put the kids to bed the song okay I mean as dumb as some of this song is the energy radiating off of it is just radioactive purp and pump kind of go ballistic on this thing they have some incredible chemistry of course the song features rumbling bass really dreary pianos and what sounds like freaking crows crows sampled in the beat like a crow the triplet flows on this thing are super tight and it just makes me kind of want to go dumb although the song streets love me in a way this track is of poignant and portrays perp as this dude who is knowingly going against his better interest not listening to his mother actively going out and getting in trouble just like his father the synth lines all over this track are freaky and creepy they're kind of glitchy I feel like I'm listening to a broken keyboard or something and there's a Juicy J feature of all things on this track and it goes over really great a track that's a little bit more self-aware and seems a bit more like a comment is the song no safety another track that sounds freakish dark like straight out of a trap flavored horror film except the monster is is purp and this is yet another song where he is essentially rapping about his life as a ruthless drugged up gangster but rapping about how in his surroundings there is no safe deep no safe deep no safety of course we have other cuts on here they're just banging they're aggressive they're in your face they're just invigorating like blehh Co trap meanwhile tracks like Krispy Kreme are just as catchy but play it super super slick like the flow on the course of this thing is so nice even though it is a little bit it is a little bit of a playboy cardi Magnolia ripoff that's one thing though purple like a lot of his SoundCloud contemporaries kind of where's his influence is very boldly on his sleeve to the point where it can get kind of distracting now even though in a lot of respects this tape is kind of a compilation it does seem like perp took special care to sequence these songs in a way where you have different vibes at different points on the project like as we get toward the tail end of this thing there are so many more tracks that are more low-key more ballad like feature more auto-tune and are a little trickier to like on to the moon which I love the druggie just psychedelic vibe of this track though the slurring words on the chorus the surreal edits and sound effects like this track is deeply druggie and is one of the few songs that I guess you could say is in this cloud trap style that legitimately feels like it's it's really a mind altering the song count up featuring DRAM is another auto-tuned highlight dream singing toward the end of the track adds a lot to the cut but while there are songs on this thing that I like overall it's a really inconsistent tape though I do appreciate that it's just about 44 minutes long there were some underdeveloped cracks in the tracklisting here that I thought had more potential like the song topic which had some of the more weirdly trippy vocal edits on the entire project that I wish I could have heard more of like there's so many songs on this thing that either could have been cut or just added on to and it would have improved the whole thing so much more overall this thing is decent there's a captivating energy and aggression to it yet there are also spots that are super alluring purpose definitely putting some of his best material forward like the best moments on this thing just make me want to shut my brain off and just plug into this pure sense of I don't give a fuck however is it lyrically interesting only rarely only on occasion would perp say something so grimy I would have to take a step back or clever or just nasty I'm feeling a strong six on this thing there are more tracks on here that I like then I don't but they're just too many tracks on here that are totally forgettable or just so bad they're unforgettable that you know I I just can't ignore that transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're angry okay I'll see you guys in the next one over here next to my head is a ski mask the slump god review click on that hit that up and you can do that or you can click on the link to subscribe to the channel alright love you forever 
lI6-C7dwz9k,hi everyone besties teeth Tanner here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new injury reserved IP drive it like it's stolen this is the latest project from california via arizona hip hop trio injury reserve the gang's all here grazie richie parker who dropped their debut full-length album at the very end of last year floss some of their best material some of their biggest singles yet we're on that record like oh and all this money they're a group that has like this jazz rap finesse but also that modern contemporary trap rap boom you know that new-school energy but that old-school wit now the trio could have easily taken the year off concentrated on a record or another mixtape but they decided to hit fans early with a new seven-track EP and it's a decent collection of songs with a potently moody and dark aesthetic to it that fits very well with the cover this is a more low-key and somewhat more stripped back version of injury reserve and that's for better or for worse because while i do think this new approach brings out some different dynamics in the group and challenges them on more of a lyrical level there were some cuts on this thing that i thought were a little underwhelming like the opening cut ten tenths which has a very glitchy off-kilter skeletal be Richie and grogs vocally are playing it almost as monotone as possible the latter of the two sort of has a bit of a weird robot effect on his voice around 140 the song kind of ends and the beat just sort of carries it out until this track truly finishes and while there were some interesting ideas here both lyrically and instrumentally the song itself is just too too scant and doesn't really explore its full potential to get beyond the initial awkwardness that I think the song introduces by being so much of a left hook and the song 91 Cadillac DeVille while there are some bars on here that I think are pretty quotable it is a very chill laid-back piece of jazz rap that doesn't have too much bite to it sonically and while I'm complaining I will say that the closer I love the personal angle of the lyrics on this thing it's really inspiring it's really uplifting Richie and grogs essentially going out there making a success of themselves with their music and pushing their fans to chase their dreams as well but how can a song this personal this emotionally moving not have a stronger ending to it even if it is being tabbed as merely an outro outside of that there are some fantastic highlights on this record that again are not quite as aggressive as we've known injury reserve to be in the past not quite as funky or vibrant and colorful but there is a really essential and a very well-crafted darkness to these tracks that I like a lot like on the song boom times 3 which has this very murky bass some atmospheric tones some Dorjee piano that occasionally has this effect on it where it feels like it's falling in and out of focus it's kind of disorienting Richie is on the hook here yelling all over the track like a junkyard dog when he's rapping and when grogs is rapping the voices seem a little bit deeper like they've been pitched a bit kind of in a somewhat surreal and devilish way the song is monstrous but I wouldn't call it a banger there's something kind of reserved about it like it's aggressive and it's mean but it's it's more of kind of a cerebral anger and aggression and again talking about the increase and the improvement in the the trio's lyricism I love the line on here that garage drops about you know is it a scene if it's not heard or seen like the the Riu Sajjad in different contexts and the different meanings was really clever Ricci drops this funny series of bars where he's talking about ghost riding in rap talking about since the days of NWA and probably even before there there has been ghost writing in rap like why is this like such a hotly debated topic the song north pole is easily one of the most heartbreaking tracks the trio has released Ritchie making references to a dead friend who he misses making references to his father who passed away Grogg has this really sharp set of lines where he's talking about GPS then shifting to his kid being taken away by Child Protective Services CPS and then beyond there he references this Jay Z line about the CBS logo having one eye open and saying that he likes that line and since he likes that he can CBS the instrumental is very simple but features these incredibly somber and jazzy guitar chords and some weird ghostly robot vocals that I think are fantastic see you sweat is another track that is irresistible funky totally a party single but sort of takes that Neptunes ferrell approach to production we're like the grooves are great the sound is colorful but it's not too hard it's kind of a very subtle it's like such a party song but yet it's also very low-key and I love that the duo can sort of find this amazing balance between going hard but also going easy like it's so slick Gragas and Richy bring these excellently smooth and very catchy flows all over the track and the song colors is another very introspective and thoughtful track that attacks societal racism and racial inequality and ties it in very well and creatively with a color based theme also that astroturf line that Ritchie dropped on this thing was again another moment where it just hits me that they're really stepping up lyrically on this thing and I would love to see that improve more into the future of course I wouldn't say it's the best EP that I heard all year nor would I say that it's it's a perfect release but honestly for me a lot wasn't really hinging on this release it's just an EP I'm not really looking at this thing and like trying to decide and expect where the group is going next for me this is kind of like another helping of music from a rap crew that I really enjoy and anybody who's been a fan of their stuff up until this point like please do not miss this this is not just simply a fan project some of their legitimately best material is on this thing it's just so there are a few tracks I thought were a little underwhelming and given that it's only 7 songs a few tracks that I think are just OK ends up being a lot I'm feeling a strong 7 on this thing tritter to transition have you given this album a listen oh wait it's an EP well did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which would I review next hit the light if you like please subscribe and please don't die stay hydrated and your fruits and veggies goddammit over here next to my head is another injury or reserve review you can click on that or click on the link to subscribe to the channel that would be nice I'll see you guys on the next one you're the best rabbit 
t3Vdww9zlWY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and this is the monthly y-you know review segment where I go over a series of records that I didn't get a chance to do a long-form formal review of over the past month so I am talking about them in brief gauntlet style here all of the album's I am talking about in this video are listed down there in the description box and without any further ado the y-you know review why isn't this album out in the US why isn't this album out in the u.s. why isn't this album out in the US one of the worst things I've ever heard me just say anything else is he laughing is he laughing at how not good this sounds this sounds like auto-tune drunken karaoke I mean generally the vocals all over the album er are pretty awful instrumentals kind of uninspired I I do not I don't I don't get this wood is pretty fun I will never listen to this again okay and my fan of this thing not really however I will say this is the first release I've heard from AV where he kind of sidesteps this criticism that I've had for his work in the past where his stuff just kind of sounds like an animal collective album sans the other members of Animal Collective this is the first release where he's really just like stepping beyond expectations and coming together with a really strange freaky an experimental folk album that is totally out there and I admire the bold and very strange risks he takes on this record I feel like it's a little too whacked out and indulgent for me to really get into like it's it's about as strange just like a Coco Rosie album at some points maybe not quite as strange but it's it's certainly bordering on that and for people who are into that more challenging side of the abstract full spectrum then please do not let this album slip by you because there are some people who may be in that camp because that's not typically what Animal Collective is known for at least not in these days a lot of their older stuff was freakier and funkier but definitely give this AV album a shot if anything I've described here sort of tickles your fancy because he's definitely doing something bold here does it really mean or anything or speak to me significantly not really but still this thing was definitely a surprise I mean I'm more interested in the new Juicy J album than I am this mixtape and to be honest it does kind of get old after a while it's super depraved and it's very dumbed down and there are some terrible features on this thing but when this tape is good it's fucking amazing and man the the suicide Boys production on this thing is awesome so if you're looking for just a druggie crazy totally off-the-wall just like just I don't give a fuck if I OD trap mixtape then then please give this a listen now this is the cormorant that I enjoyed hearing back when they dropped their dwellings record so many years ago I mean if you're unfamiliar with these guys they are a powerfully progressive metal outfit that fuses into their sound elements of some black metal some death metal like it's it's a lot of different styles and influences but they they blend it together pretty nicely pretty seamlessly into these really powerful epic heavy songs on one of their previous records earth driver I thought the production was a little rough around the edges kind of made the record feel so much more underwhelming than I wanted it to be but it seems like they're going back into a much more epic direction with a slightly better sound on this new album over here I'm not gonna say that it's a them you know breaking new ground for their sound or anything like that but if you've loved everything the band is done up until this point you will most likely enjoy this and if you are a progressive metal fan who's looking for a band that does a DIY a band that's underground doing their own thing marching to the beat of their own drum you got to give this thing a shot you've got to listen to this record for the love of friggin God if if this band wasn't speaking to me already in the late 2000s that's it's not gonna start now I don't know this is just kind of one of those late era albums from a band where a lot of those original fundamental characteristics that made a group great are still kind of there but there's just that extra something that is just kind of missing you know certainly the duo was not as eccentric and as inventive and as over-the-top or really as fun as they used to be but you know it's still pretty good time I was so excited and hyped for this dude when I heard some of the you know preliminary tracks and snippets leading up to this album because the music sound a really beautiful centered really pretty and it's kind of interesting to hear an artist who brings together elements of R&B and soul but clearly like he loves himself some Radiohead like he loves some Dirty Projectors too like you could hear those tonalities in his court progressions in his vocalizations it's like the perfect cross way between the worlds of R&B and indie and I don't know once I actually was able to see the full view of these songs I feel like some of the tracks on this thing are more bells and whistles and more just pretty sounds and they are just like compelling and fully realized songs like there are a few tracks on here certainly that are structured very well written very well quarrel probably being the best of all of them but there are just too many tracks on here that feel almost as if they're just a random array of like really pretty vocalizations and instrumental flourishes that don't really add up into a memorable tune however you know with songs like quarrel under Moses Bell no reason that he can't write more mature songs moving forward and who knows under what circumstances this album came out maybe it was rushed a little bit to get the whole thing together and it is just a very short and straightforward 35 minutes maybe something a little more hefty and a little more ambitious and a little more fully realized is down the pipe and once that happens I think Moses will have the total package because he has some great influences great ideas very strong pretty sound and hopefully in the future some really fantastic songs to back it up from front to back on a record while I'm not in love with this Deerhoof album it is one of the more unique albums in the band's discography for a few different reasons for one it brings on a number different musical guests including Montana Roberts and latisha seder of Sarah lab FAMAS any Ruby knows and that's just kind of the tip of the iceberg aquafina is well a guest rapper and I mean it does bring a lot of personality it does bring a lot of fun to the record certainly these guests enhance a lot of the tracks also this record is a political statement from Deerhoof as it were believe it or not and some of the tracks that do have a more political theme like some of the covers on here or the song about surviving in in spite of the people in power who hate you are actually incredible moments on the album some of my favorite tracks on the entire thing but also it's easily one of the Bands most intelligent records to where you have multiple tracks here on a pretty short album it's 39 minutes it's not one of the longest in their catalog that kind of indulge in these really weird instrumental detours some tracks they're just a little too repetitive one track that takes on like almost like an opera approach which these weird and totally like unpredictable moments on the album in my opinion at least kind of muddy the political message that the band is trying to send on this album also I think it kind of takes away from the moments where you have guest artists on here that kind of help the band create high points in the tracklisting here you know it's just that there's a good record in here but there are a lot of weird detours and bells and whistles and diamonds in the rough kind of just tossed and then the tracklist and really haphazardly and I'm not exactly sure what the band felt these moments we're adding to the album because in my opinion many of them just sort of take away but you know some of their best material is on this thing it's it's just kind of surrounded by some stuff that's a little distracting I guess I want to like this guy's music so much more than I do and it's mostly because he has such an interesting cross-section of influences like southern hip hop and trap and just like really dark three 6 mafia type shit but then he fuses that with like death metal and punk and industrial and it's super dark it's super distorted it's super ugly it's super edgy it's really nasty I mean there are even some moments where he it kind of reminds me of ICP but not even necessarily in a bad way but so many of the tracks on here are and obviously there's a huge bones influence on this thing to so many of the tracks on this thing just feel kind of like these I don't know aimless messes that didn't really want to build into anything all that cohesive or fully fleshed out like some of these tracks are like weird detours or something it's it's just kind of a tad inconsistent as a project but damn if this dude doesn't have an incredible amount of potential with the sounds and ideas that he's pulling together I've enjoyed her beau's music ever since he started making noise with his phase ole and mixtape under the name little herb and while he's had a few lackluster mixtapes released since then I was kind of waiting for him to drop that one big commercial project that would kind of send him to the top that would define his sound to find his style and this just did not really deliver in my opinion I mean there are a handful of tracks on here that go really hard are thoughtful lyrically like as far as these rappers that come from that drill and trap institution herb usually has like some pretty great and quality lyrics that kind of get to the root of the the the background that he comes from you know from a kind of societal or a social standpoint but on this new record over here not that I think it's all that lackluster lyrically though there are some tracks or it feels like you really kind of dumbs it down to reach a wider audience the issues that some people have had in the past with his flow which can kind of be offbeat it's so off on this album on some tracts that it's it's like it's almost like he's parodying himself or something I am not really sure what to say you know it's not entirely terrible but it's spotty its spotty and it's just not the massive you know kerplunk splash debut that I was hoping for you know what I mean shout out to the pains of being pure heart on this record this record is kind of a bounce back from their last album which in my opinion was sort of underwhelming this new one over here it may not be the sound that the indie heads that love them years ago may be familiar with and it may not be the most original sound on the planet either but it is very quality pop rock and synth pop album with some very good hooks and some kind of rousing performances so I mean it's a decent record the Crown Prince of Prague is back with a an album that is so inoffensive you could play it in a doctor's office I mean I'm glad that Stephen Wilson has kind of given up on merely trying to just trace over the progressive rock blueprint on this new album but I mean it's not like what he's given us in exchange here is all that exciting by comparison I don't know I mean there are a few spots where maybe his songs are a bit hooky ER or you know some of the piano that appears on this record is very beautiful but um I still don't find him captivating as a songwriter as a singer and the instrumentals in my opinion leave a lot to be desired in the excitement department it's it's just not for me and everything that I have you know not enjoyed about Wilson's music in the past just continues to be confirmed again and again and again with every new release so Primus er back original lineup on this album I was most likely just excited to hear that as you were but while it sounds like a 90's Primus record yeah it just sounds like a 90's Primus record but with no interesting songs and really boring performances like if Prime it sounded like this in the mid-90s they never would have blew up and considering that I mean I'm not really sure what else to say it's just so painfully underwhelming it's it's so drab it's D saturated this was a pretty interesting EP for Mastodon like I'm not gonna say I loved it but it certainly wasn't as hard to swallow and as annoying as their last album it's kind of jumpy they indulge in a lot of different rock and metal styles on this thing in a somewhat disjointed way but I feel like that's kind of the intent and the point of the EP for these songs to be multifaceted and sort of have multiple personalities going on at once they were certainly well strung together and pretty well performed I'm not sure I really like hearing Mastodon play at this smooth on some of these tracks but certainly came together pretty well and I guess I would enjoy hearing the band go in this direction more than I would hear them like to continue what they were doing on their new album so I don't know

B5lZ7M3Qkdk,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and I shaved my mustache I got sick of it which is good because if I got sick of my mustache in the time period that I did maybe YouTube is close to getting sick of de monetizing videos that would be wonderful let's do it weekly track roundup where I go over the best and worst tracks of the week in my opinion my humble opinion of course before we get into that I have to shout out that I am going on tour this October speaking engagement tour linked to tickets is down there in the description along with our amazon associates link if you click on that link it takes you to the front page of Amazon if you live in the US anything you buy on Amazon after you've clicked on that link we get kicked back from it does not add to your overall price it supports the channel supports the channel supports this segment and we have a similar thing going on with the good people over at turntable lab where you can buy colorful pressings of Records that I have reviewed on the channel or some turntable stuff some speaker stuff you know audiophile gear for your budding record collector and that's it let's get into the worst track so it's not even a BS this this is this is we're really blazing already into this why you know review and we're just a minute in and we're already past all the plugs but you know I I know I went easy on you guys I did that quick but because I did please please do hit up those links thank you alright let's start with the worst track of the week as we as we typically do and unfortunately I have to shout out the new William Patrick Corrigan tracks or track rather you know him as Billy Corrigan of the band Smashing Pumpkins he's been coming out with a bunch of solo material lately under the name WPC or William Patrick Corrigan and my god his solo music lately has just been super dramatic and I don't know just full of hot air and really fluffy and just just it seems like over performed and over produced for such a half-baked song such an uninteresting song such an uninteresting acoustic track I'm really not sure what to make of this track or really this forthcoming album everything I've heard so far has been incredibly underwhelming and it's it's not looking too good for the new WPC record in my opinion nor am i that hot on the new partynextdoor single featuring house ii which of course goes in another dancehall direction and Halsey over this type of production sounds incredibly incredibly awkward like more awkward than she usually does on her own stuff again I don't know if this is her being alternative here but it's it's it's certainly underwhelming and really bland and again kind of towing this cliched line for this style of music that is but is seeing a real mainstream resurgence right now such a fashion where it's you know appealing to very Western audiences alright and unfortunately I was not really that into the new Laura Jane grace cover of the mountain goats best-ever death metal band in Denton which is one of my favorite Mountain Goats covers or rather tracks of all time and this track is going to be featured on a forthcoming album where it's just nothing but other artists covering the mountain goes so I'm kind of excited to hear what artists are on here what songs they're going to cover I know there is a tracklist so you can already see what songs are gonna be on it but I don't know what artists are gonna be covering what and so I'm kind of excited for the reveal for the final reveal but in my opinion it's not really off to a good start I mean it is an acoustic version I just really feel like Laura sort of over does it with her vocal delivery a little bit is is just a little bit too a Thorat ativ and not all that I guess kind of earnest and doesn't give the story much of a sympathetic edge in my opinion which you know is the part of the beauty of John's original performance of this track but it underwhelmed me but maybe not maybe not you guys maybe not other Mountain Goats fans out there and shout out to the new l7 track this is like the first track the band has released in years and much like what the band leti gray did when they released that anti-donald trump pro-hillary song when the campaign trail was blazing l7 have come out of retirement to release an anti Donald Trump song it's titled a dispatch from mar-a-lago and it is like this really stomach-churning rock music like with a w that's how much it fuckin rocks it's it's just like I don't know punky bar band rock with like pretty much every guitar riff cliche in the book and and the fact that it's trying to ram a political message down your throat stated in a you know really ham-fisted way just kind of makes it a little gross and uninteresting and feeling like they're just trying to pander to the fact that I don't like Donald Trump and I hate being pandered to alright but those are the tracks that I thought were the worst this week let's move on to the songs that I wasn't crazy about but I certainly thought were worth highlighting worth shouting out for one the band wild beasts to have a track out titled punk drunk and trembling this song to me is a funkier and Cynthia and much more vibrant an interesting take on the sort of 80 sounds that the band was dabbling in on their last record boy King which underwhelmed me and I kind of dipped on unfortunately but another sort of sad thing about the release of the single is that has come with the announcement that the band are actually going to be breaking up and doing a farewell tour so do look up those dates do look up you know those final moments that you're gonna be able to catch this band live because they are a good band and if you ever enjoyed their music over the years you're probably not gonna want to miss that so check out the single look out for the band coming to a city near you hopefully and you know good times you know our ap wild beasts moving on from there the world is a beautiful place and I am no longer afraid to die have a new track out which is from their new album on epitaph records it's out now and it's it's alright you know it's not my favorite track from the this new album cycle so far but I'm not gonna say too much about it beyond that because I am going to review the album very soon I'm hoping to it's titled 2 gram give it a shot and hopefully it appeals to you a little bit more than it did to me next is the new rich the kid track featuring Kendrick Lamar and this over here has ASAP ferg a made in Tokyo on here but this is actually the version that features Kendrick Lamar that's sort of going around the internet and getting really hot right now and the track is OK I mean rich the kid has one of the most cliched flows out there in trap at the moment Kendrick is really you know crazy and off the wall and really eccentric and really colorful but not really doing anything vocally that he hadn't already dabbled in on his new album damn so it's not really a track that is interesting to me outside of the fact that the production is pretty good it's a banger the energy is up there but it's it's pretty much a throwaway single like it's the we're nobody's in to care about this track next year it's a pretty average track in my opinion and Michael Cera has a new single out yes Michael Cera of all people has dropped a new single you may remember that Bandcamp album you put out a while back but this new single over here actually features Sharon Van Etten who actually delivers a very nice vocal performance over much of the song it still kind of has that quaint indie low-five vibe to it but the synth sound much nicer and they're actually some nice like string embellishments on this thing too so um you know while it does kind of have that loafie aesthetic it's very well composed and put together like it's it's better assembled songwriting wise than much of Michael's band camp album from a while back so you know maybe if Michael keeps at it he could drop more quality you know singles like this it's not mind-blowing or anything like that but it's certainly you know in better taste and more well-put-together than a you know a lot of that previous band camp album material and finally shout out to first aid kit who are trying something kind of new on this latest single the track is titled I believe it's a shame and the I don't know mean it's got like a bit of an Americana vibe - and I know Western folk music has always been an influence for the twin based duo but um I don't know it's it seems they're taking turns singing a little bit more not trying to sing on top of one another as much which kind of gives you know each individual sister you know a little bit more you know shine a little bit more light and you know it's kind of a nice change of pace you know I think the instrumental is a little run-of-the-mill for this style of music not all that much teeth on it but it is very pleasant tune and it is pretty well performed and you know of course the vocals are always the selling point for first aid kit and those you know are good and let's move on to the tracks that I thought were the best this week first I got a shout out the the new West Side doom track featuring West Side gun and MF doom they have put out a collaborative single it's titled Gorilla Monsoon and I have heard from online sources that they have recorded two tracks together and you know West Side gun is essentially hyping that they are going to be putting out an album at some point and I don't know I mean I hope that ends up happening I don't know what doom has said to him I don't know dooms schedule I don't know what dooms obligations are right now I mean obviously that Adult Swim missing notebook rhyme series fell through so you know at this point I don't really sort of hold my breath when it comes to doom like oh he's gonna do it he's gonna do it you know no question he's definitely gonna do it he's not gonna bail on this you know he could end up bailing on this and if he did it would actually be really disheartening because I think this single is really good like the instrumental is fantastic it's eerie West Side gun is sounding sharper here than he has on any track I've heard him before you know I've heard some of his previous material and it wasn't really blown away this really kind of left its mark on me especially with him kind of kicking the track off like very high energy high level of intensity to his flow on this thing and doom comes through with like this super minimal super laid-back delivery that's like partially creepy it's super simple but there's a big impact to it I mean again I hope they follow through with this I hope an album comes into fruition that would be nice and you know I'm just gonna cross my fingers for it because the tip of the iceberg here sounds really good liking the new converge track over here new album coming out November 3rd I believe the track is titled reptilian awesome multifaceted track you know you have that noisy hard core element of converge but there's a very epic and heavy ending to it Kumasi washington has a new track out and titled desire which is off of a new EP that has been released now and it's just kind of like you know the same energetic jazz that I've enjoyed from him in the past but you know sort of delivered in a shorter song length you know it's a little bite-sized which is I guess with the theme of the EP that he has just dropped it's just like a 30 minute EP but so far sounds like there's a lot of quality tracks on it Jessie ware has a new Spanish version of a new single titled selfish love out which it's actually like even more beautiful and captivating than the original in my opinion I actually didn't hear the original until I heard this track maybe that's you know there's something to be said for that but honestly like the egoista refrain on here sticks with me so much more than the selfish love one does I mean this isn't going to be on the album unfortunately maybe a deluxe track down the road I'm not entirely sure but it I think it says a lot about the current state of music that you have American pop artists again releasing Spanish versions of songs and you know that used to happen quite a bit quite often in the 50s and the 60s but not so much of these days but now you know you have songs like des Paseo you know ruling the airwaves and you know being the most watched music video on YouTube obviously there is a huge market out there for Spanish music and it seems like it's growing to the point where now American and just generally english-speaking artists because Jesse where I believe hails from the UK I could be wrong on that but I believe she's from the UK you have english-speaking artists who want to tap into that market and it sounds like she's doing really well with with this Spanish version of selfish love again I do like the original track but the Spanish version is really kind of like hitting me hard and looking forward to her new album looking forward to the new record moving on from there shoutout to injury reserve who have an excellent new track out titled boom times 3 which I'm not gonna get too deep into because they have a new EP out now titled drive it like it's stolen these guys are a la vie Phoenix hip hop trio that I reviewed on a few occasions in the past they're excellent they're very talented you know they have a very unique sound and you know great lyrics great production you know very cutting edge very contemporary very bouncy very colorful and though this song is incredibly dark though compared to a lot of their other work as is this EP in general but that's all I'm gonna say about it because my review for this thing is coming out very soon just look for this EP get your hands on this EP get your ears on this EP it's really good and again shout out to injury reserve Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile have a new track out from their forthcoming collaborative record this one is titled continental breakfast and like with the last track that I heard I mean once again these two come together and I don't know man they just have excellent chemistry this track a lot like the previous single place to this wonderful self-aware sense of humor that it seems like you know both of them have internally and originally but it seems like they really kind of bring that out in one another in a really beautiful and entertaining way as they kind of talk about you know relationships and friendships across continental lines across the world and you know there are a lot of lyrics here that are very silly and tongue-in-cheek and playful and somewhat flirty and very feel-good like it's it's another great and well put together track and and vocally I think also Kurt and Courtney compliment each other really well so lyrically vocally instrumentally seems like they're just doing a lot for each other on this collaborative record and I'm just kind of really excited to hear despite the fact that I was very much underwhelmed by Courtney's last solo effort Kurt's last solo effort but together it just kind of seems like they're uh I don't know they're just really a hitting the nail on the head and finally shut it - Andrew savage of you know he's in so many bands Ferguson Geronimo like teenage cool kids there's there's so many bands that he's been in in in the past parquet courts but he has a new solo record coming out very soon and this new track over here is a kind of country honky-tonk key track that has you know some some pretty forlorn and very introspective lyrics on it that I thought were pretty cool and those are all the tracks that I wanted to shout out this week guys again those are the best tracks they're all linked down there in the description those are the meds those are the worst tracks once again reminding you that I have a tour coming up in October their West Coast states there are East Coast states you know freaking Seattle and New York and I'm in Massachusetts of course I'm in freakin California and all that and also our amazon associates like in our turntable lab link that has been the weekly track roundup hopefully you guys got some good recommendations out of this year the best love you mum muah forever 
S-elCjqboo0,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new killers album wonderful wonderful the killers are a las vegas rock band who have been writing and recording music for well over a decade up until this point I was kind of excited to listen to this new record even though prior I've never been a huge killer's fan but I thought the singles were really well recorded and performed and written so why the hell not however I'm not reviewing this album by myself I am taking this record on with my good friend and fellow YouTube critic Marc Grande and aka spectrum pulse whose channel you can check out down there in the description box we're going to have a very impassioned and a very friendly conversation about this new killers record once we hit the transition and here we are through the magic of the internet marker and and by my side aka spectrum pulse here to hash it out with me over this new Killers album Marc generally what were your thoughts on this album what was your take on the direction that the band took this new record in I think it's very important we say it right off the bait that in terms of the direction overall they took I can't see them a tremendous fan of it but that's more because from the background that I'm coming from with the killers I've always liked them when they've gone over the top it's almost borderline silly they've played for high melodrama and this record seems like they want to be taken a little bit more seriously so while I can see some of the quality there I can also say it wasn't quite as fun at least for me I can agree with you in that it seems overall like it is a more mature album you know they're not quite as ridiculous lyrically as they've been in the past however that's that's probably the most notable sense of a direction that you can pull from this album because stylistically I feel like the band is really all over the place maybe more all over the place and they've been in the past and in comparison with their past releases they're really kind of wearing their influences on their sleeve like in a big way on this album like their tracks on this thing that to me our dead ringers for artists that are very clearly big influences on them like life to come to me sounded like a great you to track you know like a really good track that you two may have dropped in the 90s meanwhile the calling to me sounded like a Depeche Mode song you know you know with it's a twang e very dark kind of like gothic cowboy get ours like kind of strutting their way all over the instrumental there there were just a lot of moments where I was just being hit by all of these sounds from other artists who I know the killers like that I know Brandon Flowers likes however wasn't necessarily a big distraction when the songwriting was quality you know certainly run for cover is a favorite of mine on here you know life to come again while I do you know see the big you to influence on that track it is a really big dramatic song with a huge infectious chorus love the introductory song I think that dance Rock angle the sort of disco angle of the man was really sharp and catchy as well and I would agree with most I would agree with a lot of that in terms of that you to influence I guess where it comes through and what became most distracting for me funny that you brought up run for cover is that because that song was originally intended to be packaged with day and age back in 2009 and you can sort of tell in terms of the tempo that they're bringing to that track it's a look it's one of the more rock inspired songs on that record and at the same time you can also see that in the lyrics cuz the references they are making to that Senator are actually from some senatorial scandal I think 2006 2007 with the tacked on reference to bring it up to relevancy yeah 27 to whose line and everything like that exactly and I see the influences but at the same time I'm not sure that the influences that I want to hear the killer is so obviously emulate like as much as Brandon Flowers is clearly channeling his meatloaf side on some of these songs with a lot of his delivery it's it be the sound as if 80s meatloaf wanted to front you too and as much as that can lead to some hysterical moments and like let's go to the fourth song life to come as much that is a u2 song it's got wines like what is it dropkick your shame away mmm and it's the sort of thing where I'm listening to this and I you want to be able to sucked into the gravitas and grandeur of the song and it just feels kind of silly at the end of the day I wish I could I wish I could buy into it more seriously because it's clear that flowers is selling it more seriously and it's bizarre that's not coming through and the whole and the weird thing is that considering Alex Cameron co-wrote five of the songs on this record you would think that more of his wit would have come through a little bit more of that flavor that he brought to his last album mmm also another thing that I want to know in terms of the influences here especially coming out of the vocals the man has a very very clear Talking Heads inspiration kind of like like for sure but to sort of add on top of what you were saying not that I don't want to hear these influences manifest themselves on a new killer's record but they do in such a disjointed way that it's hard to enjoy it as a complete record again another major influence on this record would be Brian Eno who on the song some Cline to love like they're essentially grabbing an ambient piece of his and kind of working it into this newly existing song and then kind of doing their thing on top of it which in my opinion the results kind of underwhelming you know it's sort of I think neuters their ability to structure the song in a sharp and direct way and it sort of leaves the song a little flaccid in my opinion I would agree if the song feels a little bit flaccid but I think there was a certain wistfulness to the track that ultimately compensated until you get to the line to quote this you have the soul of a truck on a long-distance drive and again if you're trying to structure these layers it's clearly a song he's trying to take seriously because if you read into a lot of the interviews he put out before going to the album part of the arc of this record is him is projecting that ultimate protector masculine figure and then seeing a lot of it being superseded by impulses for compassion realizing that that hyper-masculine figure is not gonna take you all the way that's one reason why the USDA certified lean line on the man was actually kind of witty and ingenious because it's funny moment it was tongue-in-cheek and it fit for the song but at the same time when you realize that songs like rut which is probably my personal favorite on the record just in terms of that ballad driven swell that's a song intended written from his wife's perspective who suffers from PTSD and it was intended to draw forth some elements of yeah I'm suffering from something that you can't help and then you have the song like some kind of love which is him responding to that and it's clear it's a very it's a very emotionally driven track and then you have lyrics that are just mmm this really push it in the weird direction there for me the the moments on the record that let me down lyrically and admittedly there weren't too many generally I am very much a fan of Brandon Flowers delivery and sort of the personality he brings forth in his lyrics I find him as my very captivating emotionally a really compelling performer like he does a good job of selling a lot of what he says even when I do feel like there are some lyrical shortcomings but when the lyrics in his delivery really fell short almost painfully for me was very much toward the end of the record on the calling that I brought up earlier where I don't think his singing was nearly as menacing as he might have wanted it to be like especially if he's trying to bring that level of biblical force exactly because there's some huge dark like devilish religious themes going on all over the lyrics on that track and just given the again the Depeche Mode vibe of that song and almost like the monie like Marilyn Manson ish quality of his singing on that track like he to me his singing reads too much like pretty boy for him to sell sort of their songs on that dark at an angle and for me the most and and we may disagree on this let me know the most lyrically disappointing moment on the entire record was the last track which I don't know man like it seemed like from the outset it was trying to be super tongue-in-cheek and very self-aware but I feel like it ended up just being painfully cheesy like I was kind of anticipating that song too because for a track to be titled have all the songs been written I would have loved The Killers to approach that idea purge that concept from the angle of you know like maybe but it we're gonna give it this huge attitude and just like you know mull over you know just completely just bulldoze expectations and you know blow up what everybody can sort of look forward to out of this kind of song but instead like they get really like weepy about all of it and it just ends up being like really pitiful and it's just yep honestly it just ends up sounding like a terrible song out of a Disney musical or something like it with with with like how um I guess overly saccharine and dramatic the instrumentation gets it points and I would agree with you there in terms of that particular song I think it's I don't think it's quite as bad as the calling for me because I just found that song just to be painfully tedious especially with Woody Harrelson doing the Bible the entire record he's not the sort of person do the intro like he's reading from the book of Matthew there and it's not a particularly good reading either but we get to that final song I was hoping there would be some element of self-awareness that would be able to bring that out even say like where all the even if even because the record is showing a little bit more maturity you think with that would come some self-awareness that doesn't really happen um but at the same time what drove me crazy about that song is how poorly it ended like a lot of these songs especially across most less album they hit these points where you're expecting them for a grand climactic finale and they just kind of sputter out mm and that laughs and the last song was the prime example of that if you're going for that sort of pop bombast it ends up coming off like it honestly reminded me a little bit of when Barry Manilow made I write the songs with him coming with them coming out as a response and yet their response is so weak in comparison mm-hmm no that's absolutely true and I guess another thing that comes to mind is not just with the endings but sometimes just on structural details alone some of these tracks do suffer from some problems like to go back to the man there was a moment where in the second half I don't know if you caught it but it's almost like a certain section of the song ends like a bar early and there's a weird edit where all of a sudden the groove changes really fast were clearly the way they put that together was in post like they didn't perform it like that like they cut up section of a song like a bar too early so the groove was sort of off and then it sort of suddenly transitioned into something else and it was like one of the weirdest segues on the entire record and there was that but I thought a lot of the grooves he'll he felt really oddly structured on this record even the title track that opened things up where it begins up with these spacious effects and then tries to bring in that deep thrumming bass line but in terms of whether or not it actually hit real impact for me I thought a lot the percussion felt really gated along a lot of this record especially a lot of the vocals they felt oddly compressed in terms of matching up against the really one that a lot of the record felt very compressed it felt very very like crushed down and almost like claustrophobic which is odd because if you're going to sample Eno in some variety you're gonna interpolate that you'd think that you'd have a little bit more a better sense of spatial dynamics across the songs but the one that really bothered me as much as I found the song kind of endearing was out of my mind because you like I liked the music references I liked how he was trying to communicate something through his art form to be able to arouse this person out of their stupor and it didn't work and it's clear it didn't work but at the same time what drove me crazy was how compressed the vocals felt and how rigidly structured the drums were and you know what there's a place for that but at the end of the day I'm going back to a record like battleborn where the first half of that record is supremely silly but it's over the top in a way that actually can manage us to pay off those grooves and I go back to out of my mind I'm saying you know what I like this but I liked it a lot better five years ago what it was called deadlines and commitments so overall what are you feeling on this record like did you enjoy it did you not enjoy it and what do you feeling as far as like a raid on this album and where does it fit for you in the scope of the Bands entire discography like are they at a high point right now a low point I don't want to say it's their worst record because I don't think it is but at the same time I'd like to say that I liked more of this than I didn't because at the end of the day I like Brandon Flowers delivery I like the swell behind this record I like a lot of the ideas and you know what when they tilt into pure broad silliness it can connect for me but it doesn't look like they're gonna be doing that consistently going forward and Brandon Flowers himself made something very very variant well it's kind of self-aware he said this he says I feel like I write a lot of sixes and sevens I believe that because for me this is a strong six and a light seven hey it's coming from the horse's mouth there's so you can't really disagree I guess me myself I'm I'm probably like balls deep on probably like four tracks on this record and even those tracks and if I were to throw in a few more that I really enjoy you know but I'm not like crazy about even even if I were to compile all those tracks given just how jumpy this album is stylistically none of it really kind of builds on top of itself for me you know it doesn't really reinforce itself it's almost like I'm listening to a compilation in a way yes you know which is sort of unfortunate that there's not sort of a more consistent musical thread kind of pulling all of this together I guess I kind of enjoy just hearing some of the tunes on here I enjoy hearing the band dabble in some of their very obvious influences a bit here and there but it's not very cohesive as an album you know like it's kind of likeable for what it is but it's nothing really special like obviously I wasn't turning away from this record and discussed until I hit the very very very end but I feel like the lead up until that point was pretty you know it consistent as far as just enjoyability but is it some kind of grandeur amazing or fantastic artistic statement not really and and I would fully agree probably like a light six on this thing I think the thing that's always held the killer's back at this point is that if you know what for being this many years into their career but is it like that it's calm Oh some 15 years into their career they haven't made an album that feels like it's a consistent statement and then they aren't structuring albums in that way they've always seemed like more of a singles band but if they're trying to be taken more seriously and they're not putting forward more of that album statement at this point again it feels a little bit like 80s meatloaf and the kitten Brandon Flowers is no Jim Steinman mmm all

Und3xhfJUsU,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and here is a quickie review of the new wolves in the throne room album thrice woven wolves in the throne room if you didn't know are an Olympia Washington black metal band whose output in the 2000s brought a lot of Americans into the black metal fold and you know that's for better or for worse it did create some growing pains in the black metal community where you had this new crop of very atmospheric and somewhat experimental hipster black metal bands that turned a lot of people off and got a lot of people angry whatever your opinion on that is I don't care I enjoy wolves in the throne room I enjoy 12 stars I enjoy two hunters I enjoy some of the material they put out after that however after they sort of went away from there to hunters sound into a series of Records or a couple of records that were much more dry and skeletal and stripped back by comparison the excitement of the band's music sort of waned for me because I feel like they're dramatic and panoramic presentation was part of what made them so interesting to begin with however on their last record celestite the band suddenly went into an ambient and a drone direction which hardcore fans that enjoy them up until that point may not have liked hearing them go that route but personally I felt that record was kind of a breath of fresh air and to a degree this new album is as well because they go into a more atmospheric and a more sonically dense direction which is a direction I enjoy hearing the band come from in their music however this record just was not sticking with me despite how many times I would listen to it despite how much I did enjoy the sonic qualities of this album and I think it has a lot to do with some of the writing and performances being kind of bland being kind of predictable and being kind of safe at this point for wolves in the throne room I was kind of expecting some more stops to be pulled out or some more bells and whistles or experimentation or excitement especially given that the band has proven themselves to be a group that suddenly can drop an ambient or a drone album out of nowhere and it ends up like pretty good but I feel like again they play a little safe here kind of predictable and the chord progressions the music composition of these songs just was really not sticking with me like I do enjoy some of the detours the band takes throwing in some near ambient passages a little spoken word here and there some beautiful and large female choral vocals which are very pretty and play very nicely against the harsh guitars but there are so many things about the writing on this record that are so underwhelming not to mention that the vocals I think could have used so much more presence like they're so obscured on this record more than they have been in the past and they really don't sort of bring the fire in brimstone and kind of chillingly hellish vibe that they have in the past so while there are some elements of this record that I really do enjoy the sound the structure of some of these songs the fact that the band is is toying with a sound that I enjoy a bit more I am still underwhelmed by the substance and the core of these songs in the writing process because it's it's just not really that special you know or that unique or that envelope pushing for them and in my opinion so yeah you know I am just a little underwhelmed by this record unfortunately despite the fact that I went into this thing expecting good things expecting a bit of a black metal redemption here not only because I felt underwhelmed by some of their past work but because they're kind of coming back off of a drone and ambient album but that just was kind of not the case for me unfortunately but what did you guys think of this record did you love it did you hate it why generally I think it is a pretty likeable record but certainly not anything I'm going to be coming back to anytime soon over here next to my head is a another wolves in the throne room review that you can check out or hit the link to subscribe to the channel I'll see you guys in the next one wolves in the throne room thrice woven forever 
-9vTnqL7W4s,"hey everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd doing a quick and a raw review here of the new young thug and carnage EP young Martha young thug Atlanta a rapper crooner eccentric carnage DJ producer no no more introduction needed at this point I'm guessing he dropped an incredible single earlier this year titled homie featuring Meek Mill which was attached to an amazing music video by the way but this song is one of the year's most insane and off the wall bangers I have heard like the bass is crazy and young thug on this beat is delivering this crazy Cookie Monster performance and at first I thought it was somebody else but like what I actually figured out that it was him going this insane on the cut I was like holy crap like this is this is a little much and I actually enjoyed hearing him go that crazy go that animated on a cut like it definitely felt like he was really trying to push the envelope there like young thug his vocalizations and his vocal performances they're pretty crazy they're pretty insane sometimes he does play it a little too safe in my opinion and just sort of gives a stereotypical performance for for himself but every once in a while man and and this track is an example he just totally reaches a new level and just you know just just when you think you've heard young thug do vocally everything he's ever gonna do he just just like Wow's me and he does that almost consistently on every single song here like if you want to consistently hear young thug be left field and be weird and just be as eccentric as you know he has the potential to be you have to hear this EP because not only is homie a great kicker and an amazing track but the following cuts are equally as impressive liger has a great groove - it almost has like this bass and synth pad urn to it that sort of reminds me of like I don't know like a lot of migos production but maybe Metro boomin or something but there's kind of a very sweet like woodwind melody in there that I like quite a bit young thug is a little Yelp e'er and a little more out there than usual on this track it's very hooky it's very sweet it's got a you know a nice sort of vibe e energy to it and then following that 10,000 slimes it's the most low-key track and the track listing here but there's a seriously like moody and mournful tone to the song especially coming out of thugger 'zv ocol performance here that I like a lot like it's is very much a sad moment on the EP it really kind of gets me down I I do enjoy sort of the sudden emotional shift there and just how well the track is performed and then don't call me The Closer on this thing buggers yell penis and nasal miss is just astronomical on this thing to the point where he's just like reaching into registers where he's straining so hard and like I can barely even explain it and describe it because it's it's just it's such a like profoundly weird moment for him vocally I love this thing I think it's really good I just wish there was more to say about it I wish there was more material on here like considering how exciting and saw the material is here like I would love to hear more from these two in the future I hope this isn't all that we ever hear from young Martha as where I hope that this EP just ends up being a taster because not only do I think that carnage and Fugger bring out the best in each other on this thing but I do think this is legitimately one of the better EPS of the year what do you think of this thing if you've given it a listen do you love it do you hate it why what do you think I should review next and over here next to my head is another young thug review that you can check out or you can click on the link to subscribe to the channel you're the best I'll catch you guys in the next review forever "
sviePujguak,ah hi everyone sectionals here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Chelsea wolf album hiss spun this is the latest album from the siren of tortured gothic song miss Chelsea wolf whose artistic progression really started turning heads back in 2010 I really enjoyed the noisy ethereal dark art rock direction but also like a little funkiness here and there on her apocalypsis album in 2011 she went slightly more synthetic like embracing like a very kind of dark wave sound on her next record pain is beauty explored some acoustic cuts on unknown rooms and then plunged listeners into a deep despondent like impossibly dark sonic abyss on her last full-length record abyss her heaviest and most enveloping album thus far with each record it's almost like Chelsea takes on a slightly different aesthetic or pulls from a different set of influences which is one of my favorite things about her and this time around on his spun I am catching a lot of notes of doom metal and Atmospheric sludge metal and the riffs and the drumbeats and the slow monolithic pace of a lot of these songs the blaring guitars the down-tuned distorted rib cage rattling bass it's a style that generally I like a lot but I can be kind of picky with my doom metal obviously heaviness and pace are a factor and kind of what makes the music what it is but it's not enough to simply be loud like the best doom metal artists in my opinion are ones that successfully perform this balancing act between playing this really slow glacial cerebral style of metal music but also keep things engaging and kind of visceral and there are countless bands that play it so slow and so bland and so predictable that their music becomes tedious just one minute into a seven-minute song now unfortunately there are at least a few tracks on this new album over here that fall into that category I was kind of shocked at how subpar the opener is this is the riffs on this thing are kind of generic like very run-of-the-mill when it comes to this genre but potentially the worst thing about this track is the aimless and endless and painfully awkward guitar soloing all over the song it's trying way too hard to be sinister and really feels like it's trapped in this really basic minor scale progression I'm not even sure if I really care for the way Chelsea's cavernous vocals are playing against these riffs which in comparison with a lot of the guitars on her previous work are very raw very dry very heavy very upfront meanwhile Chelsea's voice disembodied ghostly voice feels kind of disconnected from it all thankfully the album picks up pretty quickly after this with some lead singles like sixteen psyche which upon more listens reads to me is like this monolithic take on 90s alternative metal and rock especially with the despondent verses and the driving quarter note rips on the hook this era of rock has long been an influence on Chelsea's music it's cool to hear that it's still an influence on Chelsea's music and that she was able to twist it into this heavier darker more devilish style on this new album the loud soft dynamic on this track does wear on me after a little while though it seems kind of obvious and it is done better later on the album with the song twin faun I'm not really wowed by the tune of this track either outside of Chelsea's haunting vocals soaring over to the thunderous guitars on the hook the song VEX features this really hypnotic drum beat that's like four eighth notes it sounds like on the bass drum and then four more on the snare bump it's got a great like lurking slithering groove to it that reminds me of like some early marilyn manson and chelsea singing on this track is the first time on this record where she hits me with this vocal performance that really sends chills up my spine and there's also like some growling male death metal style vocals that pop up later in the track and adds so much personality so much texture so much gruffness the instrumentation behind all of it and like swells in this hellish fashion my only major disappointment with the cut is just its sudden finish given the intensity given the heaviness given just how well the song had been going up until that point I feel like there just could have been more to it especially given that there are longer tracks on this thing that don't exactly justify their length like the song particle flux whose driving baseline and repetitive lead vocals kind of lose their stur before the song was big explosive finish at the very end the song strain is a pretty decent interlude add some nice somewhat electronic textures into the mix it's a point on the album where Chelsea subtly brings in these more industrial influences which I wish showed up in a bigger way on the rest of the album rather than just kind of being a side dish on these shorter songs I mean for this influence to show itself more proudly on the rest of the record I think would have made the album generally more sonically interesting and it would have been a pretty easy incorporation given just how close industrial metal is to the goth world that Chelsea holds sympathies for well more than sympathy she's like the princess of the gothic realm for me tracks like welt and offering while I did enjoy the sound of these shorter tracks they just kind of felt like they were placeholders thrown into the track listening to kind of break up the do me er heavier spots on the record the song culling was a another highlight for me I loved the songs very subtle and very nuanced and tension building quiet introduction it eventually hits listeners with this rumbling bass and some primal drums at the halfway point then there's a powerfully heavy second half one of the more refreshing structures in the tracklisting here and I loved the chillier and more acoustic take on the song to spirit the guitars drone very loudly when the song hits it's emotional intensity point the vocal melodies are one of the few points and Chelsea Wolf's entire discography where I would I would call them sultry they were pretty sultry and the song scraped while I do wish it finish the record off in a bigger fashion it is a highlight for me on this record for a few reasons I mean for one Chelsea's vocals on this track seems so much more up front close and tangible on this track more than they do on any other song and honestly it's a great change of pace like to have that close aggressive vocal intimacy with her on such a loud blaring crushing track was actually exhilarating while I do enjoy her very reverb Ian cavernous aesthetic there is an element of obscurity that comes with that and in my opinion Chelsea when it comes to her vocals really has nothing to hide and that is proven on this track again very powerful crushing finish mostly an exciting and to the album overall I thought this record was decent it's not one of my favorites that Chelsea has put out this decade but it's certainly an admirable release with more hits than misses but in my opinion the songwriting was just a tad inconsistent Chelsea's foray into this heavier slower style does come with its growing pains it's awkward moments its missteps however no reason not to look forward to what she's doing in the future because most likely that's going to be something different as well a lot of quality tracks on this thing and diehards for super heavy metal music are likely to enjoy this thing even more than I do I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this thing transition have you given

mJAD92rWdZI,hi everyone slam music and it's time for review of the new Macklemore album Gemini Macklemore is a Seattle rapper this is his latest full-length album officially splitting off from super producer Ryan Lewis on this thing the guy who helped put Macklemore on the map by giving him the instrumentals to the songs that he broke into the mainstream with like wings and thrift shop now I enjoyed their debut album together the heist I thought it was relatively solid I realized that Macklemore when he blew up afterwards he sort of became an unexpected figurehead for things like same-sex marriage thanks to the song same love and I understand that he caught some heat for that but like he did not anticipate for that track or this entire record to blow up he made all of this material before he and Ryan were even really relevant it wasn't till the thrift shop music video that was released long after the album had actually dropped where he blew up however there was like a bit of added outside pressure because Mac Lamar's rise to popularity was just so fast and I don't really think he handled much of it all that gracefully especially as he was being so annoyingly apologetic for winning a Grammy over Kendrick Lamar's good kid maad city which yeah it's it's the better hip hop record but just like it's it's a Grammy you know it doesn't mean anything I do admire him for keeping it independent and doing things on his own terms even as the quality of his music kind of dropped off on his next record with Ryan and I don't know I mean the the singles leading up to this new record over here they were kind of unsurprising and generic like nothing really stuck out to me didn't seem like Macklemore was trying to make all that much in the way of a serious political statement which is kind of odd because everything seems more political than ever in this day and age so I find it kind of ironic that Macklemore really seems like he's trying super hard to avoid anything political on this new album but you know I'm just kind of riffing here because honestly it's kind of hard to organize my thoughts about this album because it's just so truly bad like this this is the worst thing McLemore has done I know McLemore got a bad rap before for being corny and wearing his heart on his sleeve and trying too hard to put politics into his music and edited that but this album is is really just inexcusable and and kind of just just gets me thinking what happened this album is a mix of large grand epic Hornbeck trap anthem something that you would typically expect from Macklemore but it kind of just seems like a lesser version it's less over-the-top it's less inspiring just kind of seems smaller scale it's almost like I'm listening to b-sides and leftovers from his last record especially the intro track featuring foxy Shazam's Erik nalli who's shrill screaming voice right at the start of the album is like what one of the worst auditory experiences on the entire project and then when we get to glorious featuring Skylar Grey it's it's almost like I'm just listening to Macklemore rip himself off and when he's not ripping himself off on this thing he's ripping off other artists who had much trendier sounds like on the song marmalade which just kind of seems like a carbon copy of the song broccoli by DRAM right down to the little yachty feature even the plinky piano is here in the be given the flute isn't in the instrumental but there is quite a bit of auto-tune on the vocals like it just seems really apparent that McLemore had a particular song in mind when he made this track shout-out to DRAM though he's not gonna sue shout-out to DRAM the song 10-million has some pretty meaningful lyrics on it but I can't help but just get distracted from the fact that many of the verses just sound like he's pulling from Drake a little too hard meanwhile the be on over it sounds like an imagine dragons instrumental that instead of exploding gloriously on the hook it just kind of farts the song fire-breathers yet another cut I don't think is that bad from a flow standpoint or a lyrical standpoint but the beat features this shoddy guitar riff that is a total ripoff of Jimi Hendrix foxy lady I mean that's it it just sounds like I'm listening to a dollar store version of foxy lady and the featured rapper on corner store sounds exactly like chance the rapper like Jesus Christ he didn't even try not to sound like chance the rapper I mean it's it's it's obvious that he's trying to sound like chance the rapper I was actually surprised when I looked at the feature credits and he wasn't chance the rapper I mean at first I thought wow the chance is on this thing he sounds a little weird but I don't know like it's so painfully obvious that he's trying to get the instrumental to rip off the social experiment to I mean almost every guest singer on this record sounds like a faceless version of a more popular artist I guess I just don't get how McLemore has the guts to so blatantly recycle every relevant idea coming from his contemporaries on one single album and yet rap about how there's like no father to his style so we have tracks that sound like runoff from other rappers runoff from macklemore's older work but hey you know honestly what's even worse than that are the lyrics now there are some high points here lyrical high points that are kind of funny kind of cute like endearing which has been the case with macklemore's work in the past but I feel like with no message to relay to his fans here or no cause to stand for on this record it's almost like what low lyrical standards he had for himself in the past have just kind of gotten thrown out the window like on the opening bars to the song Willy Wonka and the hook on this track but if that's not enough to make you his skip I don't know what is I did I was triggered the song intentions features this painfully cliched and gross set of guitar chords like it's supposed to be this really intimate like cute song the instrumental was so goddamn sugary it sounds like he's rapping over some royalty-free YouTube music bed which is really brave of McLemore for him to be rapping over such a thing by the way but not as brave as as these lyrics wow he's really just acknowledging the the the plight of human humanity I want to be a feminist but I'm still watching porno I don't know if anyone has told Macklemore but there is a whole institution of sex-positive feminism out there that you know may disagree with him Macklemore you know not a a feminist scholar who to thunk it and while again I mentioned the song firebreather as being one track that has some pretty clever witty funny lyrics in it but this line about the critics gentrifying bed-stuy listen I don't live there I wouldn't be caught dead there but it's almost like Macklemore portrays his critics as only being white or only being privileged as if he doesn't have critics that are black and while we're talking about gentrification I mean isn't he kind of gentrifying a whole genre here on the song over it we have some really gross disgusting stalking your ex over social media bars kind of creepy very creepy actually and I just can't really stand the lyrical subject matter of the songs are either like this woman that he portrays himself with she's such a she's such a free spirit she reads bell hooks and Cornel West and makes you case' Dilla's for me the most enjoyable and heartwarming moment on the entire record actually came in the shape of the very last track here where lyrically I got this vibe where he was genuinely hurt scarred and kind of just stressed over the fact that he's experienced this rejection that came simultaneously with his growth there's very sudden growth in popularity which is a problem that I know a lot of artists go through when they make that transition from underground to mainstream because while Macklemore may have changed a lot artistically since his earliest days as a rap artist he as a person may feel like he's the same person and worthy of the same respect and likeability as he was in the past and this track convinced me that that is most likely the case at least on a personal level especially as he goes into a lot of bars about being a father and just the enjoyment that he gets out of that and to be honest I also enjoy the very funky levitate has one of the better flows some of the better verses on here the drum be on this thing and bassline is pretty much irresistible to my ears though I am kind of a new by that one moment where he's impersonating this girl who he's meeting and she's like oh I just googled you and I also kind of enjoy the charismatic track banger how to play the flute but honestly these three songs I just mentioned are really the only tracks on this entire record that I would return to like there are so many subpar tracks on this thing so many ripoff instrumentals so many cringy bars the flow is so spotty and inconsistent the album doesn't really have a strong sonic concept to it with Ryan Lewis out of the picture Macklemore seems content to try to do anything and everything and that's led to a series of tracks where he's kind of stepping outside of his comfort zone and failing or delivering to listeners a lesser version of what he's done in the past I'm feeling a strong to to a light 3 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I earn

-K0wHtAc1t8,Oh hi everyone the Internet's busiest music nerd hearing Anthony Fantana and it's time for review of the new god speed you black Emperor album Luciferian towers this is the brand new record from Montreal post rock outfit Godspeed you black Emperor who in the 90s and 2000's were one of the most cutting-edge bands in the monolithic and incredibly epic genre of post rock not just monolithic and epic but also beautiful and majestic they released a handful of fantastic records during their time as a band Bam Bam Bam but the band kind of decided to call it quits after their 2002 record Yankee UXO after which a lot of the band's members sort of fractured off in a different musical projects kind of disappointing to go through one of the worst presidencies in American history without sort of god speeds incredibly political and powerful and apocalyptic composition style but the band did make a somewhat grand return about ten years later with their 2012 album don't bend ascend which was essentially a very fresh performance and recording laid on to something the band had written a while back it sort of brought back the original Thunder and excitement of their sound but with kind of a modernized more punchy aesthetic and while I do love that album I think it's a great addition to their discography ultimately I was excited to see what the band would deliver once they started writing fresher material I was also kind of excited to hear what exactly the messaging of the band's music would be given that Obama at the point of release of the following album asunder wasn't really delivering on his promises of hope and change outside of you know I I hope will will actually get some change however I just found this album to be a mild attempt at recycling what made godspeed such a good group in the first place sure the band presented a sea of large dramatic instrumentation on this thing but not much else and in my opinion Luciferian towers is just as underwhelming if not more this thing features four movements that pan out to 45 minutes and while the band does bring that somewhat punky symphonic rock fusion that you typically expect from a speed you black emperor album this record is kind of more style than substance like the instrumental meat of this record is so underwhelming like the intro undoing Luciferian towers the track is kind of this droney introductory piece that's like this blobby formless flabby bunch of instrumental layers bass horns strings electronics it's dense but it doesn't really resolve into anything all that exciting for the seven minutes that it lasts also as the band is droning and experimenting the sense of adventure and wonder and just cutting edge interesting sounds that would typically be embedded in a godspeed drone or just nowhere to be found at one point the limping bass and cycling noise kind of give way to some cool horn sections and then the band delivers some very slow sweeping string melodies that feel almost like a leftover from their last record and with the first track over and with there only being three other major cuts to speak of the band is yet to capture that I don't know sense of prophetic dread that has made their past work so amazing it seems like slow riffs enhanced by strings are pretty much the only idea the band has to offer when they get heavy and they get intense which is okay but it sort of takes the sense of nuance and tension and building and experimentation that I've come to expect up until this point has a god speed fan the song bosses hang is cut up into three sections but each part of this track feels like its own miniature rushed post rock song the build-up to the finish of these tracks is not really all that interesting and each finish of each section of the song comes to the same slow riff it's kind of mind-boggling it's like a listening to the same idea reiterated from three different angles on the same album like a musical choose-your-own-adventure but you end up at the same ending no matter what and if this track wasn't indicative of the band kind of being out of ideas there is the fam slash famine drone which brings lots of instrumental density but that doesn't necessarily mean anything really is happening especially when the track glides and the same folky but also kind of gospel string melodies that seem to inform near every track here the best song on this entire project is easily anthem for no state but the song is hardly a saving grace for the record and I wouldn't even say it would even I don't know begin to go toe to toe with any of the great work the band has put out in the past the chilling intro on this thing actually kind of got me biting my nails a little bit the lonely guitar leads the dreary strings the ghostly tones filling the atmosphere created by the instrumentation the second section of the track is a bit of a snooze fest it's kind of very low-key twangy guitar waltz kind of reminds me of like an earth song off of bees made honey in the lion's skull but with less interesting chord phrasing and then the bright horns and thunderous bass and guitar layers that end the song out in the last section are one of the most exciting moments on the entire record really epic lead melody is interesting instrumental layers and progressions some of the whaling instrumentation on this track has this wavy disorienting quality to it that I like a lot however this moment is just a slightly passionate thrill on a generally passionless and Thrillist album I'm not really sure what to say about this album it's just kind of one uninteresting track after the next it sort of pulls through in the end but not enough to actually make the record worth it or gratifying this is just really kind of the first godspeed project I feel like we we just did not need and I sort of wonder what the band is even going to do after this point because this is just underwhelming the the peak of underwhelming I'm feeling a light five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I

EnGPUH911nU,
dODwQFcIoKE,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd I hope you're doing well and I don't know if you've heard but but means they're the future of music promotion yes yes they're yours truly has been a passionate follower of both music and meme culture for quite a long time before this YouTube channel that you're watching this on was even a figment of my imagination but I never thought I would see a time where the two intertwined in such a way where it's almost like they're thriving off of each other in the modern day and for the foreseeable future now this is nothing entirely new I mean I spent a whole lot of time during college trolling the music board on 4chan where I saw some of the weirdest and most hilarious jokes about some of my favorite bands a lot of which were pretty obscure and left-field like the kind of thing that you would only get if you were really into some alternative styles of music and comedy and while it hasn't been without its growing pains it's been pretty fascinating seeing the absurd style of comedy memes bring to the table grow mutate and almost become mainstream thanks to gigantic social media platforms and web sites like Reddit and Facebook and Twitter and the now-defunct vine and snapchat as well as Instagram and who can forget YouTube in 2017 memes have transcended mere internet tomfoolery and are now used routinely as vehicles for social commentary ideological or cultural identity artistic vision and a means to express the deepest darkest depths of human depravity but what I am most interested in for the sake of this video is meme consumption and creation as a reflection of relevance or popularity as I said earlier memes and music have created this weird marriage over the past decade which seems to be hitting a real peak this year especially with this new wave of up-and-coming soundcloud rappers that have really been taking the hip hop culture by storm and their popularity has resulted in one of the biggest waves of music centric memes this year from the opening bars of Denzel Curry's ultimate which was featured on countless vines to some of xxx tenth Ozzie owns more aggressive and blown-out saw that served a similar purpose as a kind of aggressive crescendo or explosion point also many of his moody mug shots not to mention the overly edgy devil excel cypher performance which was remixed over and over and over and over and then you have little pump and ugly God whose careers respectively have pretty much been on meme life-support because each of them only have a few truly viral songs to their name but you could argue these guys have more hip memes and they do hit songs from that hilarious video an image of ugly God putting a lizard on his nose to let me slip in one single point here need I remind you that one of the biggest releases of the year was a literal meme rap album from a meme rap artist pink guy and the Mema fication of modern music on the Internet has been a long and slow process whose origins are kind of spotty but it was majorly snowball toward the beginning by little B now the memes that orbit these guys are more than just jokes they are a sign that people are engaged with what they're doing and engagement and attention is valuable the phenomenon of short attention spans on the Internet is real especially with young audiences although it is not entirely the fault of Millennials because with the saturation of audio-visual content on every corner of the Internet there's actually very little online that's truly worth your attention keep watching this video though I fuckin beg you but if something someone creates and throws out there into the internet abyss actually resonates with someone actually is impactful or awful enough to stop somebody and many other people in their tracks chances are even if for a short time a community online will form around that thing and from that community will sprout memes now a lot of these jokes typically are very inside and meant only for people who are truly in the know but sometimes those memes and that humor gains a life all its own and almost acts like an advertisement a calling card enticing Internet users that kind of want to know what all the hubbub is about I mean I don't think it's a coincidence that things like the shmoney dance and raindrop drop top are doing huge numbers on the Internet before the songs those references come from we're doing huge numbers on the charts not to mention things like Metro boomin x' don't trust you watermark or like that picture of little easy vert in that raggedy-ass hot topic look at D shirt jokes like this do quite a bit to expand the names of these artists outside of the trap asphere artists who are on the come-up becoming somewhat more popular through memes is one thing but artists who are very popular already embracing and endorsing memes that kind of creates this really loud feedback loop between that person and their fans so loud that it's almost deafening is another like Drake performing in front of a set of memes and reference to the beef that him and meek Mill had where Meek took a really hard L back in 2015 which drew everyone's attention on to that beef so many people were paying attention to this thing already because you had two of the biggest rappers in the game going back and forth trading tracks trading disses but the fact that everybody was making fun of it in such a clever fashion with a hilarious set of memes just added a whole different dynamic and ballgame to the whole thing and then for Drake to elevate in platform what he thought were some of the funniest of those is just amazing and that thing only influences and encourages people to make more of those memes and how in this video can I not mention Death Grips whose fanbase in my opinion could most easily be categorized as like a meme sweatshop proselytizing for this trailblazing cutting-edge experimental hip-hop trio with some twisted mashups photoshop's lyrical edits and savage internet trolling all of this has made Death Grips fans one of the most notorious fandoms for any musical artist online so the point I'm trying to bring home is that memes are reflective of popularity but also intensity of that popularity like it's no surprise that Kendrick Lamar with just how much of a tour de force his latest album has been as far as dominating the charts this album cycle for the album damn has been his most meme centric album cycle from all the reaction gifts to come out of his music videos to all of the quotables on some of the songs from that record to the many many many album photo shops and there's a genius remix of the song humble where nearly every word in the song is syrup sandwiches all of this intense focus and passion and engagement is money online because today attention clicks equals cash and that engagement makes money whether it's positive or negative and it's not surprising that you have record companies and major corporations looking for ways to cash in whether that be with the signing of Danielle cash me aside bergoglio Atlantic Records or Gucci recently commissioning a series of memes to advertise their overpriced wares but for the most part both of these things have warranted a collective groan on the Internet but still memes and engagement make money companies are not going to give up on this they're eventually going to get their foot in the meme door because there's value in it and it's only a matter of time before they crack the code with a more subtle approach case in point check out this recent NBC interview with this guy cash he's a professional Instagram meme creator the interview is linked down below in in this video he talks about making memes being commissioned to make memes for particular music artists in order to give people the illusion that that artist is more popular than he or she actually is because for the most part when you see six seven eight nine ten different memes about one particular person you assume that those memes all came from different people like wow this person must have a really passionate fan base people keep making memes about this guy and even if maybe a single watermark from one single person ends up on all of those memes if the jokes are funny and plentiful enough it may just tip the scales and tempt you into trying what exactly these memes are advertising so our means the future of music promotion I mean honestly I would pretty much advocate that they are the now it's already happening I see no sign of is stopping in fact it's probably only gonna ramp up in the future so as an artist a creator or somebody who manages artists and creators or works for a label what exactly do you do from here I mean I would recommend not faking it not forcing it but embracing it and how you're exactly gonna go about doing that is kind of to you I hope you guys enjoyed this video I'll see you in the next one hope hopefully I stirred the pot on this one got you guys thunking on this you're the best transition what did you think of this video did you look did you hate it do you agree disagree you hit me down in the comments let me know over here next to my head is another thing peace you can check out and click on or you can click on the link to you subscribe to the channel I'll see you guys in the next one

mix of kind of you know memes lecture and just all-around silliness and let's get into the worst tracks of the week everyone without any further ado hmm there's some bad ones this week guys so I'm kind of dreading flipping on over but hey you know what we got to do it let's do it Oh deep breaths deep breaths someone's texting me all right okay just okay let's go Noah Cyrus again new song featuring xxx 10th Accio and goddamn the industry is just forcing this guy's done everybody's third the song is awful the song is like literally trash it is garbage the only thing I really like about this song is the instrumental which has some really kind of quirky weird glitchy edits but Noah Cyrus I don't know who influenced her to sing or start releasing some singles but her voices really generic and not special in any way whatsoever like she has some decent singing fundamentals but there's really nothing about her singing voice that's all that interesting and it's kind of weird for her to almost go into a pop trap rap Direction mix now that her sister has kind of abandoned and sort of left that sound entirely an ex on this track oh god he's kind of singing in this really whiny wimpy vocal that's kind of cringe II and I don't know man like I feel like you can't portray yourself as this really edgy guy that doesn't play well with others and you're totally different than any other artist and you you do you you you don't you don't gel with the rest of the rap game you you know you're taking down the false prophets you you don't you don't play well with others you're smarter than the average bear but then all of a sudden you're on a Noah Cyrus track like come on man we're supposed to take you seriously as is you know again the Lord of Darkness here come on give me a break this song is garbage along with this new Niall Horan song now it's it's not total trash the thing is it's just kind of generic pop and acoustic rock much of what he's been delivering so far but instrumentally it seems a little bit more fleshed out a little bit more dense but it hasn't made his songwriting any more enticing honestly like I what he's doing with his solo career is just so run of the mill and so average there's there's really nothing to speak of really it's a really underwhelming and of course I'm not really that much into the new Miley Cyrus track week without you of course I have to say the new Neal song is titled too much to ask but again week without you really annoying country tinged pop rock here and for whatever reason on this recent crop of tracks Miley's voice is annoying me even more than usual it's like there's kind of a I don't know a rawness to it that wasn't there in her earlier years or her vocals were just a little more dolled up these days it kind of feels like they're just sort of letting that foghorn quality of her voice just ring out there uninterrupted however her voice isn't that deep it's kind of like a little foghorn and it's pretty annoying and it's it's really not pleasurable to listen to it all however not quite as annoying as the new a boogie with the hoodie single say a say say yeah say a say yay which has one of the most tedious lead melodies of any of these kind of glitzy glamorous melodic trap ballads that I've heard in a long time really redundant song although I am loving that the single cover art here is kind of reminiscent of teenage girls squad from Homestar Runner and there you go those are the tracks that I thought were the worst tracks the weak get these tracks out of my face especially this one which again to me hot garbage all right Suns that I was met on tracks that I wanted to shout out I wasn't crazy about them but I wanted to you know at least make you guys aware of them yung lean new song now I'm surprised at how much I'm either liking or tolerating this recent output from yung lean like it's not anything that much different than what he typically does you do have the Spacey trap instrumental you do have the auto-tune on the vocals you do have the somewhat lazy singing however I feel like his song structure and I feel like his sense of melody is so much more on with these couple of new tracks than they have been in the past so I don't know man it's it's pretty catchy what he's been doing lately and I'm looking forward to potentially listening to a new album from him and maybe kind of hearing him grow a bit stylistically as an artist but again I am kind of enjoying this new song titled hunting my own skin digging on this new wu-tang track which also features Redman like the previous track did not quite as fiery but you know certainly a boom bap banger with some decent verses some decent flows and vocal performances I dig it quite a bit the new okay this this is kind of a weird special thing here the band beach slang a member from beach slang is kind of splitting off and I just dropped something and is recording music under the name quiet slang and has a new EP coming and apparently it's like reworks of other songs and this track that I wanted to point you guys to thirteen is a big star cover and it's a pretty cool cover so I'm pretty much shouting out this cover song over here so quiet slang aka beach slang Beach star cover new EP reworked songs this one it's pretty good give it a shot very pleasurable you know sticks to the you know the piano and kind of 70s vibe of the original track but a little bit more mellow and a little bit more I guess I'm kind of blissful and relaxing got to give a shout out to Danielle burr goalie who before I think I've referred to as bad Bobby although it is bad baby and this new song ha bitch havoc havoc I actually think it's kind of fun like it's it's obviously trash but at least it's fun trash and seriously like people are freaking the fuck out in the hip-hop community about the fact that she is gaining so much attention she's getting signed to Atlantic Records and you know she's not a real rapper she's not a real this she's not a real that listen to what she's doing on this track and tell me straight to my face that she isn't living up to the standards that pretty much every other low-grade WorldStarHipHop trap rapper isn't living up to right now she is they have set the bar low so when you set the bar low a teenage girl with a record contract can step in and just feel like that's easy I can do that you made it too easy for everybody to step in the door and that's why you have this situation so if you don't like this fucking raise the bar higher stop being a baby stop crying stop being a baby it's not me in a Bobby because if you don't raise the standards higher you're going to have more bad babies you're gonna have more Jake Paul's and it's gonna get to a point where they're going to beat you out because honestly at the end of the day Danielle bergoglio or a Jay Paul are more marketable than you okay so they're taking your sound and they're more marketable than you because you know she's a bratty teenage girl and Jake Paul is a Disney kid okay like wake the fuck up seriously so raise the bar do it better improve evolve change the landscape on which they have to compete with you on you know change the sound do something new do something different because if you don't you're just gonna have a bunch of this shit which honestly in comparison with a lot of what is supposed to be you know real in this particular sound of this particular style she's not really doing it any worse you know it sounds really snobby it sounds really that's like you know really catty some of the verses are okay you know some of the bars are sort of funny you know some decently funny one-liners on here the cinematography on this thing is hilarious and immaculate I don't know what else you want guys you've set the bar too low and Danielle bergoglio is stepping in because you've made it too easy all right so does that single a bit that's saying it was kind of fun and I like the new bass track over here it's been a while since we've heard from bats unfortunately I don't know I don't know why it's taken this long but this is a cool little fun bit of art pop mixed with beat music you know definitely not the sound that he was indulging in on his past couple of Records but it has been a while so it's it's taken him a bit to sort of evolve to this point I guess and yeah you know it's it's a nice little alternative pop ballad some quirky production here the vocals did rub me the wrong way a bit but in the context of an entire album his very strange and you know somewhat left-field vocal style could grow on me for sure but again that bath song yet yeoman yeoman definitely hit that up down in the description all right here are the tracks that I thought were the best tracks got to give a shout out to the best tracks new screaming females track over here via Don Giovanni records big shout out to Don Giovanni they always drop some decent stuff and this track is titled black moon and this is a bit of a change of pace for the scree males it's really kind of the vocal harmonies and driving guitars and not so much punky but much more like anthemic rock style that the band is going for here but they still kind of bring that throttling driving energy that you expect from a screen Al's track it's pretty good so uh you know definitely liking the fact that you know they still play their instruments with a lot of guts the songwriting style here seems to have matured a little bit more and again those vocal harmonies they're great and they really kind of sell the track a new Rhapsody track over here it is from her new album which I am going to be reviewing very soon so don't want to talk too much about this track but I do want to give a huge nod and endorse it and make you guys aware of the fact that Rhapsody does have a new album out this track that is linked down there below is titled power it features Kendrick Lamar and Lance Skywalker apparently she got the two-for-one Top Dawg entertainment deal on this track with the features and yeah this is a really great track it's one of the highlights from the album for me and I am going to be reviewing it very soon it's really really good guys do not miss this one do not let this album slip through the cracks for you it is a great record it is definitely one of the better rap records I've heard this year so I'm kind of spoiling my opinion a bit early here but I do want to make you guys well aware because I feel like this album could be getting more hype and I feel like to only just praise this album in a review and in a review only would not be enough I want to hype it a little bit more in the best tracks over here and tell you guys this is a great record already great album give it a listen one of the better rap albums of the year this new track over here Metro boomin featuring Travis Scott titled blue pill this to me is one of the better tracks that I've heard from Metro boomin and Travis Scott in a while like it is the really Spacey intoxicating sexy and super catchy vibe that I enjoyed so much from rodeo but sort of encapsulated in this one non-album single I hope it ends up on an album or a tape somewhere especially if it were to end up on a Travis Scott project I do think it is a fantastic track and I would like to see Travis Scott go back in this direction a little bit more you know the structure on this track is interesting the melody is sticky instantaneously the production is great Travis Scott's a vocal performance is good like so many good things about this track it's a shame that it's just kind of a song that seems to be just haphazardly thrown out there hopefully it sort of finds a home on a larger project later and is indicative of some kind of direction for one or both of these artists going forward but yeah this is a really great track you know one of those deep dark murky trap ballads that are really soulful and a very very very demonic almost in a way and speaking of demonic shout out to Marilyn Manson who has a new track out titled kill for me new album on the way very soon link this track down there in the description along with all these other tracks but you know specifically this song I want to mention because I do think it is great really good tune not as obnoxious or underwhelming in points as his last single really kind of straightforward alternative metal ballad you know a few industrial elements here and there but that's kind of it very raw very energetic Manson's lyrical game i think is back on point his vocal performance game is you know really back on point as well sort of feels like I'm listening to you know old school Manson not with that you know but but sort of a sans a lot of the bells and whistles that maybe made his 90s and early 2000s of material fun but you know all the same good performance good recording good tune all around from Manson here let's move on injury reserve they have a new track out from their forthcoming project drive it like it's stolen this new track over here is much more of a catchy track much more of a banger goddammit Austin stop freaking texted me do I'm doing this my phones over there now injury reserve a new track out drive it like it's stolen project on the way the track is titled see you sweat now this is not these somewhat somber and low-key track that they decided to lead off with you know it's kind of an interesting way to tease toward an album with your first single or your first you know album or mixtape but with your first single you know being as low-key as it was however it was a very well shot video and the verses on that track where we're very personal we were very sad this new song over here also low-key in a sense but it's kind of one of those dark sensual and very sexy pop rap tracks with a good danceable beat the production is so so so so so Neptunes influenced like there is a huge Pharrell vibe on this track and it's a vibe it's a sound it's a style they pull off very well the verses are super smooth though I wouldn't say that that the vocals really kind of jump off of the page do they jump off the beat not necessarily but it's really because they're kind of playing as super cool on this track I think with multiple listens it's really kind of when this song wow me it sort of slowly pulls you in it's not so much one of these tracks that just jumps out of you at first it's kind of one of these smooth danceable cooled laid back and kind of cerebral rap songs that you know I think works what makes it work is a little bit more in secret than it is obvious I guess so I definitely do not miss this track I did love it I want to give a shout out to the new blue ghost song I don't want to say too much about it because I am gonna be reviewing this project very soon but still I wanted to point you guys to another piece of music from igloo ghost solar blade this guy is one of the most insane producers out right now continuing to love what he does next Hobson the purge believe it or not I do think the new Hobson song is dope it is dope as fuck now granted it is a little hypocritical because I feel like he kind of was making fun of this sound in this style on his last album and now he's sort of embracing it a bit on this new single over here granted though he is doing it on his own terms and this is not one of those songs from Hobson where he's trying to preach to you too much he's trying to shove a bunch of bullshit down your throat he's not trying to convert you to anything it's just you know one of these lyrically deadly nasty aggressive tracks with a good instrumental very catchy hook with kind of a gang chorus that's like really pumping and really exciting listen I know that we think Hobson is corny and most of the time he is I do think some of his early work that he broke with was pretty decent but overall you know a guy whose music generally is very hard to listen to and hard not to laugh at and I'm not anticipating that his next record is going to be like a classic or anything like that however I do have to give credit where it's due and I do have to say I do think this new song is great I think the flows are really tight I think the the beat and I think just the rhythm of the track is fantastic and lyrically I think the song is kind of funny you know and he drops a lot of deadly cutting lines without having to uh you know force an ideology onto his fan base you know maybe into the future he'll be a little bit smarter with how he chooses his words and makes his points and tries to make deeper tracks and sort of actually reaches a point of true emotional depth but you know until that point I'm ready to just say this song is decent the song is good I'm enjoying this track enjoying this new single from cold cave as well titled glory linked down there in the description it's you know pretty typical for the gothy synth-pop outfit although I will say that this song has a somewhat eerie new order esque New Wave vibe to it a little bit more than usual for them and it is a very pleasant and a very sweet you know synth pop tune and got to give a shout out to exploding and sound records for releasing a great single from this band a new album on the way big heat on a wire and the song over here is titled Flint that I wanted to point you guys to and it's a very wordy linear art punk song with bustling instrumentation just really intense vocal performance that I thought was really great and that's pretty much it guys those are the best tracks that I wanted to shout out to you guys the big heath cold cave the new Hobson track miraculously that I liked igloo ghost injury reserve marilyn manson trapped scotty and metro boomin rhapsody check at that album out do not miss that album scream ales and again those are the best I wanted to shout out again hit up that turntable at the turntable lab linked down

ZWjmQ-6OcSI,lalala hi everyone hahahahaha Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Foo Fighters album concrete & Gold chart dominating Seattle Washington rock outfit Foo Fighters they're back new album you know the band fronted by multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter Dave Grohl the band has a reputation that precedes itself and it's not hard to see why I mean they have so many radio rock hits under their belts at this point it's kind of impossible to deny Foo Fighters long-term viability and their knack for writing some of rock's greatest crossover singles however in my opinion the band's latest leg of their discography has just kind of been so so it did start off strong in 2011 with the album wasting light which in a decade where Rock is kind of trailing off in terms of relevancy Foo Fighters put out what is arguably one of their best albums from the speedy exciting and throttling white limo to the groovy punctuated and very sharp rope and there are some pretty passionate ballads on here I mean the song walk being the best of them I'm not a huge Foo Fighters fan the band is generally a little mild for my taste but even I could admit this album had its strong points and at the time I think I might have underrated it just a tad unfortunately the band followed this record up with the very bloated and uninspired sonic highways a record that was kind of disjointed and mostly seemed infatuated with the HBO series that informed its multi studio recording concept laying down tracks for each song in a different location which didn't exactly lead to the sense of adventure that it implies I mean it's easily the blandest crop of Foo Fighter songs yet so I went into this new album over here kind of hoping for some sort of redemption which could have easily happened given two very explosive and epic singles in the lead-up to this thing run and the sky is a neighborhood which impressed me much more in the context of the album than they did while attached to their very visually obnoxious music videos the song run features numerous smart fluid changes a sparkling dramatic introduction which eventually gives way to this incredible groove - back to back - but tuba some thunderous heavy guitars harsh lead vocals which eventually kind of breaks down slow down into this course that is almost like slow-mo in comparison the instrumental layers at this passage in the song are like sprawling and gorgeous this is easily one of the most insane and dynamic song as the band has ever thrown together the song sky is a neighborhood is a really passionate slow burner with an infectious man refrain the hook on this thing is so heavy it's so dense it's so bluesy there's also like a rush of strings popping in here and there in the song to support the rhythm instrumentation that sound great the song has an awesome instrumental ascension too as it plods along it just gets heavier and more powerful this track is just like the sound of slowly floating I also kind of like the raw feeling of the recording as well especially on Dave's vocals where you're just kind of getting a lot of ambient noise around his singing although this more raw approach to production doesn't necessarily benefit every track here I do think it's slightly kneecaps a few of the album's better tracks like on the song la-di-da where the vocals feel almost kind of lost or in competition with the very chaotic instrumental that swallows them a bit which is kind of a shame because I do enjoy the political theme of this track and some of the others on this album like the song happy-ever-after which is very pretty acoustic cut whose lyrics I think could be interpreted as a comment on the world at large or even the state of music today but to go back to the song la-dee-da there are a few interesting lyrical nods on this track to some pretty experimental of controversial bands like psychic TV and white house and death in June who says Dave Grohl isn't the musician's musician but on this la-dee-da track the guitars and drums sound like something out of like a Led Zeppelin song but without the musical virtuosity or flash to really carry the track or make it exciting from front to back so at one point in the song like in the last third of the track the band just kind of throttles through the track like punk style which admittedly kind of saves the song the line though in my opinion is another song that I think the mixing could have just been a touch better the vocals do feel so subdued on some points during the verse despite the fact that the tune sounds like it has real single potential the sound of the song overall just is not bright enough to really make the track pop to make a comparison this is definitely not as gratifying as some of the storytelling on the song Aeros where Dave tributes a lost friend with a very painful set of lyrics set to some driving but very dark guitar chords and the emotional pain on this track is is one of those things that just kind of builds up to this really high aggressive tension point that makes for one of the album's most moving moments now there are some tracks on here that for the most part I'm just underwhelmed by them for whatever reason like the song make it right the hook on this thing just feels obnoxious to me the rock guitar lead and riff that most of the song is kind of rooted in is just a little run-of-the-mill and then there are some ballads on here that are loaded in packed with these overwrought vocal harmony passages which seem kind of beetles esque and I don't know how the band sort of saw the power that they did in these vocal passages because I just do not think they pan out very well on this album their execution is merely okay and I feel like going down this road causes the the group to perform and write in such a way where the the music is just not really that exciting or engaging like on the track dirty water or the closing cut which feels like one of the longest songs on this thing it's just like this big huge overly dramatic nothing it's one of the most unsatisfying songs on the entire record it's so syrupy and boring and speaking of the Beatles the Foo Fighters also make the grave mistake of letting the drummer sing on the song Sunday rain which not only is underwhelming from a vocal standpoint because I'm sorry but Taylor Hawkins is not as entertaining a vocalist as Dave Grohl and this track is easily one of the most forgettable songs the band has ever recorded overall though I will say this album is a pretty decent record it's a slight bounce back from sonic highways it has a pretty consistently raw aesthetic some good tunes here and there but it's certainly not the high-water mark that wasting light was which again maybe if I had been more of a pop Toomas back in 2011 I would have saw more of the beauty of that album but unfortunately this new record over here for me is is just kind of falling short I'm feeling a like a decent 6 on this thing transition have you given the album a listen did you love it did you Kate it what would your a to hear the best you're the best which would I

NOvcBmZCRJ8,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd doing a quickie review here of the new murica album the second full-length album out of this project spearheaded by singer and songwriter Amelie Brun of ex-cops Fame she's been in other musical projects before that war has sort of toyed and other sounds outside of the black metal world which is where you're sort of lives and I was kind of surprised to hear another album out of this project despite the fact that there was so much hype and so much support leading up to the release of the debut EP and debut album out of this project much of the black metal community was very negative toward this record because Amelie doesn't have this legendary storied past in the black metal world she's sort of entering the genre entering the sound merely as an admirer of the style and the aesthetic which honestly like you know I think there's more to black metal than just kind of being being cult but that's just me sort of commenting as an outsider I'm sure you know that that guy who runs that angry YouTube black metal channel will have something to say about that shout out to that guy this new album over here it's not quite as disappointing as the debut was and honestly there there were more flaws to that record much more than just whether homily was truly a black metal artist or not like so much of the material on that record felt undercooked underdeveloped not that well mixed not that well written which was so surprising again given all the hype leading up to that album but also considering just how much musical support she had from some pretty like big names in the black metal community you would think that for them to slap their name on this thing that the music and the product overall just would have been a little bit better instead it was just kind of like shamelessly underdone now this new record over here in my opinion is tad longer and actually feels like a finished product like the songs are pretty well developed there's a great amount of musical and stylistic diversity across the album like there are some decent throttling fiery passion of black tracts on this thing and then there are a lot of tracks that kind of balance those out with almost like a gothic Foulke or a neo folk or a Nordic folk or kind of like this neoclassical goth vibe or something and a lot of these tracks are very pretty they are very vast they're very epic they're very grand and dramatic they feel almost kind of archaic and again they provide a nice counterbalance and just some interesting sounds and ideas to play off of the more black metal and the heavier tracks and the tracklisting like there's a good flow to these songs which is definitely something that the last album didn't have now is the writing all that fantastic I mean in my opinion it's still okay but these songs do actually feel well developed and are logically being built from finish to and and don't have these sudden you know endings or don't just sort of throw random ideas at you to sort of transition for the sake of transitioning because Amelie or whoever she was working with didn't have enough ideas sort of logically carry out a particular segment of a song and actually create a great segue or bring it to a more sensible conclusion like the tracks on here feel much more sensible overall in terms of composition they don't feel as erratic which is certainly a good thing but I'm not really wowed or impressed with her as a writer or as a vocalist like certainly there are good fundamentals on this record but I'm not like blown away by a lot of the material I'm not blown away by a lot of the substance and it's it's certainly debatable as to whether or not a lot of the gothic and neo folk and almost New Age moments on the album are really my kind of cup of tea but if those genres really sort of tickle your fancy and you know you you want to hear somebody sort of blend those with more metal aesthetics then certainly you know this record is certainly worth checking out I haven't heard a lot of artists sort of combine these sounds a particular way that Muller has here I guess I'm just sort of at a bit of a loss with the writing and sometimes the execution as well because the vocal performances to me are very cold on this thing occasionally like they don't ring out to me as being all that exciting and it was even a moment on the song crown where I'm Elise singing almost struck me as like Lana Del Rey esque in a way there's a couple of Chelsea wolf features on here as well and those are actually pretty fantastic it's wonderful to hear her on this record and you know potentially getting some crossover Fame off of this because them coming together for a project really actually does kind of make sense like probably very similar fan bases and similar styles as well but uh outside of that you know a lot of this record is just merely okay in my opinion but I could see other people liking us so much more than me which is why I kind of wanted to put some focused attention on it here in this review I'm not nutty about it but certainly I would recommend it to metal fans that are into the funkier side of the draw of the genre or are you know potentially looking for something in the black metal realm but is a little bit easier to get into isn't quite as I guess antisocial and willing to push Outsiders away potentially from here now that there's certainly a good amount of fundamentals on this album there's reason at least for me to look forward to the future because if Amelie continues she could build on top of this into a sound that is a little bit more original and ambitious and that's essentially what I'm looking forward to from here so uh you know I like this record overall it's it's not bad but certainly not blowing me away or anything like that let me know what you thought of this album down in the comments did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next click on the link next to my head of the review that I did for the past miracle record or click on the link to subscribe to the channel I'll see you guys in the next one forever 
bdiGlNbz_Qc,ah hi everyone kill you here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new open mike eagle album brick body kids still daydream this is the latest full-length album from our trap Renaissance man mr. open mike eagle and i haven't talked about open mike eagles origins that deeply in the past but i have to mention here for the narrative of this album that he has some pretty deep roots in chicago he originally grew up in the Robert Taylor homes which was a set of projects on the Windy city's south side they were demolished ten years ago mike has some feelings on this and he essentially takes this as an opportunity to wax poetic on the memories that he had there using those as kind of a springboard to explore themes of home displacement change gentrification resilience Mike's trademark sense of humor isn't that present on this new record over here not as much as it has been on projects like rappers will die of natural causes or dark comedy or he'll a personal film festival but that kind of gets swapped out effectively for Mike Eagle at his most personal on any album he's ever recorded ever not to mention though that his wit his vast Cabul Airy his quirky references his wordplay those are all still present here one more thing to note though is that this album is pretty low-key and we're talking low-key for open mike eagle like he's not exactly one of these soundcloud rapper dudes screaming ad-libs at the top of his lungs even the bangers on here feel somewhat measured and heady because each song has a pretty strong topic or idea or narrative component to it even on TL DR which features a very over-the-top vocal delivery from open mike eagle and a very relentless aggressive flow but the lyrics and kind of the tone of the track read like a really long-winded angry internet post just thrown up there in all caps or the song no selling where open is also just a little bit more aggressive than he has on many of the other tracks here as he wraps him out for bar after bar after bar not letting the pain that is being thrown at him by his enemies and my life show on his face yet there is a big contrast here because on the very next track happy wasteland day open mike eagle just throws up all these lyrics essentially about the insanity of the modern day becoming normalized through our politics through our culture I mean the hook on this thing is essentially open mike eagle begging for a day where he can go without sirens or fear or violence etc so there are numerous tracks on this thing we're open mike eagle is hitting listeners with the harsh realities of modern times but then there are moments on here we're open mike almost shelters listeners and warms them by bringing them back to his past to those housing projects where maybe for him things fell simpler easier like they made more sense like on the track 95 radios which is easily one of the most endearing rap songs I've heard this decade I love the very chilly and cute chord progression and keyboards Mike's very earnest singing voice try to find a radio like if this song just had louder and bolder percussion and was being performed by you know some chart-topper it could easily be a pop hit I also love the quaint and funny descriptions that might makes to the lengths that he would go to to find a radio and he was younger and the lyrics are essentially just a lot of warm memories about his old stomping grounds old friends music we also have the equally endearing daydreaming in the projects which is pretty much a tribute to kids all around the world growing up in places like Mike did when he was young at least that's the sentiment the hook brings on this track the verses for the most part are kind of Mike musing about various experiences in his life both past and present the whole record kind of comes to a head on the final track my auntie's building its criminally short but very much wraps up the inspiration for the album with Mike Eagle expressing his raw frustration for the fact that these buildings had been demolished being angry at the fact that he kind of lost a piece of his past with that not only that but how many family's lives had changed there's a very eerie and beautiful refrain that kind of plays the track out but I wish the song was just another verse or two longer just to really kind of bring home the sentiment of the record now the production on this thing it's kind of ragtag but in a good way there's a subtly lo-fi kind of quality to it it's got a cool tattered aesthetic to it though occasionally it does work against the album on a few songs that do feel a little muddy or toothless like on the song hymnal I do like the sentiment and the guest verse on that track quite a bit but a lot of the time it seems like open mikes vocals are kind of competing with these sweeping glitchy kind of experimental synth passages on that cut and as much as I like some of the lyrics on wedding ghosts that song as well does feel just a little middle-of-the-road as far as just the impact of the sound not only that but the track overall sort of lacks a defined sense of direction and there are a few songs on here like the outro that I do wish we're just a tad longer or just kind of worked a little bit more to fully illustrate their point like a breezeway ritual but outside of that the songs and the instrumentals on this thing are really captivating and some of Mike's best work yet the dreamy and hypnotic instrumental on how could anybody feel a home is fantastic the constant tapping the Warped and almost mind-altering woodwind melodies on this thing the grimy off-kilter beat and cycling noise on no selling is invigorating the track almost sounds industrial and features some very round fat bass I love how lazy and deflated the instrumental is unhappy wasteland day it sort of reflects just the the drained feeling of just being warned out by all this craziness that open-mike sort of throws on with a song the jazzy horns that pop up very faintly on the hook of the song daydreaming is one of the prettiest musical touches on the entire record and the song brick body complex has this wonderful growing swelling intensity to it that kind of mood grows and grows and grows and grows it's like open my Eagle is charging his laser again despite a few tracks that just did not have a lot of bite or just lacked a little bit in terms of length this album is not only fantastic in terms of just its substance and its content the quality of each individual track but what it's trying to say overall as a concept and a theme Mike's amateurish singing voice is still very much an acquired taste but a taste that I'm very much comfortable with up until this point I think there's an earnestness to his delivery that's very nice and whatever the man's vocal faults are you can't deny his sense of melody and I also like how on this album he sort of weaves into singing and rapping in such a way where it's almost like he's blurring the lines a little bit not that that isn't already being done at an insane pace in the mainstream right now but it's just cool to see open mike eagle progressing in that direction as an artist I think this album might be a little tough for a newcomer just because again of how low-key it is at moments but honestly I think this is one of Mike's most cohesive and emotionally potent albums yet and I'm feeling a very strong and beefy eight on this thing transition have you given this open mike eagle album a listen did you love it what would you rate

n8_qk3FrFjM,well hello there how are you Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busy as visitor and it's time for review of the new Daniel Caesar album Freudian what took you so long dum-dum I've been telling you to listen to this freaking album for like 10 years now I've been telling you and telling you and telling you and telling you you just don't listen I've been telling you for weeks and weeks weeks listen to the Danny sitar listen to daddy Sassari you won't even do it I'm just asking you every freaking day it's like you're not even like a alright okay this is the debut full-length album from singer and songwriter Daniel Caesar whose fans have been drowning me with requests to review this album since it dropped in August and I swear I was planning on listening to it I just been getting distracted I've had a lot going on that's all and once again I'm happy I'm in a position where I have thousands of people pushing me to try and recommend certain things to me because we have a nice kind of cyclical relationship going on here I review things and I recommend things to you guys you'd like them that you hear stuff you recommend it back to me sometimes I really end up enjoying those things and I think this is one of those instances this album is some really rich creamy smooth and classy R&B with some subtle gospel influences popping up here and there by way of some pretty nice chorus vocals the instrumentals on this thing are subtly funky and sensual more lazy and blissful than they are fiery and passionate the whole thing sounds like a lazy Sunday lying in bed in your underwear with your new girl who you just had a night of wild sex with last night which makes this album the perfect soundtrack for morning sex this record overall is very pleasant it's very pretty it's very feel-good doesn't really leave a mark though outside of some of the very steady and sharp bass and drum grooves on this thing and the hooks but we will get to that later now Daniels voice in my opinion it's not really the most expressive I've ever heard kind of reminds me in a way of a young Frank Ocean it has lots of potential certainly as good singing fundamentals but rarely does he sort of go above and beyond to really sell a song or deliver something in the way of like an original recipe which you could say is too much to expect from this point at Daniel I mean this is his first album all that he is released in terms of music I believe beyond this is like a couple of EPS but still that lack of adventure and that lack of vocal presence does sort of keep this album from being as exciting as it could be there are a few risky moments here and there like on the track loose where the instrumentation at one point turns kind of syrupy and beautifully surreal just before it breaks away into a lonely piano vocal passage generally on the 10 tracks that this album lasts Daniel and the instrumentals do play it pretty straight letting the true hero of this album really shine and that is the songwriting the song we find love is not only one of the better performed and better written tracks in the track listing here but the group vocal moment on the course is actually incredibly inspiring we also have the very blissful and hypnotic take me the lead melody on this chorus is easily one of the most alluring moments on the entire album it just really beckons for you and while the song best part featuring her is super quiet super subtle super intimate it's easily one of the most catchy songs on the record the quiet vocal harmonies aren't exactly fireworks but they do actually make for the best bit of vocal chemistry on the entire record and Daniel does have quite a few collaborators on this thing I don't know just the closeness of the vocals it's kind of like they're cheek to cheek they're swaying together there's sort of a musical yet physical intertwining Ninon intertwine character to the singing on this thing that i think really makes the track plus the endearing lyrics on here about you being the water when I'm stuck in the desert or you being the Tylenol when my head hurts and the song blessed is easily one of the most personal and captivating tracks on the entire project the rich and jazzy piano chords all over this thing the incredible sense of love and longing coming out of these lyrics I just wish Daniel sold it a little bit harder in the second half when the instrumentation gets so much louder but it seems like he doesn't bring up the energy level to kind of match it he gets a little flooded out by the instrumentation though I can't he's singing a bit harder he does lose the volume battle with the backing band now there are some moments where I feel like the songs here really failed to stick the landing a track may fizzle out or sort of transition somewhat quickly or awkwardly into another musical passage that allows the song to sort of evaporate from there like on new or dinero's Azure hold me down and there are at least several tracks here that for this genre of music feel kind of run-of-the-mill and average however my dude here brought back the secret track on the final song of this thing like it was 2001 the last song stops and then it goes on with like dead air for a few minutes and then a new track plays it's it's it's literally we're back on the secret track thank God I missed that thing I missed that thing so much overall I thought this was a very good album it's not a perfect record by far and I feel like daniel has a long way to go before he has a defined voice and a defined style hopefully he has more ambitious music coming down the pipe more fiery performances more spirited performances or you know taking it maybe even more subtle to find new ways of just creating or conjuring musical sensuality I could take either direction honestly what I can't take is him just hanging in this middle-of-the-road status when I feel like he has so much more potential to do something that is uniquely him I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best

Hlx4ONMtRFY,hey everyone I'm pretty much feeling like a lay 7 on new movie here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Ariel pink album dedicated to Bobby Jameson Ariel pink multi-instrumentalist songwriter and one of pop music's true eccentrics back with a new album of warped and nostalgic songs for the weird at heart ever since I heard Ariel's material in like the late 2000s I was floored I was instantly impressed with this dude songwriting chops but was especially impressed with his ability to create like this alternate musical reality merely through his approach to production like a lot of his recordings sound like long-lost artifacts from an alternate pop timeline that never happened with the sounds of disco and glam and funk and synth pop and punk surf rock and soul all melting together into a sort of psychedelic lo-fi soup and for one album after another doldrums mature themes house-arrest sworn copy before today his fantastic album he dropped a couple of years ago pomf pomf pomf pomf Ariel's most colourful and catchy set of tracks yet almost white album ish in just how dynamic and almost unpredictable the style and sound of the record is as far as the the flow of the track listing except it's all masterminded by one musical madman now Ariel's latest effort over here isn't quite the musical rainbow that pom-pom was nor is it as snappy Ariel consciously pulls fans back into the smooth Airy low fine murk that many of his early Haunted graffiti releases were caked in and it's kind of retrospective in a couple of different ways you have the general sense of nostalgia that usually radiates off of an aerial pink album and then on top of that it's almost like he's kind of going back to his old musical stomping grounds to revisit the past a little bit I mean even the track I want to be young on this record is a re-recorded version of a song that's been floating around since like the mid 2000s I'm not really disappointed with the idea of Ariel going back in a slightly low Phi direction I mean he has toyed with more hi-fi sounds in the past and the results haven't always been gold things being a bit dirtier a bit more low five for Ariel kind of makes sense obscurity and oddity are kind of he shines the most this is also where he finds his inspiration and figures like our Stevie Moore as well as the LA punk scene that the title track of this thing is supposed to be a nod to cleanliness of sound is not necessarily an improvement for areal pink because mystery is a huge thing that kind of makes him and clarity is is sort of the enemy to mystery in my opinion the sonic shadows are where Ariel has performed some of his greatest tricks over the years enhancing his sharp pop balladry with ghostly auditory illusions and funhouse style sound play and that's pretty much what he delivers here yet another very solid crop of songs paired with some pretty great and creative instrumentals I pretty much enjoy this thing one track after another the song feels like heaven is originally a cut that kind of underwhelm me with it's incredibly Spacey sound but the more I listen to it the more I realized this thing is a wonderful piece of dream pop the chorus is incredibly catchy and blissful and the sound isn't just reverb II I mean the atmosphere surrounding this thing is silky and smooth very envelope intoxicated the title track features all these quirky grooves and weird somewhat sour vocal harmonies that only get stranger as the song progresses some glossy synth leads work their way into the track and the song features one of my most favorite choruses on the entire record it has kind of a driving beat and fun sing-along kind of quality to the group vocals I found myself kind of mouthing along to it but because of how catchy it is of course I was curious as to what the lyrics are and once I looked it up yes of course this is what Ariel is singing on the hook he's not one to mince words the song time to live is a thunderous rock tune that's so dense it's so heavy it's incredibly thick for an Ariel song as the song sort of progresses and becomes more hypnotic and groovy and noisier we get this Volkl mantra just kind of marching in unison singing time to live and when the lead vocals of the first verse pop in melodies like a dead ringer for video killed the radio star but it's pretty awesome I can't believe how catchy the track is and yet how entangled and obtuse it feels the song another weekend is very somber but incredib we catch you at the same time very bittersweet and for a track this kind of easygoing in aesthetic it's truly a maze there are so many different segues and transitions and starts and stops so many incredibly engaging and smart change ups throughout the song and yet that whole another weekend that very trippy kind of laid-back psych pop chorus really shines through the song bubblegum dreams is a very fuzzy rapper that lives up to its bubblegum title it's a track that balances grungy distortion with hyper sweet pop rock and dreamdate narcissist is kind of like a little tongue-in-cheek tune of which there are usually a couple on an aerial pink album that that reads like he's essentially pulling a tune together about being the worst date ever of the few issues that I have with this LP one of them is that some of the tracks feel like they are a little bit more schtick than song which isn't entirely a problem for me because I do enjoy aerial pink stick but still there are a few tracks that sort of feel like these redundant micro motifs that have been patted out to a full song length not a lot in terms of progression sort of like the opener as much as I like the refrain and the mantra of time to the mage oh god I do wish you changed up a bit more along with Santa's in the closet between its redundant instrumental and Ariel Pink's very zany almost shoo shoo esque vocal delivery on this track it does leave a little to be desired I think the vocals on death Patrol could have had a bit more presence as well and the closing track acting is a pretty interesting finish because it features Dame funk an artist that has just as many unique qualities as Ariel pink does and I was pretty excited to hear these guys working together once again following the collaboration between Ariel and Dame that landed on Dame's latest record but the song is just a different version of the track that landed on Dame funks album acting and I was just as underwhelmed by this track as I was the other version of it on Dame's album but for totally different reasons I like the ritzy smooth synth funk instrumental on the track I like Dame's soloing and embellishments all over the song but Ariel Pink's vocals have just a very zeny sort of delivery to them top that with the fact that there's like a touch of auto-tune on them they get kind of grating to be honest and then there are a few cuts like kitchen which on this record that in my opinion are a little average for Ariel like I know the canvas he's placed himself in front of on this record is one that he is very comfortable with and familiar with but I feel like that's led him to play it a little safe and a little predictable on this LP at least more than I would have liked because honestly if these songs have been handed to me on like a Burt CD I would have just assumed they were like unreleased Ariel pink material from the mid to late 2000s which in one sense is a complaint but in another sense not really because that is kind of exactly when Ariel did put out some of his best stuff and to hear him put out another pretty great set of songs in that same vein is not really anything to whine about this album may in fact just end up entertaining hardcore fans and convert a few newbies here and there who might not have heard the old stuff yet I still think it's a really solid record and it does feature some of Ariel's best work so far I'm feeling a strong 7 to 8 feathery feathery eight on this thing transition have you given this album we'll listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it here the best you're the best or should I review next to the like if you like please subscribe and please don't die stay hydrated and eat your fruits and veggies please over here next to my head is another Ariel pink review please

OtC4THSrbQ8,hi everyone this new brain ep it's not good brain is supposed to be literally the brain or rather it's an alternate persona of rap game seth rogen little dickie who you might remember i didn't really care for his recently released project professional rapper in fact I thought it was one of the most long-winded cringy and unfunny records to come out in a long time and if you remember one of the most long-winded and obnoxious tracks on that entire project pillow talking little Dicky actually has a rap style back and forth with his brain and now that brain character has returned with an EP of his own of course little Dicky is featured on pretty much every track here even like the skit the brainstorming skit and yeah it's it's seven tracks is 20 minutes and it's pure hell how do you make an entire EP based around just your bad singing voice like this is how I would sing in the shower if I was trying to make myself laugh it don't sound good and is it supposed to be funny is it supposed to be funny is this funny I'm waiting for the joke cuz clearly there's a tone of you know comedy here like he clearly thinks what he's doing is funny or at least he thinks it's a bit tongue-in-cheek or you know a little cheeky because it's certainly not charismatic or charming or I guess kind of electrifying in the same way that most any other rappers music would be little Dicky just kind of inhabits this weirdly awkward middle lay in between these bata tendencies and mainstream rap manliness it's like wimpy college bro humor at its most potent what we're listening to is clearly as much a novelty act as the Lonely Island and yet we're treating it like it's competing with every other serious rapper out there but it's not like we haven't been here before like what we're hearing here isn't altogether different from like back in the day when Asher was rapping about like in college but at least that was listenable okay alright we're alright thank you thank you at least it's just in his regular bad singing voice you're really about to do a song here about how you haven't done cocaine I just don't I love how she's sniffing the Zeus and then he had to ad-lib coke because the song is about coke we know what you're referencing why why not do some meth it might just be like when you didn't want Brussels sprouts as a kid and now you like those not a big potato in my favorite calm potato number one mashed potatoes are better they are and number two I want to enjoy this thing but there's no point of view I can apply to it that would make it enjoyable do I take what he's saying seriously I can't because what he's saying is stupid do I take what he's saying as a joke I can't because I don't think it's funny and it's really corny in fact just as corny as any Hobson record except it doesn't come with a stupid ideology that he's trying to preach to you instead he's just kind of in a weirdly predatory way taking advantage of the fact that he knows that his audience has these tendencies of being a little wimpy they want to be in the crowd they want a party they want to have fun but they're not the Alpha I wish I could be a fly on the wall of a college dorm room inhabited by a little Dickey fan when he goes to uh Nayana CLE play some little Dickey for a girl that he has in there only only for her to turn around because you know somebody's gonna do that with this F slow song on here I feel like I'm listening to somebody who wants to be the center of attention and wants to be the class clown wants to be the funniest guy in the room but the only way that he knows to go about doing that is by delivering jokes that are all kind of at the expense of his own dignity hey I'm smashing eggs on my head and pulling down my pants and oh I pooped myself when really honestly like a song about being afraid to try cocaine a song about having an issue with girls fucking too fast on your dick it's just really pitiful there's more to being self-aware than consciously shooting yourself in the foot in front of a crowd of people and when they look at you and think wow that person's stupid you internally think to yourself yeah I knew it was stupid I knew you were gonna think I was stupid okay [Music] well I I feel like after hearing these vocals how can little dickie fans really sit here and act like he's got some kind of access to some sort of talent or he's like at some kind of execution level that no other artist is at or that he's like somehow gonna be steppin to the legend status of like a Tupac or a Kanye West at some point because imagine this scenario oh you kids all you listen today is trash you don't listen to any good music today back in my day we had real music listen to this for something titled after a brain it's pretty goddamn brainless also and if you could bring up the vision of this thing this character this this thing like the character design on this thing the CGI character design on this thing is hot garbage it looks like the mascot for some kind of I don't know memory enhancement pill that they might advertise during primetime on CNN like this little guy might walk out and try to sell you some ginkgo biloba this thing is unlikable on all levels the little crappy voice is crappy the lyrics are just wholesale corn balls and cheese balls like man the the corn ball cheese ball Emporium is having a liquidation sale and everything must go to corn balls and cheese balls 70% off 80% off 90% off okay all right okay all right okay oh that brainstorm skit is so crappy the game feature on the last track is pretty decent and I certainly admire the production quality and the instrumentals on this thing whoever was kind of behind that certainly had a lot of attention to detail and when you're talking about most mainstream rap today like once the instrumental is great or at least decent or at least trendy and on par with much of everything else that's out there in the field more than half the battle is won like 70% of the battle is won but this whole foundation is just being built to support just a really awful joke and I'm not really sure what to say about it beyond that I mean listen maybe I'm not one to talk I have had my history with a really bad alternate persona but Jesus Christ this was hard to listen to this was hard to sit through this is hard to even continue thinking of so I'm just going to end it right there this new brain EP it's not good position have you given this EP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I

odQcHCsW2YA,it's like the fall white why is it hot and humid again stop so this is right now stop being hot here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new national album sleep well beast the National is an Indian art rock band nearing almost two decades of music so good for them on that however that doesn't really change the fact that going into this album I wasn't really all that excited it's no secret that the band's last record Trouble will find me kind of rubbed me the wrong way which to me is personally disappointing not only because I think a lot of their older work is quite good but also there are a lot of characteristics to the national sound that I feel naturally I should just like and take to their sleek style their mature songwriting frontman Matt Berninger very deep crooning vocal style also the band's very subtle post-punk influences sometimes the band's music can feel a little gray and lifeless lacking in anything in terms of a pulse or excitement but this new album over here brings a nice change of pace it's a pleasant surprise muah-muah not saying the national have all of a sudden become this loud bold off-the-wall band oh man they're pulling out all the stops this this album's fireworks no that's not the case on this new record however the National don't seem quite as listless on this album the instrumentation sounds a lot fuller more detailed more vibrant it's not really skeletal or super empty like the last record or kind of washed out and a tad too much reverb as it was in my opinion on hi violet sleep well beast is a very tangible album both musically and lyrically I don't just feel like I'm listening to some kind of soundtrack of musical pastiche for a white guy sulking in his high-rise apartment that he rented in a freshly gentrified neighborhood as he is getting dressed and ready to go out and get drunk at his favorite overpriced wine bar not to say that that isn't an accurate description of this album to a degree but sleep well beast isn't just that Matt's vocals on this thing are a lot closer a lot more intimate which i think makes the sorrowful demeanor of his singing that much more potent the tracklist on this thing is a really broken up into moody dirges and propulsive rockers this thing is calm its meditative its downhearted but beautiful as well and kind of numbing the very still sad and lonely ballad no one else will be there starts the album off pretty nicely the song is very subtle almost has an ambient vibe it kind of lulls me into a trance that the following track day I die smashes into pieces with its screaming guitar leads and driving Tom rhythms not to mention that melodically I think this is one of the most anthemic tracks the National has dropped since like boxer following this we have the hypnotizing walk it back which that's a very cerebral pace it kind of locks me into place as I slowly soak in the utterly defeated vibe of Matt singing and lyrics and there are more electrifying highlights to come down the tracklisting like the system only dreams in total darkness and turtleneck both of which hit some very passionate highs I mean especially turtleneck like the drums and guitars on that track are almost thunderous and for whatever reason as Matt picks up the intensity in his vocals and the band really starts roaring their music almost becomes like like a bit of a dead ringer for some late air and Nick cave but without going full rip off like it's kind of tasteful and very flattering and I think exposes a very essential and very nice major influence for the band it's also cool to hear the band incorporating more electronics into their repertoire as well on this album and to hear those electronics get infused into their typical style so well it brings so much extra color a new kind of snappiness to their style and the tambour and tone of the percussion and the synthesizers kind of have that same cool slick laid back but moody vibe that their drums and guitars and vocals typically do highlights like I'll still destroy you and guilty party the latter of which features this haunting lullaby style melody coming from Matt's vocals that despite its subtlety to me was one of the stickiest moments on the entire record that and just the heart-wrenching tale told in the lyrics however I wouldn't say this record is just all glory from front to back while it is just a tad longer than the band's previous material it's it's a little long-winded especially when considering just how slow and dreary the national sound typically is and there are some songs where I feel like the instrumental build or the songwriting itself is just kind of off like the quietly puttering electronics and sad-sack piano chords on born to beg that I think leave a lot to be desired especially considering that Matt singing atop this instrumentation just kind of mutters his way sadly through the entire song this is probably a moment when any other frontman would really sell the track but that's just really that's not Matt then we have Empire line which in my opinion is almost as underwhelming and redundant if not for the slight instrumental crescendo toward the very end of the track that isn't even really that gratifying and the last several tracks of the album does not leave the record with a strong finish in fact it is pretty much the most forgettable material on the entire project from Karen at the liquor store which almost ends out of nowhere to the title track which isn't really interesting enough to justify its six minute runtime as it's mostly packed with quirky instrumental filler orbiting around the groove the band set earlier in the song but for national fans this is probably exactly what you're expecting or even wanting from the band at this point in their career I don't know take my critiques of the National with a grain of salt because at this point in their career a lot more people seem to be crazier about them than me but still even I can see that the band has grown and improved vastly over their last couple of albums even if those were very well received to the band's performances and songwriting seem a little bit more engaging the production is clearer and more vibrant more punchy more balanced as well each piece of instrumentation has a very distinct flavor and place in the mix and this is the first time in a long time when the band's music has truly been emotionally stirring and relatable even if their shtick is still kind of glazed over in a first world problem malaise I'm feeling a light decent 7 on this album Treach or treacherous for a transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I

channel and they support these segments alright let's get right into the weekly track roundup here it is now the weekly track roundup every episode of the roundup prior with this title card has said week II track roundup so now the L is in there it's new and improved that's that's what we do here we're professional when we run into problems like this we fix them weeks and weeks and weeks later also want to remind you guys down in the description box I'm going on tour in October linked to tickets for all the dates down there again in the description box I'm doing west coast states and doing East Coast states tickets are selling pretty decent so far so they are gonna be cheaper before you buy at the door as well just kind of let you know we have an Amazon Associates link down there if you're gonna buy on a if you're gonna buy something on Amazon click on that link if you live in the US again if you live in the US if you live in the u.s. click on the link brings you to the home page anything you buy after that we get kickback from it does not add to the overall price and we have a similar thing going on the good people over at turntable lab where you can buy some colorful pressings of Records that I've reviewed on the channel or turn table stuff or speakers you know audiophile stuff for the budding record collector in your life or yourself and here we go here the worst with no further ado all right let's let's see what's here we got here a new killer song new killer song you know honestly I was pretty hype on the tracks that have been released from this album thus far but this new track over here Jesus Christ it's titled some kind of love and it is the most saccharine gross and like completely stomach-churning love song that I have heard in a while and it's definitely not gonna be a song that I'm looking forward to hearing again once I actually listen to this album in full you know even if I end up doing that because this is this song honestly has kind of turned me off of the idea a little bit but let's let's move on from there because this track generally I feel is kind of gross next worst song of the week in my humble opinion is this new track from the horrors titled weighted down which is kind of surprising because every single track have heard from this new horrors album so far and possibly this album could grow on me this track had grown me a little bit once I hear in the context of the entire album but this is like the most ungratified song I've heard from the horrors in a long time to just cut it just kind of seems like to be this long-winded abstract weird somewhat noisy rock track that never quite resolves or builds up into anything it's just really obtuse Andrew and for no reason whatsoever there's not really an interesting sound to the song there's not really an interesting structure to the song it just kind of feels like when I'm continually listening to something that is teasing toward getting something going but yet it never really happens again really not gratifying the most unsatisfying single from this new album so far but the track so far have been so weird and left a field and have a kind of alternative dance vibe that I still am mildly curious as to what they're gonna pull through on this record it's it seems like it's building up to be their weirdest release yet so still I am kind of curious and finally this new destroyer song unfortunately I did not care for at all gentle town swimming in blood the throbbing electronics on here and Dan Behar's general lack of interesting lyrics and his very mild vocal delivery on this track in my opinion make this one of the most lifeless singles destroyer has ever released which is kind of disappointing because this is like I don't know the destroyer is typically really in my wheelhouse like I'm very much taken in by Dan's charms most of the time and that is just not the case this time around unfortunately the music was just really lacking and it doesn't help that the music video just seems really thrown together but let's move on to the tracks that I thought were man definitely worth a nod but did not win me over anything like that first new Weezer song it's it's titled Beach Boys I don't know man it just has some really sugary production I mean the hook is kind of sharp but it sounds like I'm listening to the sort of instrumentation that would have landed on the first Foster the People album or something it's just got no bite whatsoever it just seems like a little - I don't know dolled up to be a Weezer song even though their sound is typically pretty slick but it just seems a little too I don't know light-hearted I guess - to actually like you know make an impact in my opinion Marilyn Manson has a new single out which the verses I think could have used a little work like there could have been a better melody there could have been a bit more tension just kind of keep the track interesting during the verse portions of the song but overall I like his vocal performance on this thing I like the production on this thing it seems to go back to that really raw industrial rock sound that I enjoyed so much on releases such as Antichrist Superstar it feels like he's really kind of taking it back to basics a little bit on this thing and in a good way I think over his past couple of releases he has been slowly kind of improving you know almost like breaking things down to like okay let's totally just knock the whole thing over go to square one and this to me so far sounds like another step in the progression and the chorus is fantastic it's it's a it's a it's a burning searing fiery chorus that you you know again it kind of takes me back to some of the high points early on in his career so while I don't think the song is perfect it does kind of have my mouth watering does have me excited for what he's gonna be doing on this new album dropping this year so new Marilyn Manson album this year keep your eyes out keep your ears open bitch moving on from there max a verse can has a new song out you know typical washed-out sort of tweeze or t'v noise pop kind of thing from these guys you know nothing altogether new from Mac the a verse can but you know it's actually not that bad of a track it's kind of a decent ballad it's you know got a nice sort of vibe and tune to it you know I mean for people who sort of like that style there's a lot of good stuff about this track you know just in my opinion I feel like the band is kind of uh lost a little bit of the edge that kind of made them stand out in the first place you know what I mean but maybe with this new record they'll kind of grab it back EBE I know I'm not saying that correctly I'm just breaking everybody's balls they have a new track out which is titled I got to get the title right over here because I don't want to mispronounce this because it is in Spanish this title song is titled me voy and features a singer who I'm not fully aware of prior to this track anyway named mala Rodriguez and it's not a bad song you know definitely not as fantastic as the track they just dropped with Kumasi Washington but it seems like they're dabbling in a bit of auto-tune reggaeton on this track it's got a nice beat it's got a nice groove the auto-tune is a little heavy-handed on the song but I do like the melody of the track I do think the vocal performances are very nice you know they definitely still stand out to me as one of the more unique pop groups out there right now so still very much looking forward to this album and kind of the plethora of just international influences they sort of bring to the table and sort of look looking forward to hearing them kind of play out across an entire tracklist on this forthcoming record Gucci Mane new song curve weekend it's okay you know I mean it's it's kind of typical for both of them at this point able dominates a lot of the song so uh and it's it's almost like Gucci Mane is featured on the track you know to be honest because like able the weekend really takes over a majority of the track and it's very smooth it's very moody Gucci's performance is fine you know it's it's not blown me away or anything but you know just seems kind of formulaic and predictable at this point to be quite honest and finally in this section I will give a shout out to the new burial track rodent I don't know it just kind of seems like a little bit of running run-of-the-mill skeletal very average dubstep that you know you would have caught like in the late you know 2000s or like 2010 or 2011 or something burial to me is on this recent material that has been dropping via Bandcamp and hyper dub just not really I don't know wowing me or anything does not seem to be as experimental or as explorative as some of his best work I'm just wondering if that same drive to do something different and be a trailblazer and be a pioneer is still sort of there you know or if that's just something he happened to be doing and now he's just kind of staying part of the course because this is just the sound he always wanted to play with and now it's just not as revolutionary as it was a handful of years ago when he was putting out some of his best stuff but even this track along with you know some other new material is not as long and as epic and as multifaceted as you know some of his best work so it's like there's clearly like an ambition level in the older stuff that is not showing up in the newer stuff while you know rodent is fine there are some cool vocal samples on this thing the beat is certainly cool you know it just seems a little tepid in my opinion and that will bring us to the tracks that I thought were the best songs of the week track side needed needed needed to point out tracks that it was really excited by this week new track out from timber timber sort of seems to be like a b-side or a non-album track don't quote me on that could be totally wrong on that I don't want to you know look like a total dum-dum you know educate me educate my ass but it's a new track title les Oh boots which I'm probably now saying right because I don't speak no French but here we go it kind of brings back the Moody noir sort of strung out very dark very dreary sound that made timber tambour so special and so exciting in the first place like this is not the weird new wavy synthy dark wavy sort of off-kilter sound that they delivered on their last album this to me plays to the strengths that you know the the the band had on hot dreams and on their previous album as well but without entirely just kind of rehashing everything from those albums listen I'm not exactly sure what happened on the light on the latest timber tambour album it it's just kind of a mess you know to be completely honest I did not care for it really at all and I'm just kind of hoping the band I don't know sort of sort of sees the album as a detour and sort of finds the ability to build on what they have been sort of progressing towards so far you know rather than kind of veering off in the direction that they had set with their latest project new single with 21 savage by post Malone this song is titled rock star and it's actually not like a bad single like Malone's vocals on the track don't sound bad the vocal melody is really sticking and haunting and kind of Moody the beat hits hard but kind of still has that sad spacey trap vibe 21 savage sounds you know quiet but mean on the track there are a lot of good things about this single and you know looking forward to seeing what post Mullins gonna do on this new album over here because it sort of seems like he has you know grown a bit since his last record and you know could potentially be I guess kind of maturing as an artist a little bit on this thing now I'm not saying that this track is deep or anything like that but it certainly sounds a little bit more well put together and a bit more sure of itself and sure of its sound and sure of its style then you know a lot of the weird trap ballad acoustic guitar fusions that I really did not care for at all on his debut new track from Miriam the believer of you know wild birds and peace drums Fame she has another solo record coming out very soon I loved her last solo album although it was it wasn't even least in the US I don't think or if it was it took a while to actually get it over here and now she has a new album which I hope is released in the US sooner rather than later and the new ballad sounds fantastic and I want to spoil too much about it but you know the the dramatic vocals the very patient and moody guitars the fantastic percussion you know everything that I loved about her last album sort of seems to be coming through in this in this particular track which is the title of it is escaping me right now but it's not the only song that has been released from this forthcoming album so far if you check it out on Spotify or if you check it out on Apple music I think she's a really beautiful songwriter I think she has a lot of character to her voice I think she really has something special going on for her musically but for whatever reason it's just kind of not really taking over here in the States I don't really know as to why despite the fact that she's already in a band that has been praised over here like you know by critics and and music fans alike but for whatever reason it's sort of like her solo stuff isn't really taking over here even though her solo material is kind of vastly different than the wild birds and peace drums stuff you know it's not this kind of weird zany kooky heavily percussive you know vocal and drum music or anything like that you know it is some legitimate and very passionate and very beautiful art pop moving on from there I really did enjoy the new king cruel song this track titled um surfer which is kind of a really weird and interesting change of pace for Archie you know I always knew and suspected that post-punk was a huge influence on his music but I didn't think that he would so overtly go in that direction on this song or any song really because this is kind of a hard-hitting lowdown dirty filthy kind of gruff and like despondent edgy post-punk track with like a lot of guts and a lot of fire and just a lot of primal energy that I thought was pretty fantastic and I don't know man looking forward to seeing him maybe play with more sounds in this direction igloo ghost has a new track out titled white gum and this new song that he has is on a forthcoming album that's gonna be on brain feeder records and just as usual a glucose production on this thing like he is a beat master like the sound of this track is incredible like the sounds and the samples and and everything it's so jittery it's so dense it's so intense it's so mind-blowing and so off the goddamn wall you know I'm really kind of at a loss as to how to describe it like this is sort of the difficulty I would have talking about his music like his is his last EP that I loved if I had to talk about after listening to it like you know a couple times you know everything that I had to say about that record was just after numerous intensive listens you know his music is so dense even though the songs aren't incredibly long there's so much going on in one single song that it's it would take almost an eternity to explain it all and man just the detail this guy works into his tracks is just amazing and everything that he does it just sounds like it's coming from another freaking dimension so I mean if you listen to one electronic music producer this year you know if you listen to one freaking electronic electronic music producers album this year please make it the new igloo ghost album because again the sounds that he's drawing up here are incredible although not to throw any shade toward my good dude here Forte who I think has dropped one of his better tracks in a while like this is very colorful very texture rich techno track with a very lavish in full and beautiful ending I don't know what to say man he really kind of floored me a little bit with this track over here I didn't know he still kind of had you know some fresh and new ideas in him and you know sort of hoping that he can take the ambitions of this track and kind of compile it into a record because it seems like lately he's just been kind of dropping like a lot of you know Lucy's here and there a lot of spare projects here and there and you know it's it would be interesting as sort of here can build up to an album again because you know he has made some fantastic records over the years and I would love to see him sort of you know approach that once again you know especially if the material is this good got to give a shout out to my dude Christian Scott who is being very prolific this year like in the midst of releasing a trilogy and this new track over here from the latest install element of that is titled Avenger and it's kind of a very I don't know it's it's very well performed jazz track backed with some fantastic you know punchy sort of synth chords that drop it at one point in the track and a pretty steady hip-hop beat I wish the percussion was a little bit more dense did a little bit more but the trumpet performances and and just all the solos and improv in general across the track are fantastic and have a lot of personality and a lot of zest I'll leave it at that moving on I got to give a shout out to the new Bjork track of course the gate Bjork has a new track not a new track well obviously a new track but a new album coming out this year and this new song over here was an interesting one you know definitely not as I guess clearly structured as some of her most memorable work you know it's a lot of strings it's a lot of vocals it's very I guess kind of blobby it's very wispy it's very vast it's not know I guess all that well defined you know it's just like a whole sea of emotion and she sort of just dunks you into it and you know what I like to hear an entire album of stuff exactly like this probably not however given just the tone of the song given that this is the first taste of the album given that the song is titled the gate I can only assume that this is literally like a segue or an introduction or some kind of entrance into what we're going to be experiencing on this forthcoming Bjork album it does sound refreshing it does sound new it doesn't merely sound like she's kind of revisiting a certain sound or air in her career like she was on her last album Valona Keira which resembled musically and stylistically a lot of moments on Vespertine in my opinion this record sort of seems like she's doing something a little bit more ambitious a little bit more abstract thus far and looking forward to sort of hearing her take it into a new direction and finally I got to give a shout out to my boys and bad bad not good who have a new track confessions part 3 out featuring kahlan Stetson on saxophone and I don't know it's kind of like a bit of a dream collaboration a dream jazz collaboration because Colin brings so much to their sound they provide such an amazing and a fantastic musical backdrop for Colin's sort of do his thing you know with the continual breathing technique and just the fluttering and the endless cycling arpeggios it's really invigorating performance it seems like these guys have a lot of chemistry and would definitely be interested in hearing them work together and collaborate once again in the future and that's going to be it guys those are all the tracks that I wanted to bring up in this weekly track roundup thank you very much for watching again down there in the description the good people over at sea geek they are sponsoring this episode so support them all so again those tour dates are down there in the description along with our amazon associates link our turntable lab link

zSoh4uADfus,
BD7fSbQ01bs,yellow yellow flannel time flannel time flannel time haha hi everyone yellows in a yellow yellow yellow yellow here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Alex Cameron album forced witness Australian singer-songwriter Alex Cameron he has a new full-length album out I'm just getting hip to this guy this year this guy debuted with a full-length album a few years ago titled jumping the shark which is kind of a hilarious thing to title your first record but well originally got me interested in this album was a strong couple of singles leading up to the release of the album there was an amazing duet track featuring angel Olson titled strangers kiss and then there's the blood pumping adventure and wild romance of running out of luck I was excited but kind of skeptical going into this album because to be frank Cameron does look like kind of a weirdo most likely a character trait he plays up for theatrics to grab attention but some of his personality quirks seem a little too natural to merely be theatrics but Cameron is as much a misfit as he is a song Smith on this album which you wouldn't necessarily guess given just how weird and low fie and kind of difficult to sift through his last album was like I did not anticipate how much of a master of melody this dude would be I did not foresee his colorful command of the English language nor did I guess he would take the Heartland rock soft rock new wave fusion that he brought together on the few tracks that teased up to this album all the way with nearly every song here I mean I hear Bruce Springsteen on this album I hear Tom Petty I hear Bob Seger I hear some of the great bands to come out of Australia in the 80s whose music straddled a fine line between rock and synth pop I mean this album is really just filled with a lot of joyous righteous pop music that just makes you want to throw on a pair of tight jeans and a wife-beater and just like start striking a bunch of dramatic poses and no I'm not just saying that because that's essentially what Cameron is doing in the music video - running out of luck not only does Alex stick to this sound and aesthetic very closely throughout the entire album but he does this style so much justice even as he dabbles in light disco on the song Chihuahua or some slow jammed reggae and calypso on the track the Hacienda which almost rivals the Beach Boys Kokomo in ho keenest but Alex's self-awareness on the track cuts through the overly saccharine vibe of the instrumental that and just how dark and gritty his lyrics can be as he makes nods to diabetes crying babies and a variety of other CD images I can't tell if he's singing about an old folks home or a motel or a brothel or like a drug den which kind of brings me to the next major appeal of this album and that's the lyrics the lyrics on this album are insane they're borderline insane constantly varying between extremes inspiring and poignant sad and embarrassing uncomfortably gross and undeniably smart it's in his lyrics that I think Alex's true artistry really shines case in point the song True Lies where alex is singing about the joy of this online relationship which subconsciously he knows isn't real he knows that the person on the other end may in fact be catfishing him but rather than kind of acknowledge the truth that's in front of his face Alex is happy to take the blue pill and just embrace the bliss he even goes as far as to say that he said this person money this person might be a Nigerian guy but he says hey this dude writes me really beautiful poetry you should read it the song is almost like a weird al' parity and this is one of many moments on the album where Alex makes some kind of overt lyrical reference to dating people online or trying to hook up with people online or doing things online that cause strain in a relationship that he might have or give him some sort of regret namely tracks like candy may and the Chihuahua meanwhile the title of the song stud muffin 69 reads like the screen name that Alex might in fact use when he finds himself in a chat room trying to talk up some hot teenagers as in the lyrics of the song he's talking about meeting with his lover and hoping that she's 18 saying that she might be 17 I said stud muffin 69 I met 96 sorry and maybe Alex's attraction to these types of relationships can be kind of explained in the song strangers kiss with Olsson as him an angel sort of duet style sing about all that they need being in this more casual form of love the lyrics on this album aren't just funny they build up a very strong and very vivid character portrait a portrait that paints Alex both as a hilariously lovable Creepo and a hopeless romantic there are moments on this album where he triumphs like on running out of luck where he's a man on a mission with a stripper out of luck and there's blood on his knuckles cuz there's money in the trunk the sexy sax embellishments and ritzy synth chords on this track are fantastic and there are some spots on this thing where Alex's ugly side shows like on the cut marlon brando where he admits to being this fight starting hothead that calls other guy's pussies and homophobic slurs he's like a total meathead but then later in the track he like apologizes for this saying that this is behavior he knows he shouldn't do and there are some spots on here where Alex's lyrics just kind of add up to pure poetry like on politics of love where you can ride in on an eagle or you could ride in on a rug doesn't make no difference because around here there's no politics and love in a verse Alex goes as far as to say that the devil is in the details and the Shane's which is one of many couplets and one-liners on this album that are gut-busting ly hilarious and smart like on the opening line to the Chihuahua where alex says that our love was like a fire I pissed on it so I could sleep so I've gone over the sound the style and the lyrics of this album but another major selling point of this record for me is that is the goddamn songwriting the hooks they're so incredible again Alex finds so much power in this style of music in this 80s pop and rock aesthetic I wish he drove the rock vibe of the album so much more because I think it would have added to kind of the the macho character of the album to here somewhere blaring guitars on this thing but the sequence drums and the synthesizers do cover most of the bases by themselves but a myriad of course is on this thing just totally just seared themselves into my brain after just several lessons Seamus wheats week ending May got me stuck gonna wanna stay and there's blood on my knuckles cuz there's money in the trunk there's this woman on the internet and all the songs on this thing are packaged into very short very punchy to the point song lengths and a 10 track track listing there are a few tracks where I wish maybe the vocals were a bit more eccentric or the instrumentation had a bit more bite like it could have gone a bit more overboard to match alex's lyrical energy is very kooky persona you know if you were to completely ignore some of the lyrics on this thing you might assume this album is just kind of a little run-of-the-mill or doesn't have I don't know a lot of eccentric qualities about it but it's really kind of in that portrayal of Alex's character through the narratives on this album that I think this record really comes alive this album can be deceptively straightforward in a way still though I do not have a lot of complaints about this album and I enjoy the hell out of it from front to back it's whimsical it's funny it's clever it's instantaneously catchy but there are enough lyrical and musical details on this thing for me to be picking up and hearing new things every time I go back to it just to get another shot of these hooks I'm feeling a strong eight to a light nine on this thing

AL5dCMlhtRg,this is so deep it's so meaningful it's just speaking to me hi everyone Venini Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Korbin album mourn this is the latest album from singer/songwriter Corbin Smisek who broke back in 2014 under the name spooky black how anybody could have looked at this music video and not laughed I don't know this is a meme this is this is essentially a meme to me under the name spooky black Corbin had a few viral hits in the virtual realm he had an EP in album both of which in my opinion boiled down essentially to just really run-of-the-mill atmospheric moody alternative R&B and I wasn't really convinced or excited either when he started recording under the Corbin name and put out a pretty mediocre EP with the student ain't Bobby raps that that left a lot to be desired and his new album over here honestly I was just gonna write it off and go do something else but then I did anyway because there were tons of you guys just like hitting me up to listen to it and this is one of those instances where I'm happy that I have an audience of thousands of people harassing me to listen to certain things because to be real this this did impress me this is not the generic sad Reaver be R&B that passes as alternative in most circles today this is like also some painfully sad blue-eyed soul it's really synth-heavy it's really minimal it's very skeletal there's tons of production on this thing from DJ and Schlomo I think some of the instrumentals on this thing sound like they're inspired by the gothy er side of synth pop or darkwave I mean even the cover itself looks like you're you're gonna be in for some black metal and in the past few years Corbin's vocals sound like they have matured and have grown more agonized and despondent on this album it's like I'm listening to a cross-section of James Blake Sampha King cruel old old old twin shadow but then all of that is smothered in like this goth sized depression and what Corbin lacks and vocal ability on this record he makes up for in emotional delivery and painfully sad and lonely lyrics so lonely I would call the vibe of this album isolating and and the record definitely finds power in that feeling there are some moments where the songwriting is a little average and it's kind of like the structure of the track is meandering because it's almost like Corbin's singing is based mostly off of improv Zoar something like the song mourn or the song no title which kind of fizzles out at some point toward the finish even though the song delivers a very strong beginning and there are a few moments on this record where Corbin's vocals turned so sad they become borderline pathetic like on the song giving up where his singing sounds so emotionally desperate over a track that is essentially about what seems like facing facts and I assume a relationship of some kind saying that they have to give up or admit to the fact that they're lying but lying is all they have as if lying is the only thing that's kind of keeping this thing going and dealing with this is like making Corbin wriggle on the floor in a puddle of his own spit in tears with him just like screaming I'm good however when the drums really kind of kick in in the second half of the track and the song really starts to get propelled a bit that that is a point I do like on the record and there's a good handful of other tracks on this thing that really did stick with me to the song ice boy in my opinion is an incredible start to this thing the lyrics the vocals the icy synthesizers the percussion that features you know these very basic drum patterns these thudding kicks and popping snares the sound of this thing is like a perfect balance between you know a decent fidelity but it's also kind of raw it's also kind of lo-fi it sounds homespun there's a seething angst and just a huge palpable emotional tension that rides throughout this track and many others and while the instrumentation doesn't really grow that much more intense as the track plods along Corbin himself becomes this just fireball of uh just pent-up sad emotions as the track progresses the song revenge song is maybe my favorite in the batch here and features some very dark chilling and violent lyrics it out getting revenge on somebody who can guess from the the lyrics and the song raped his significant other the instrumental is very chilling the song is very cinematic listening to it's like I'm imagining sort of what's actually going on as he's singing these lyrics and kind of you know basically visualizing every piece of this storyline also I think the track features one of the better vocal melodies on the entire record - and the song all out while at first it may not sound like a lot as soon as the sort of big payoff and finish toward the end comes in I think the real appeal of the song shines through that beat drop although it's it's a relative beat drop this is still a very minimal stripped-back album I also love the lyric on here where you're singing about done being anywhere but this person's side and this is one of those albums that while the instrumentation may come off deceptively simple and there may be a lot of reverb in the mix it definitely does not take away from Corbin's personality does not take away from the distinct qualities of his vocals and it certainly does not take away from the emotional performances on these tracks - in fact I think it sort of adds to the the quality of loneliness on this album that it sounds like he's singing from the bottom of a well or something the songs something safe I also enjoyed quite a bit - it kind of seems like a depressing fusion of R&B and trip-hop with a pretty great rap verse from Antwan toward the finish of the track who I haven't heard from in a while and I think he adds so much to not just this song but the entire record the most major misstep in the track listing in my opinion has to be the song the fold-up which features these kind of bubbly almost peppy synthesizers that don't necessarily go with the overall vibe and aesthetic of the record not only that but over these synths Corbyn delivers these horrendous falsetto vocals that are so off and so out of place the song doesn't really become listenable until the second half the finishing song drag makes so much more sense as a song that comes through with a stronger vocal and some harder percussion mostly because the style of the synthesizers along with the sequence beats kind of does carry along with it that 80's goth and synth pop aesthetic with it overall I really like the vibe and aesthetic of this album quite a bit there are a lot of solids and tracks on here Corbin has a stronger sense of style here than he has on any project he's released so far and I think there's a good handful of songs on this thing - and I think Corbin is also on the verge of something actually refreshing with this alternative pop and R&B sound that being said this is not an incredibly consistent album though there are definitely some flubs or some underwhelming moments in the tracklisting but after hearing this I will certainly be looking forward to whatever Corbin does next that will not be even thinking about writing it off I'm feeling a light - decent seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which would I overview next hit the like feel like please subscribe and please don't die stay healthy and stay hydrated over here next to my head is a kink rule review you can't click on that watch another video or you can't click on the link to subscribe to the channel cool cool I'll see you guys in the next one Corbin mourn forever

6RymqLslg7s,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Zola Jesus album Oh Co V this is the latest musical outing from phoenix singer songwriter producer Nika Rosa Dani lova aka Zola Jesus who made her solo full-length studio album debut on sacred bones records back in 2009 and she has not looked back since continually striking while the iron's hot with her strig ulam and Valusia EPS in 2010 her kinetise album in 2011 her versions record in 2013 which was essentially a bunch of stripped back renditions of recently recorded material and then she gave us a shot at a wider appeal on her tyga album via mute records where that was kind of a less overt dark like really brooding goth kind of approach on this album it was like more of a direct art pop affair it didn't really win her the new audience she was clearly shooting for and it turned off a lot of her older fans who preferred her darker material on her latest effort here a cofee though she seems to be bringing that back and honestly this is the most I've ever looked forward to a Zola Jesus album mostly because the instrumental presentation seemed so much bigger grander more epic it seems like she's trying to leave a large impression on the listener like she did with Tyga but she's letting the full extent of her goth influences kind of sprawl out into these instrumentals like a vial of black dye into a water tank of post-industrial goth dark wave art pop I mean this is the heaviest and fullest set of instrumentals I've heard on Azolla album so far and it definitely gives nica's music a new level of drama and presence these tracks for me were especially convincing as singles like the song exhumed which has like some of the most booming drums and rushing strings I've heard on one of her tracks so far which blew me away when I first heard it even if the song is kind of worn on me a little bit as I've listened to the track over and over and there were other singles and highlights going into the album too that I was really happy to hear but I guess as an entire record it's not really wow me as much as I hoped it would partially because the the vibe and the aesthetic the whole feel of the album just so uniform the gargantuan percussion the area heavy synth tones and Zola's voice which is usually chorused and performed with like this this this bellowing delivery I feel like this record really could have used a little bit more sonic and stylistic variety surely that comes here and there like I'm the track siphon which is measurably more positive and uplifting when compared with other tracks probably because of its song subject Zola singing about a friend of hers who was just off of a suicide attempt and she's basically trying to kind of be that that shoulder and I also really like the change of pace that the song remains brought to the table which has this kind of driving glamorous dance beat that sounds like it's straight out of the 80s but for the most part I felt like this album could have used a bit more bike could have been a little bit more direct and to go back to the vocals a little bit I felt like they could have been changed up just a tad too because truth be told the Zola's delivery is not really that dynamic and rarely does her singing come off really all that human I mean certainly her singing feels dramatic at first but it almost feels like kind of a gear that she just hangs in without really bringing it down or revving it up to any intensity points exceptions being the song siphon again or the track witness which reads a lot like a song from versions where her voice doesn't seem as dolled up you just mostly have strings in the background it's one of the more raw and intimate spots on the album and there are certainly some weak links in the songwriting chain on this thing tracks that while the instrumental presentation may be huge the song at the core of the track is really not all that catchy it's not all that memorable or we have tracks on here that are structured very weakly or just kind of seem like these short detours Beca soak Ashta bone in general just the shorter more interlude type tracks don't really enhance the flow of the record that much and I don't know just given how few exciting and fantastic songs are delivered across the track listing the mostly instrumental neoclassical closer half life seems almost like a cop-out like it was just thrown into the end just because it was one of the most low-key tracks on here it was not very vocal driven it doesn't really wrap the album up in any significant way in my piñon I mean don't get me wrong there are at least a handful of great tracks on this thing that I really enjoyed instrumentally this is one of Zola's most ambitious projects it's one of her darkest projects generally I like the aesthetic of the album too but I can only praise this so much because there really are some shortcomings in terms of the album flow consistency the ratio of legitimate songs to interlude filler on this thing I'm feeling too light too decent six on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment

AuEKWOh8_HE,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new death from above 1979 album outrage is now death from above is a canadian rock duo known for their fantastic and only album they dropped in the 2000s you're a woman I'm a machine shortly after which they kind of dropped off the map as a band to focus on separate musical endeavors only to return with a sophomore album a decade later the physical world in 2014 and going into this record I could only think two things one it's been so long since Sebastian and Jessie wrote and performed together there's gonna be some kinks to work out and if these guys were just chock-full of ideas great ideas for another album the follow-up would have come much sooner and while the physical world was by no means an awful album it pretty much confirmed those assumptions however after this album I was happy to hear that Jessie and Sebastian were going to be working on another album and continuing the band into the future and as long as that continues to be the case I feel like these guys have the potential to reach the next high point in their career which brings us to outrages now and this is in my opinion this is the album this is the record that I wish the physical world was this is the album that in spirit I think is truly the duo's comeback album it's just unfortunate that there are less eyes and ears and what the duo are doing at this moment because the initial hype of them reforming is gone but keep in mind this is not another you're a woman I'm a machine Sebastian and Jessie do change things up stylistically a bit their sound is still relatively simple and heavy mostly made up of driving drumbeats wailing roaring bass riffs and Sebastian's vocals occasionally of course and keyboards or pianos being worked into a track to give it more dynamics and body but overall on this record I would say that there's less of a direct speedy throttling Punk influence as there was on their earlier work and that's kind of been swapped out for like almost a hardrock influence like from the late 70s to the mid to late 80s and it's kind of a sound the duo pulls off very well they fit it into their usual style and aesthetic pretty snugly to the point where it's not really a distracting change case in point the song never swim alone which has this strutting staccato riff it has so much swagger so much color this is one of many moments on this record where the riffs just sound larger more arena size the drum beats or funkier and groovier a few tracks take a slightly more brooding approach - like there are some very expressive dramatic monie lead vocals on the song never forever that kind of remind me of marilyn manson the song moonlight as well features these dark lurking verses that kind of give way to a melodic chorus that the band reveals more and more of as the song progresses interesting way to structure the track and has a very sharp climax at the finish in a way death from above is kind of bringing back the shameless attitude and confidence that rock music used to have in spades not a corner of this album feels unsure of itself in fact I'm pretty sure this record thinks it's the shit and it's pretty convincing from the thunderous fight riffs on the opening track Nomad to the direct eye contact I'm hitting on you dominance of the song all I see is you and me and this thing is a tight 10 tracks 36 minutes there's not really a whole lot of room for frills or BS and the duo manages to pack a lot of punch onto this record at a pretty short amount of time with lots of infectious riffing and sticky choruses to take it back to the song nomads which features one of the best courses on the entire record it also has a very smart turn of phrase on the hook - the song is obviously about someone who is a nomad always on the go doesn't necessarily have a home tying the word Nomad into the phrase no matter where you go no matter what you do it may seem like a dumb pun but it works into the lyrical flow of the song really nicely the song frees me who's uppity bass riffs and keyboards were kind of a turn-off to me when I first heard it grew on me a bit and I think it was mostly the sharp vocal melodies on the hook and some of the harmonies toward the finish of the track that really just kind of melted my heart also I kind of liked the lyrical theme of the song of being frozen by someone's stare who was your significant other or someone who you're interested in or kind of being in this like weird relationship limbo period the song has one of the more solid finishes of any track the record - and the title track is a kind of interesting change of pace for the lyrics as well it's kind of a surprising socio-political statement about just the value and obsession over anger and outrage generally right now I guess it's also kind of a statement on oversensitivity and just feeling alienated and feeling almost outside of it in a way where you're confused and this I could kind of read into a couple of different ways I mean for sure they're going to be people who hear this track and think if you're not outraged you're not paying attention and that's totally fine that's totally a fair point I think maybe the biggest shortcoming of the track is just how general the statements of the song are I mean in the era of Trump there's a lot to be outraged about however given that Jessie and Sebastian are adult human beings with eyes and ears and functioning brains I would probably imagine that they're most likely reacting to I don't know outrage over stuff like manspreading or white people using reaction gifts that have black people in them which yes people are legitimately mad about that bullshit something tells me when they were writing this song they didn't have the military-industrial complex or you know Republican political policy or I don't know Americans general lack of healthcare in mind I also enjoy the track sonically it's kind of slow sterile somewhat synthetic and kind of post-apocalyptic intro the ominous bass riffs that kick off on the first pre-chorus that that build up to a really powerful heavy just gargantuan hook I also like Sebastian kind of recycling old rock cliched lyrics like you know scream and shout to kind of talk about you know the idea of outrage or depicting it rather I also like the weird warped chorus vocals on the song statues it's like I'm listening to the vocals or just the track itself melt before my ears is the kind of blasts into the hook and the song statues I can't quite put my finger on it is it about people who are wallflowers or don't really take that many risks in life or don't go out and get what they want and let other people step or sort of get ahead of them talking about statues kind of being built to last and they're obviously in in good shape but that's all because you know they don't weather any storms they're also these like weird metallic sounds that pop up occasionally in the mix it's like this little extra bit of sound play that kind of keeps this album from sounding too plain to strip back to I don't know colorless and the song holy books I mean as far as like the energy the pace the riffing it's like everything I loved about the band's previous work but it has a badass and a very well-put-together kind of piano break in the second half that's really beautiful gives the album almost like a nice elegant finish and as far as the lyrics go I mean it's kind of like a ass-kicking athiests anthem sebastian singing about how you don't go for no holy books because those ancient lines they ain't got no hooks i I think is one of the sharpest lines on the entire record I don't know man I was really impressed with this album while it's definitely not the you know the shot of heroin and just the rush at the debut album was I can appreciate the band is actually evolving on this album trying new things taking risks getting a little bit more dynamic still writing some very solid tunes and actually like really starting to sound more like a well-oiled machine rather than you know with the last record where they embarked on some kind of awkward experiments and rehashed a bunch of sounds and ideas from their earlier work that just kind of felt like a lesser comparison this to me feels like a lot of the original spirit of death from above intact but kind of embarking on a slightly different direction approach sound and this actually kind of makes me excited and looking forward to where the duo is going from here even if they don't manage to amass the same amount of hype and excitement over their future releases as they have in the past I'm feeling a strong 7th to late 8th on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry come in the comments if you're angry death from above outrage there's a video next to my head of a review of the group's last album the duo's last album or you can click on the link to subscribe to the the channel alright guys I'll see you in the next one forever 
jKAdZXNFt-0,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for another edition a late night edition of weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and worst tracks of the week now before I get into that of course I have to I have to mention a few things number one our fantastic sponsor the good people over at gangster doodles an illustration brand spearheaded by one mr. Marlon sassy to my understanding fantastic dude who has sort of immortalized many members of the hip-hop community and beyond with these amazing little gangster doodles that he does and he has a new book out and there's a link down there in the description where you can check out the book there is a intro and a forward on this thing written by Jeff jank and Shia LaBeouf and also I wanted to open this before you know I talked about it so that I would have more to say but he's like don't open it yet because I want everyone to see the gangster doodles loco Shrunk rap on the book itself and does look awesome however it does come off with the shrink wrap and I am now pulling it off because apparently yours truly is in this book and I wanted to see it so I don't know man like you guys can probably see this like oh this is cool there's Tupac oh awesome there's like 21 Savage there's the Nintendo 64 logo and somebody pouring the 40 ounce on a couple asses I didn't know this was gonna be like a risque oh damn here's like a satanic Jigglypuff these are awesome okay I think I saw Solange there oh and there's I think I saw Corbin that Stone Cold Steve Austin there's a wow there's Thundercat and okay these are awesome Tyler the Creator oh nice I think I just saw the weekend and there's yg obviously and oh man that's nice I don't even know oh there's Death Grips there's more Death Grips there's Patrick Starr there's chance the rapper oh man these are cool you're awesome I think I just saw fka twigs Danny Brown David Bowie I can't sort of sift through this whole thing looking for your boy unfortunately because I do have some tracks to get to you know I do have some tracks to get to and I don't want to spoil the whole book you know I don't want to spoil the whole book for you guys because these are really fun doodles a lot of interesting and very hilarious pop-culture references in this thing oh there's a nice Jay Z tribute in there it's a nice seinfeld tribute it's you're awesome good burger oh man I loved that movie back in the day these are great and this is so cool I've enjoyed this guy's stuff on Instagram and it's sort of cool to see it I don't know just kind of in person in real life you just have such a quirky visual style and I'm gonna enjoy looking through this book they get just on gnar doir - okay this is dank this is dank this is dank this is dank as hell this is so dank what was that okay that was okay yeah this is dank okay I'm not gonna I'm not gonna keep boring you guys with this but listen this is our sponsor this is an awesome freaking book this is an awesome little collection of illustrations and I know that a lot of people out there know about the you know gangster doodles brand but may not be aware of the fact that it is now a book okay so get that shit support our sponsor link down there in the description also got to mention that we are doing a tour this year West Coast and East Coast dates links down there below you know Seattle Portland some California dates we're in Massachusetts Connecticut New York Brooklyn check it out also our amazon associates link if you live in the u.s. you click on that link you buy something on amazon which you hit the home page we get kicked back from it does not add to your overall price supports the segment supports the channel we got a similar thing going on with the good people over at turntable lab a website where you can buy many colorful pressings of records that I ever viewed on my channel and also you know audio equipment turntable stuff freaking speakers you know for your budding record collector whether it be you or one in your life so again we get kickback from all that stuff and let's get into the worst tracks of the week even though I'm now not in the mood to do the worst tracks Louie because I just want to spend the next half hour looking at this book all right let's kill it first Zain god Zane has a new track out featuring SIA and see his hook on this track is the only good thing about it Zen continues to be a boring singer a boring song writing boring songwriter assuming that he even wrote this song most likely he had some input from other people because I don't really think of Zane as much of a songwriter but yes still a boring singer still incredibly drab verses from the sky I don't get why his music career continues to thrive because he makes such tedious emotionless and horrible music actually if you watch the music video to this thing where he's like being confronted by this dude and he's in his face and Zane's like you you don't know me you don't know me it was all I could do to not laugh let's move on from there because I can only talk about how mediocre Zane is for for a certain amount of time because it's really nothing to say u2 has a new very lackluster track out titled you're the best thing about me it's one of the most saccharine unlikable and annoying singles in a long time there's nothing really about the track that doesn't annoy me the bland bass lines the you know the the run-of-the-mill sort of stereotypical u2 guitar work Bono's lyrics it's it's really all just kind of beneath the band even though they're at a point in their career where they're consistently releasing some of their most lackluster music this is in my opinion kind of a new low and finally in the worst track segment let's shout out our good friend tuflow who last time I talked about her music you may have caught me sort of saying her her new record lady wood was not good and of course somebody who would of a woman being aroused as having lady wood she has an amazing new sing out titled disco tits with a in a very unsettling Lee I don't know it's a kind of rapey cover like I know that's not a you know very political politically correct thing to say but this covers like kind of borderline disgusting and gross there's something like kind of disturbing about it like it's it's not like very she looks like she's being almost strangled into being asleep and she her eyes don't look like they're working right now like it's it's really unsettling and of course it's an awful song like tuflow does not have anything in the way of vocal flavor or personality the instrumental is really bland it's just kind of a substance less pop song with like no life no vivacious energy and considering just like how in-your-face like the sexual energy is with the visual here like there's absolutely nothing sexy about the track it's really drab it's really boring there's really nothing to it it's trash so let's move on to the tracks that I wasn't amazed by but certainly thought were worth shouting out and pointing out to you guys first st. Vincent has a new track out titled I don't want to mess this up loss ageless and I get that the song is kind of a commentary on you know sort of the vanity of Los Angeles and Californian culture but in my opinion this is kind of another bland single from miss Clark unfortunately I don't know ever since she's been working with Jack Antonoff on sort of this new material here like her new work seems to have like less life less quirk less risks less adventure you know for sure there are moments were like the the chorus kind of revs up on this track and some of her really herky-jerky weird guitar work on this song that definitely you know has the usual bite you know the art-rock bite that you would like out of a st. Vincent song but the majority of this track especially the verses are very underwhelming and totally boring and I'm just not really sure what to make of this new Saint Vincent material because it's it's not that exciting and the New York track you know the more I actually revisited it and listen to it the more I don't know actually just run-of-the-mill it felt to me as well I'm really not excited honestly to hear this forthcoming st. Vincent album it seems like Annie and Jack are kind of getting together to I don't know try to put her into more of a pop lane and it's not really working out so well in my opinion so far but there you go next we have a new track from mr. ski mask the slump god this one features ASAP ferg and little yachty it's not a bad single you know I mean not the best lyrical performance from yachty not the most exciting instrumental ASAP ferg does drop a killer verse at the finish of the track though you know he does bring a lot of energy right at the very end to kind of give this song a great climax again you know not the most memorable single I've heard from ski mask but you know certainly worth mentioning the new Sam Smith track is a decent ballad you know maybe not as memorable or as instantaneously captivating as stay with me but certainly you know some good singing very glamorous very emotional you know very dramatic as you would expect from Sam it's not a bad track at all the new Primus single it says the desaturating seven here although that is not the single I'm talking about thank you very much Jeremy although I should have checked this myself the Primus song that I'm talking about is the scheme although the desaturation 7 I think is actually the title of the album and that was the title track I could totally be mistaken with that I'm you know literally up shit creek without a paddle in front of you guys right now because I do these fucking videos raw so let me continue making an ass of myself and just say that this new single over here I thought that the the mixing on this one did not have as much bite as I would have liked from you know at this point from Primus in their career and I don't think it's you know the most hard-hitting track that I've heard from them you know recently I was kind of hoping that they would go back to Frizzle Fried basics in a sense which when I heard the desaturating 7 you know the the first single from this record certainly seemed like that and not that I think that this song is you know certainly going forward into you know the band's discography toward like anti pop or something like that you know to reference another record where I think Primus was just like a little too over the top or something you're just a little too you know kooky to almost a fall it seems like you know they're playing it so subtle and so reserved that it's kind of hard to get excited about it but I don't know it's a track that seems like a little bit more of a slow burn or could definitely grow on me within the context of the of the record new Miguel track over here I know he's been dropping singles lately and I haven't been talking about them but this one definitely stopped me in my tracks so this track being titled shock-and-awe and it had kind of a weird funky quirky somewhat left-field almost like you know nerd NE Rd Pharrell almost like kind of aesthetic to it you know from the instrumental and the flow and the personality like there was a lot of fun and cool ideas about this track that um you know to me red is like a little more eccentric as I typically a little more eccentric than I typically get out of a Miguel song you know so definitely uh you know hoping to kind of see that continue to trend wanted to shout out the new Hoodie Allen song over here Hoodie Allen is a pop rapper whose work I have been a huge fan of in the past and I wouldn't even say that I'm a huge fan of the song however you know it's a decent track and I do admire hoodies hustle I do admire the fact that he has you know sort of come up really successfully and pretty much independently as a white rapper and he's totally sidestep the usual amount of hate and you know general amount of dislike that guys like G easy and McLemore has gotten not that I think that the hip-hop game is like totally embraced him either he's just really kind of in his own lane he's on his own thing and you know his fans really fuckin love the shit out of him and while this single is not you know really all that much my style I do think it is one of the better tracks he's put out because I have been following his singles for a long time because I do admire you know him doing things on his own terms so uh you know keep it up hoodie you're the man I also want to shout out this new Godspeed you black Emperor seong the godspeed you black Emperor track over here that I wanted to mention is titled anthem for no state part three this track to me seemed like the band was really starting to take some risks which is what I was hoping for when their last album kind of underwhelming however I'm not sure what the band is doing on this track really kind of pans out there's a really huge emphasis on trumpets as the band is kind of building up the instrumentation on this track and accidentally it's almost got kind of like a weird somber almost like mariachi kind of feel it's probably 1% unintentional you know but it's just like kind of a weird vibe that I got off the track you know but there was something kind of about the instrumental build up the track like the more instrumentation that got added it's not like the heavier or the more aggressive the instrumentation got it's like the more cluttered it kind of sounded it's not your usual god speed build-up there was something almost kind of groovy and psychedelic about the way the instrumentation was kind of bleeding into itself a little bit and honestly while I do love God speed and they have been one of my favorite bands over the years it is kind of difficult to boil their appeal down to any one song in their discography so you know I thought the single was okay you know definitely didn't get my mouth watering as much as I probably would like a single two but um you know certainly not a disappointing by any stretch of the imagination just kind of hoping that maybe it Wowz me a little bit more once I hear it on the actual album and doom this new track that he has out from this you know sort of forthcoming or kind of slowly being dropped notebook project that Adult Swim is essentially releasing kind of one b-side or notebook you know verse or track or whatever from him once a week until basically the whole thing is finished this track over your features cool Keith it's you know not the best song I've ever heard him on but you know it has a solid Keith versus solid Keith feature and a solid doom feature which out of all the verses I've heard him drop in this notebook series so far this one sounds to be like the most recently record because some of the lyrics seem like you know that they're reflective of very recent events so um you know in the end the performance and the sound of his voice wasn't really that bad either so yeah you know kind of digging this track it's obviously not like blow me away is like some of his best stuff has but you know it's pretty good and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best songs of the week shall we alright gotta give a shout-out to wise blood who has dropped a couple of covers this week and this one she dropped of the soft machine track a certain a certain something the title is not in front of me and it's escaping me a certain kind is actually really fantastic sort of like beautiful rendition of the song so I wanted to kind of point you guys toward that cover young thug has teamed up with carnage a producer who you know has dabbled in a lot of different stuff he's known for a lot of his you know almost like electronic dance music style cuts and together I believe they're sort of forming this duo and they've named themselves young Martha and they had this new single out with Meek Mill and it is the craziest frickin shit I have heard this month and I guess it's the beginning of September but I'll COUNTA August in that as well like young thug's voice on this thing I thought it was another rapper but like the hook on this thing he's digging down and talking this like really gruff or almost like Cookie Monster kind of voice and then when he goes into his verse it's hype as hell the beat is awesome Meek Mill whose stick I have been getting kind of tired of lately his high-energy sort of shouting style definitely matches the energy of the track and I don't know man I think that young thug actually not I would say I was gonna say lately but actually like throughout much of his career has been really inconsistent you know he tends to like emphasize more quantity over quality however I think if he's working with another artist who wants this to be sort of his best project in a while which I assume is going to be the case for carnage that um you know he could really kind of help thug get a rout like a huge you hear and you know again if the single is any indication this thing is gonna be like Bangor City USA population you and me and everybody fucking else who can handle it alright I got to give a shout out to Street sects who have a new EP dropping via the flen sir and this new track from it is titled in prison at least I had you these tracks seem way more depressing sombre and despondent and low-key in comparison to like much of what was on their album and position which was like a noise rock industrial sort of like I don't know like torture chamber these tracks over here total 180 in terms of intensity and mood however like they're still also very satisfying and gratifying and interesting like I'm I'm I'm excited and it's really cool to kind of hear the the band sort of displays some new dynamics and take some risks and do something different and not just kind of paint themselves into this loud abrasive aggressive corner you know definitely showing another side of themselves and you know kind of flexing their songwriting muscle - and I don't know just really loving the track check it out gotta give a shout out to primitive man who sound like they are gonna drop the heaviest noisiest most nihilistic album of the goddamn decade like Jesus Christ every single time they drop a new track from this thing it just crushes my fucking soul and I don't know what else to say other than that man you got to give a listen to this track it's titled to commerce and again it you know it'll kill you it'll kill you and I just want to make sure yeah commerce this this thing is soul-crushing it kind of reminds me of like what I really loved about Indian before they broke up but it's just like so over the top while primitive man sound in the past has been noisy for sure like this is like the next goddamn level this is like the next goddamn level of noisy and heavy it's just really oppressive and I love it lunes is our next best track over here who has a new cut out featuring Sophie and Leif and Sophie and Leif together kind of bring you know just like a lot of quirk and you know interesting elements into the track you know it's got a lot of personality it's you know kind of a fruity fun bubbly kinda weird you know I guess kind of postmodern banger I guess you could say but uh but yeah pretty excited for this Lunas project gotta give a shout out to mark kozilek who has a new album on the way soon with excuse me Ben boy and Jim white and I'm like over here touching buttons and messin up this new track over here is kind of dark and somber I like the instrumental vibe that feels very natural and organic much like you know on a lot of the songs from the album that mark dropped you know valleys of blood earlier this year that I really loved I haven't reviewed much of what mark has done since then and but he's just like prolifically dropping one project after another and again loved the instrumental on this track and the lyrics on this song are really interesting too like it's all about a dream that he had that involved Elliott Smith so um you know I'm not gonna spoil too much about it beyond there but I definitely give it a shot definitely give it a listen because it is a it is pretty interesting alright next injury reserve we have a couple more tracks left they have a new single out from their forthcoming project drive it like it's stolen these guys originally from Arizona they're based out of California now they made the move so now they're on the west coast and they're killing it over there and already man they're releasing a new project they're following up floss pretty quickly and this new single that they just released is easily one of the most depressing and personal singles that they've dropped from any project so far so you know don't come into this thing expecting just kind of an all-out banger but I think you know it's it's kind of good to remind fans of just kind of the emotional dynamics of injury reserve because sometimes it's really kind of those personal and those inter sort of introspective rather spots in their records that really kind of hit at least me the hardest and kind of leave the biggest impression on me because you know especially Richie with a tee you know he says like some real fucking moving shit you know he has some of the most moving verses on the group's last project so I don't know man just want to shout out this track it's a really good song really moving track and hmm ltd or i guess they were formerly known as happy meal limited or something really cool post-punk act with just like really an vicious and huge production this is one of their biggest slow burners so far and I don't know man it does have like a a really kind of drawn-out introduction but once like the instrumentation and the energy of the track hits it is huge definitely not as instantaneously mind-blowing as some of their previously released tracks but still this kind of continues to make my mouth water for whatever album they're gonna have coming out very soon hopefully because 20th 2017 is almost over would have to wait for what he would have to would hate to have to wait for 2018 excuse me I'm a little tired and I can't talk but uh you know if it takes that I will and finally I want to give a shout out to Chelsea wolf who has a new track out titled the culling although I don't want to talk too much about it because I am reviewing her new album very soon and I am very excited about it and I do think this track is very good so uh those are all the things that I wanted to shout out those are all the tracks that I wanted to focus on thank you very much guys remember our sponsor gangster doodles oh there we go right there gangster doodles again this book is fantastic it's beautiful the illustrations are colorful and amazing and I just saw I just saw a fixed twin in here too and the Bootsy Collins that's nice these are awesome and also again our tour dates coming up in October in October hit up that link in

cPIJXJZH1zk,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets meanest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new self-titled bicep album its its self-titled this is the debut full-length album from uk-based DJs and producers Andrew Ferguson and Matthew McBride who have not only been creating house music for years at this point but also covering it showcasing some of the best and brightest the genre has to offer with their feel my bicep blog which expanded into a label that they've released their own music on so after numerous EPS and singles and almost a full decade of celebrating everything house techno funk and disco I could only say that Andrew and Matt's years as taste makers helped them develop a a very nice sound on the stay beyou album what I can say about this record is that it delivers tons of no frills house techno and more it delivers some very good grooves it's very physical but simultaneously its heady enough to stand up to very intent engage listening for an hour there's not quite as much sound play as I typically like in my electronic music on this thing but these guys still go into this project with some really good fundamentals the way they paced these tracks out with percussive progressions and an epic melodies is very nice pacing these tracks out carefully with tasteful percussive and melodic progressions enough to keep the tracks engaging but you know not so much that they're not still subtle their hypnotic but they're also kind of visceral it's a good mix of head and heart it kind of has that calculated somewhat robotic feel to it but simultaneously the extra splashes of atmosphere that they add to some of the melodies kind of give these songs an epic feel like on the song Orko which comes off in my opinion as a very dramatic very grand a very cinematic opener not only that but there are a couple of interlude cuts on this thing that read to me is if they could have been worked into some kind of I don't know soundtrack for a moody dystopian art film like the song Vespa or especially the track drift with it's very tight synth arpeggios and elongated of ringing lead melodies the more fully developed cuts on this thing are really what steal the show though like the somber but heavenly glue divide the duo condors on this thing is blissfully chill it's kind of easy to get lost in the female vocal samples and the sad stuttering lead melodies there's also a very Airy beautiful Balearic beat vibe coming off the track yeah yeah I love the atmosphere on this track the groove is amazing it's really relaxing it's a nice change of pace Akande songs like spring which is much more driving you have those pushy quarter note kick drums a bouncy bassline very ghostly vocal samples the track is also kind of an exercise in tension building the more I listen to it the more I get this sense that it's just climbing higher and higher and higher and the song rain is probably the closest the album comes to delivering a true banger probably the hardest song on the entire record like when the beat dropped on this track I was just oh there are just a lot of very well crafted and well assembled tracks on this record it's slightly unfortunate though that they come together kind of like a compilation like certainly there was attention paid to how they came together as a collective because there is quite a bit of variety amongst these tracks and they do kind of have a uniform 'l almost I don't know chillness to all of them or moodiness or spacious beauty but playing it so subtly on these tracks did lead to some songs that I thought were just a little too middle-of-the-road or didn't have that much bite or that much flavor I like the track kites or the song opal which in my opinion the morning listen to it the more tedious the track felt because it doesn't really offer much more than this single groove and a single chord progression and sure the duo does deliver a couple different variations of that across the track but it's just kind of I don't know too little in terms of progression to keep things interesting the song air has a pretty nice downtempo vibe to it it's very elegant but it's not as exciting as some of the previous tracks in the track listing and the track veil for as prominent as the female lead vocal on that track is it's it's not I don't know really so great in terms of performance that it's it's deserving of the focal point that it's given still though this album is a pretty good mixed bag it's one of the more solid house releases I've heard while the duo does touch down on a lot of different stylistic bases on this thing which was really nice I guess going forward I would just hope that more musical risks are taken but for right now this thing sets a good solid foundation for hopefully some more ambitious expectations in the future I'm feeling a decent a strong seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate here the best you the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're angry Anthony Fantino

OlCJ_BlisoY,"hey-ho hey-ho i went to the restaurant and I ordered the lobster and the lobster came to the table and said hey you what's up there and I said I don't know I'm about to eat some lobster is it good and he said I think so eat me eat my flesh eat my body hole eat me eat me now hi everyone Green screaming tan I'm here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Action Bronson album blue chip 7000 New York rapper Action Bronson is back with a new full-length commercial project his latest installment of the blue chip series which he's released a few mixtapes in so far where he typically gets together with producer party supplies however on this project he's not working exclusively with party supplies so he's bringing on guys like knowledge The Alchemist Harry fraud alchemist and Harry fraud have brought him some pretty fantastic beats in the past so I'm pretty excited to hear him work with them again and these guys delivered a Bronson this smooth classy backdrop of ritzy jazz funk and 70 soundtrack music there's an amazing reggae flip on the song hot pepper featuring Jah Tiger and mayhem Lauryn and the really glamorous instrumental on the track 924 7000 is exactly the backdrop you would want to have for a guest feature for the likes of Rick Ross the singles on this thing didn't really Wow me or stick with me but there was no way that this project could have been as disappointing and Bronson's last album which surprised me because the teaser tracks to that thing were some of the best material Bronson had released to date but then the deeper cuts on this record I mean there were so many filler cuts there were so many tracks where he would go on these weird artistic detours like he's singing blue chip 7 is is much more consistent Bronson sounds like the star of his own exploitation film loaded with bars that never run out of booze guns that never run out of bullets babes and bikinis muscle cars he's sliding across the hood of one that kind of and lyrically Bronson depicts himself is living this comedic Lee lavish lifestyle I mean the opening track on here not only kicks off with audio of Bronson getting high with his mom and his mom is trying to describe how high she is it's one of the funniest things I've heard this year but also this line where he's talking about showing up to a wedding wearing Puerto Rican Air Force Ones not a detail that that usually comes up with a lot of other rappers lyrics there was also the set of bars about clapping for the chef bringing a duck to the table like a roast duck and it's glowing like an angel then he goes on to say he's never trusted a guy named angel and they he pulls the long sleeve for fits and turns into an angel just the sense of humor and the way of just kind of bringing three different perspectives that one word the record is just loaded with these sharp little one-liners or just exquisite details that Bronson brings two descriptions of food or people or situations or even himself that are just so extra and I mean extra in the best way possible extra in such a way where it makes his whole shtick his whole style special and it makes the world that he pulls the listener into so much more entertaining sometimes Bronson's similes can get a little questionable like on the track hot pepper where he says he's a he's going out of his mind like Tom Hanks with the soccer ball the soccer ball despite these shortcomings Bronson does bring an incredible amount of personality to this project when it comes to personality Bronson is like a five-course meal he's the soup the salad the appetizer the entree and the dessert Bronson has character and flow and heart but I can't help but feel like this project still suffers from a lot of the big-ticket grander scheme problems that some of his previous projects did like a lot of songs on this thing are super short and some of the ones that do manage to reach the 3-minute mark are padded out with like instrumental dead air these needless intros and outros well not to say that they're completely needless a lot of them are very entertaining but some of them just take up way too much of a singletrack songs like the choreographer or la Luna or Banzai and my right lung are some of this album's biggest offenders as much as I think the bar about his Colombian princess coming at you in the neck with the scissors until it looks like Twizzlers is one of the most funny bars I've heard this year the song itself is not very well structured it's kind of like a lyrical interlude or something and when bronson does work in a hook like on the song let me breathe it just kind of seems like it's just for the purpose of making a joke and to be a little tongue-in-cheek which in theory is fine but when it's one of the few songs on here that's like actually kind of built up to work as an effective single bronson occasionally gets by without a good chorus because his bars are kind of personal telling or delivered in a passionate manner like on the track tank but a lot of blue chips 7,000 just seems to be a little too casual to be as epic as i think an action bronson project could be because for once it would be great to hear an album that feels as larger-than-life as the personality that action bronson brings to the table because he's not this one-dimensional guy he has emotional dynamics to his music like the devastating feelings on the song chop-chop-chop or the humorous grit of the track the chairman's intent the undeniable charm of hot pepper and just how ridiculous and bombastic and over-the-top the track do-rag verses head band is like the Wayne's World reference on that track is so funny that even action sort of stops to laugh himself at it so the dynamics and the personality and I feel like the fundamentals and the bass line talent are certainly here on this record but they just need to be built up into something greater than the sum of their parts hopefully what blue chip 7000 is ultimately is just Bronson kind of holding us over a little bit longer until he gives us something a bit grander in scope I'm feeling a decent strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next did the like if you like please

0cov3rgF3MY,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly y-you know review we're in a series of short videos guantlet style i go over a bunch of records that i did not review this past month I apologize that I didn't give them a full length review I'm a single person I can't review everything as much as I would like to link down there in the description and at the end of this video is a playlist where you can check out our previous Y you know reviews and without further ado let's just get into the why you know review hahaha Tran I did like the singles to this record but listening to the entire album while going deeper into it I certainly was very impressed with the guitar work on this thing very creative very colourful very angular I don't think it's out of place to really say that the vocals left a lot to be desired you know the vocals were easily the most underwhelming aspect of this entire record and given that it is a rock album with a bit of a punky sort of spirit to it I think that could have been a lot better it could have been a lot better as much as I've been wanting Collin to experiment a little bit more instrumentally on his solo stuff and just kind of venture out of his solo comfort zone a little bit and you know put out some more records where you know he's delivering us more than just saxophone this to me was a little underwhelming because I feel like everybody could have done just a little bit more to make this an instrumental record that was exciting simply as an instrumental record for the most part I feel like I'm listening to a lot of very trendy a lot of very modern a lot of very somewhat underground but popular with hipster blends of metal music but with like a little bit of added saxophone and are the composition so enthralling are they so intricate that they feel good without vocals because they don't have vocals there are no vocals on this thing not really you know a lot of the time I'm just wishing I could hear a vocalist on this thing because you know it is kind of a blend of post metal black metal like elements of sludge metal here as well like a little bit of like almost almost like a jazz rock thing going on there's so many interesting genres coming together in a seamless way on this record which i think is a good thing but um you know I feel like it could have been more detailed I feel like there could have been a little bit more power and muscle to the performances to the point where it just didn't sound like you know another hipster metal band but sans vocals I get and I understand that wiki says that this is that this is an album this is unlike anything he's done before it's not a project or a tape or whatever but I don't know it feels just as weighed down by unnecessary tracks as as little me was you know there are so many tracks on here that feel kind of unfinished or don't really have much in the way of like a strong structure or a hook I mean especially a goddamn hook you know listen I still enjoy wikis rapping I still think his bars are cool as inflections are cool but I feel like he could have done a little bit better to organize this thing and really craft some hard-hitting songs you know I enjoy some of the more abstract moments on this record but sometimes it just seems like these abstractions are really just him not wanting to build a song up rather just kind of find a really odd way left-field instrumental and just like spit some crazy shit over it yeah which if you like it it's fine but it's just a little bit too long for him to just kind of simply be doing that for a majority of the time this record you know was just hoping for something a little bit more focused I guess and epic you know this is a very pleasant sweet rustic folk rock and and singer-songwriter music it's it's very nice it's very nice it's not that memorable it's not memorable but it's very sweet it's very nice to listen to it's very kind of lazy Sunday music and chances are the more you like it the more it's just gonna woo you with its subtle charms so why the hell not you know I wouldn't call this an essential listen for OneNote Rick's point never fans there is some interesting sound play on this thing not a whole lot in terms of like enthralling compositions though I mean there are a few exceptions the song flashback for example is a pretty cool little composition but you know for the most part it's it's some pretty cool texture some interesting sound play just to kind of fill in the gaps for for a soundtrack for a movie you know it's it's pretty much the reason why a lot of soundtrack music doesn't really speak to me because it feels like it's just kind of there to serve the purpose of enhancing the film you know though if you are a hardcore sort of day one OPN fan you probably will want to give this a shot this is some really gross nasty lo-fi underground grimy ass death metal it's got some nice spots I mean it's kind of short it's it's one-dimensional sure but it's it's it's nasty it's nasty it's got an attitude it's got a real nasty attitude and it will not check it it will not check that attitude it refuses to fuck you I don't know it's it's it's just so undefined you know there are some points when it seems like the band's music is pretty anthemic and and energetic and throttling like they come together with some tracks that would have sounded like you know some true arena sized indie bangers from the 2000s but a lot of the time I feel like the songwriting and the the sound of the instrumentals is just kind of bland and washed out and not really a lot of excitement being delivered here there are too many tracks on this thing as well like there's just way too much material here there is more sort of so-so material and there is great material on here I think there's most likely a decent album within this record if you sort of pared it down to the best of the best of the best the most memorable above the most memorable the most energetic of the most energetic tracks on here but I'm not really all that enthralled by a lot of the low-key cuts on here I feel like the band what little they have in the way of personality really kind of melts away as soon as you take the energy and you take the viscera out of the equation in my opinion but yeah they just don't really have that distinct of a sound they don't really have that distinct of a direction yeah they're really where their influence is on their sleeve in such a way where they're kind of drowning in them I mean it's it's it's just as bad as I anticipated so I guess it didn't underperform you could you could say that paint drying grass growing ice melting ASAP 12-year ABing it's it's just as entertaining as those three things he's he's so unexcited God to him it and this the the tracklist is a mess I think was just all over the place I mean sometimes it's super dreamy semi ambient sometimes it's kind of poppy sometimes it's kind of groggy sometimes it's super electronic but I guess kind of the thread that ties it all together is that it's very pleasant it's very mellow it's very easygoing however I wouldn't say it's it's terribly original or memorable from the sound of the production to the vocal style occasionally some lyrics stand out here and there but you know it's just kind of a very pleasant dreamy record not too much in the way of music or production tricks that are all that special in my opinion it's like every dream pop cliche from this decade sort of manifested onto one album most of these cliches are employed kind of well but they are cliches all the same pretty much everything I didn't really care for about emo and pop punk ten years ago manifesting itself on an album in 2017 it's pretty much pretty much the story with this one here dad at that data I know I know it's taken me a while to get to this thing I know and III have no excuse I have no excuse I just apologize okay I just apologize but unfortunately I don't know I'm just not really enjoying the sounds on this particular record you know they don't come off as harsh to me you know they seem a little in the yellow for like an experimental and a noise band I thought some of the tones on the opening track were just a little too smooth a little too clean you know I don't know man there was just something about the ferocity of white Suns previous work that was so exciting to me despite the fact that it was very you know very loose and very unpredictable and not very you know direct you know something very indirect about the band sound but it was still exciting you know it was still like like just making the hairs on the back of my neck stand up but that magic it doesn't really happen on this record I'm not getting the same visceral feel it just feels like I'm you know the the band's indirectness is making it difficult for me to connect with this album and the sound play just didn't come off as exciting to me but you know if you are looking for some experimental Noise music with a bit of a you know power electronics and a droning edge to it give this thing a shot it's it's pleasant it's for its pleasant for the most part very milky bass tones very dreamy it's almost like I'm listening to a goth album or a goth band try to write an album about the beach which sort of seems like counter to the to logic it's it's easy to listen to good luck remembering it though [Music] yep sounds sounds like a fall album and that's coming from somebody who generally likes the idea of a fall album it sounds like the fall album for a hard rock album a sound a style that's that's pretty much over at this point it's not bad the recordings good the energy is there the grooves are good some of the riffs are okay I guess it's just kind of a matter of whether or not you'd rather listen to somebody try to keep this style on life support or if you'd rather listen to you know one of Alice's older releases killer for example you know he's got a lot of great albums in the Canon yeah it's it's okay I don't know so many people were hyping this up to me like it was the best thing the band done in a while and in my opinion it's just as pristine and gutless and sanitary and uninteresting and just not risky at all and unadvised up until this point this is just another example to me of modern rock bands just not having a lot of bite not having a lot of guts not having a lot of just electricity sort of running through their recordings it just seems really safe just seems really predictable I wanna like this album I wanna like this album I really wanna like it but I don't know I'm just not really that into the vocals they're just not really doing anything for me to be completely honest yeah they're just not and the techno instrumentals I feel it could have been a bit more interesting could have been a bit more detailed could have could have been a bit more something you know I just feel like there's not a lot for me to sink my teeth into occasionally a groove and a vocal melody come together in a way that that is sort of captivating but for the most part it just seems very very oblique and I don't know very amateurish and not in a very endearing way I can't tell if Mogwai is getting slightly better or slightly slightly worse or just doing roughly the same I mean there are a few surprises on this album but for the most part I mean they're just kind of delivering another helping a very serene building beautiful trying to be inspiring instrumental rock that's very smooth that's very pretty um I don't know I I guess I was just hoping for more variation more bite more adventure more anything I mean at this point Mogwai is kind of

0evHtpLFM9k,I look like hipster garbage hi everyone hipster garbage here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new LCD soundsystem album American Dream this is the latest full-length album from one of my favorite bands of all time LCD Soundsystem New York indie tronic and dance Punk legends who dropped three pretty incredible records from 2005 to 2010 their self-titled sound of silver this is happening their final album there coincided with a huge send-off a farewell tour a movie documenting the band's last days and that last show at Madison Square Garden that they performed LCD Soundsystem and their front man and mastermind - James Murphy gave the band a really grand exit wrapped up in a very bittersweet bow while it was sad and it was sort of aggravating that the band had to end so prematurely leaving it at three great albums is certainly better than continuing to force it and then just drop mediocre material from there on out but then in 2015 the announcement came the LCD soundsystem was in fact getting back together they couldn't even go a full decade broke it up and in the wake of the band reassembling there's been a lot of skepticism aggravation and excitement - and I felt all three but no matter what my feelings on the band reassembling are I mean James Murphy could show up at my place at 3:00 a.m. and say you and if the album ended up being good I mean I'd have to forgive him for it because it's it's the album's good however that's not what I was expecting given the teaser tracks to this album called the police and American Dream the former kicked off like a really a verge new order song and the lyrics to me felt like a really weak attempt to trying to construct some sort of socio-political commentary the messaging of the track just seemed really vague kind of dabbling in like violent revolution like the act of calling the police is some sort of challenge to anybody who would question or stand in the way of James Murphy and whoever he imagines getting together with him to I don't know like destroy the powers that be or eat the rich but my primary issue with the track is that the longer it went on the more I felt like I was just kind of sitting in a bathtub that was growing cold and dirtier because in my opinion the band didn't really bring the progression the clarity the sharpness and the spunk that I enjoyed on their previous releases so much American Dream felt similarly underwhelming to me it is a slow burner of the highest order however in the context of the track listing I do think it's a pretty good ballad I like the Weeping elongated synth leads on the track when I first heard them I liked them even more with repeated listens and in my opinion the track features one of the most compelling vocal performances on the entire record and lyrically the track seems to be about like a revolution that never happened like somebody who thought that they were going against the grain but instead we're just kind of getting wrapped up in haze of drugs and hookups and now in light of kind of missing this wave this protagonist here is just going to kind of give up on fixing the world and being a better person and just kind of become a miserable loser maybe the song American dream hit me harder in the long run than called the police did because the revolutionary fantasy of that track doesn't hit as hard as the sad reality of this one and the song tonight another single a lot like call the police starts off well enough the instrumental is laced with these talkbox vocals these fluttering rhythm guitars a gurgling synth bassline but the groove doesn't really develop into anything exciting to borrow a lyric from the track it feels like forever and the lyrics on the track take a bit of a Chop Suey approach a lot like songs such as pow pow in their back catalogue James Murphy sings about death and artists obsessing about death embarrassing images and factoids about oneself lasting forever online James lyrics make some decent and smart observations yes but I feel like he undermines much of what he's saying with this little aside that he throws into the song randomly James once again reminding us that he's losing his edge here but at this point I don't think he's losing it he's kind of completely lost it he's totally through the process of losing it and it is now gone because he's the snobby judgemental record store employee that society has no use for anymore partially because he cast himself and his band into the used bin before anyone had even really decided whether or not they were done with them and now he's popping back up as if the world wasn't just going to move on and while most people did Indy being the dead end that it was has kind of left an unacknowledged void that nobody is really filling so it's almost like LCD soundsystem with this record is coming back around to provide comfort food for people who can't accept the fact that it's over and I have to stress the the point in the description of this album as comfort food because I don't really feel like anything James and the band have presented here is all that challenging or fierce or progressive James himself seems to admit this on the track change your mind where he goes on to say that he's not as dangerous as it used to be he doesn't really have anything else to say and nowhere on this album is that clearer than on the song how do you sleep which at its beginning sound pretty interesting I mean it has some murky tones some springy echoed spacious percussion sounds like the start of a cool Joy Division track and then the track grows into this sprawling whiny musical exorcism where James Murphy is just like I don't know moaning in this really angsty way about the deterioration of his friendship and business partnership with DFA co-founder tim Goldsworthy obviously Tim played a very big role in James life in the success of the label but I don't know just the way that these emotions play out on this track it's really obnoxious and it's not a good look the tracks airy and very patient build-up is not really that interesting the beat that eventually busts in sounds like a leftover from their last album and this track is not the only moment on this record where I catch like a hint of deja vu a lot of the instrumentals on this thing feel like warmed-over ideas from the band's previous efforts but complemented with these really washed out echoey mixes so that they don't sound like they're kind of perfectly repeating themselves over again which might be one of the worst things about this album because the sound of an LCD Soundsystem song used to be colorful vibrant amazing vivid orally American Dream is just like average I feel almost like they've reverted back to the production quality of their debut record which honestly in terms of just structuring the instrumentation and how the band would kind of pace pieces of instrumentation out as a song grows and progresses was much smarter for example on the song emotional haircut the flat bass the distant drums the reverb II vocals everything in this mix sounds so plain James Murphy's attention to detail and his incredible talent as a producer used to be LCD Soundsystem's greatest asset and now it just doesn't seem to be benefiting them for whatever reason on this album like on the intro track Oh baby which is one of the most tepid beginnings and build ups to any LCD Soundsystem track ever I feel like I'm listening to a version of dance yourself clean that never actually like gets fun and I cannot stand these vapid break-up lyrics Jesus Christ all of the odd beautiful tension that the suicide song that this track is obviously referencing is kind of gone James Murphy essentially replaces it with I don't know just sad desperation and a lack of expectations weirdly enough it's some of the darker and moodier songs in the track listing here that really ended up impressing me like the song I used to it's a very somber track with eerie sense and these shimmering stuttering rhythm guitars the track features one of the most weary and depressing vocal performances on the entire record which for LCD soundsystem is kind of a refreshing change of pace because there is kind of an emotional weight to this track that feels kind of new to the band this feeling this despondency is also kind of repeated on the incredibly sad closer black screen which is a tribute to the friendship that James had running with David Bowie before he passed away there's a lot of regret in the lyrics on this track James essentially singing about how he looked up to him and how he wished he had made more of an effort to connect with Bowie and make the best of their friendship I think the minimal electronic soundscape approach to the track was a good idea however I feel like this song succumbs to a lot of the same subpar musical progressions and mixing that many other tracks on this record do I mean some of the synth leads on this track just sound like they're fumbling as if they're like I don't know somebody in the dark looking for a light switch though I do like the very sad piano passages that kind of take the track out I don't know I mean I'm pretty disappointed by this album to be completely honest I don't know what kind of mental gymnastics James put himself through to psych him out of continuing with LCD soundsystem in 2010 it's like he was scared of making the band's worst album or making music that was no longer in the spirit of what the band originally stood for and despite every attempt at avoiding it that's exactly what the band does here still James and company are able to must a handful of decent tracks they maintain a lot of their musical fundamentals but this record is so obviously off the mark and the only way that I could feel any other way about that is if I just gave in blindly to the hype I know a band is significant and as smart and as interesting and as fantastic as LCD soundsystem only comes along once a decade and I'm totally fine with that I'm totally fine with that so I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just look an angry comment in the comments if you're angry okay that's the healthy way to deal with these things over here next to my head is I believe my review

_AkWW9kFFQM,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and worst

reviewed on the youtube channel as well as you know gear speakers turntable stuff for the budding record collector and audiophile in your life maybe it's also you so you know spoil yourself treat yourself and you know help the channel at the same time as well all right let's get into the worst tracks of the week mmm it's funny that I just got rid of that picture of Taylor Swift's album because I was talking about it last week but of course we're talking about it again because Taylor Swift just dropped a new track I was gonna record this video earlier but good thing I didn't because if I did I wouldn't have listened to this track yet and Taylor Swift new song ready for it easily the worst track I've heard this week this song is hot garbage and this song is exactly what I predicted weeks ago on social media and maybe even on my youtube channel too and that is that Taylor Swift goes trap on this new song this track has a lumbering heavy bombastic trap beat it kind of has this weird distorted bass line at the start of it that reminded me of like yeezus I'm like okay is she like is she really traffic like god this sounds like something off of yeezus the hell and then once the beat pops in you get the rattling trap hi-hats Taylor Swift starts you know talk singing and this really sort of like then a name name name you know there's kind of a very snobbish sort of tone tour delivery it's pretty gross very unlikable and I don't know it's it seems like a bunch of top 40 cliches just bottled into one single song there's literally nothing special or memorable memorable about it it seems like a Frankenstein monster of some of the most formulaic songs have heard over the past couple of years I mean as you know I guess as underwhelming as her last single was like at least there was a coherent hook to it at least there was kind of a song structure that made sense and was enjoyable about it can't really say that about this new song at all and the next song I want to mention in this segment is the brand new track from Tegan and Sara and Matthew dear unfortunately this new one over here titled bad ones is I don't know it's it's kind of like everything that I haven't enjoyed about Tegan and Sara's recent but but just kind of topped with a somewhat better instrumental I really don't know you know I don't know what Matthew Deere has to gain out of this collaboration honestly like it's not the dark sexy sleek funky production and songwriting that I've enjoyed and many of his fans I've enjoyed from him in the past instead we're kind of getting I don't know some some mediocre MySpace pop yeah all right let's move on to the tracks that it was kind of met on tracks that I wanted to mention wasn't amazed by them but you know I thought they were certainly worth shouting out pointing uh some attention to new yung lean track this new young lean track surprisingly like of course it's young lean I kind of had an initial reaction to it like it's a young lean track I'm no good like it it's titled red bottom sky but honestly like I think there are a lot of cool things about this track I kind of like the weird electronic very I don't know information age aesthetic of the track like this song to me seems like so Internet age it seems so Internet music and um I think the lead vocal melody on the hook is kind of nice like it's a decent ballad with a weird new agey you know very internet aesthetic you know it's not a perfect song and I do think it drags on after a while but it's it's not a bad tune it's not a bad track the new Wolf Parade track is a Dan Buettner Beckner song if I'm pronouncing his last name correctly I'm probably not it's very driving it's very tense it's got a pretty um I want to say amped hook to it you know it's it's it's not one of my favorite songs he's written for the band but it certainly continues down this path that the band's recent output has been that they're kind of getting their energy back they're getting back in their groove they're getting their mojo back and I don't know the recent material has been pretty exciting you know pretty exciting in my opinion along with the new national material as well this new national track titled day I died it's definitely one of the more engaging ballads that I've heard so far in this recent crop of tracks I actually think this new album shaping up to be their most interesting since boxer and you know after the second chorus the song does kind of drag on a little bit like the band doesn't offer much more in the way of like excitement or variation past that point but I still think it's a pretty decent ballad I want to give a shout out to the good people over at kero kero bonito who have a new Asus cover out for the song rock and roll star it's not bad you know not the best production I've heard on their work as of yet and I don't know if you know their style completely you know I guess transitions into this songwriting style but it's actually not a bad cover at all not a bad cover john mouse has a new project on the way and this new song that I'm talking about here from it is title the combine I think the vocals leave a little bit to be desired on this one but if we're talking merely from an instrument instrumental standpoint on this thing it's like a cool mini little synth opus like some of the harmonies and chord progressions on this track are actually pretty beautiful and the way that the song is structured is it's kind of epic at points as well like definitely not the super post punky dark and weird I guess um I don't know dark wavy cynthy you know it's it's so difficult to sort of pin down Mouse's music because there's so many styles that are flowing through it and it's not entirely one thing and I would say that's even the case on this new track over here but if you've heard his work in the past it's not it's not like that you know obviously there are aesthetic similarities here you know it's it's somewhat low Phi there is kind of a retro futuristic quality to the production and just the sound of the analog synthesizers on this track but what he's doing here just seems like much more instrumentally driven very epic very grand almost as if it's like inspired by classical music a little bit so give it a shot it's a good track also want to shout out this new father John misty remix over here by the haxon cloak I think the start of it is a little underwhelming but the intensity of the editing and the music video combined with the you know kind of heavy droney latter half of the remix of this song you know things that would have been helpful and over for the revolution is actually pretty powerful so I give this remix a shot I want to shout out this new track from the cool kids it's not my favorite single that I've heard from this new crop of tracks off of their forthcoming record special edition grand master deluxe it's titled 9:15 p.m. I think you know the verses on it are cool the beat has kind of a somewhat vintage yet modernized West Coast smooth kind of groove to it I don't know it's it's a track that does not feel like it's as quirky or as much of a banger as the recent crop of singles but um it's it's definitely a track that could grow on me as I listened to the record more you know sort of anticipating a bit of a slow burn or kind of situation here let's talk about the tracks that I felt were the best of the week first I got to give a shout out to the project by Muay drugs which is a new project featuring Denmark Vesey and I don't want to mess up this individuals name so I will get this correctly it is a new hip hop project featuring Denmark Vesey Detroit rapper and producer as well as as arias who is also a producer and together they come together I'm saying together they come together they come together with yes and BAE aka mos def on this new track over here and it's titled by my app and it's actually like a really cool hard-hitting very textured industrial hip-hop banger with like I don't know like a drum circle kind of quality to the groove and the percussion and the instrumental like there's so much going on and the vocal performance is on this track are so amped they're so energetic it's kind of hard not to get excited about what they're doing here and yeah they have a new project coming on the way very soon hit the link down there in the description you could see the premiere that we did for this track over on the website next I got to give it I got to give a shout out to this new Zola Jesus track this new song is titled syphon and it's very unlike a lot of the recent singles that have dropped for this forthcoming album she is dropping very soon it has kind of a I don't know it's it's almost a little too straightforward or at least more straightforward than we would expect a Zola's usual ballads to be and there's kind of this uplifting almost hopeful kind of quality to the song as well that I thought was like a nice change of pace and it turns out that the song is like in tribute to a friend of hers who tried to commit suicide and with that in mind when you read into some of the lyrics you know especially like the very dark mantra around like the middle point in the second half about like you know not letting this person bleed out it's um it's pretty sick it's pretty intense and but yet also again hopeful and beautiful and eerie you know the the emotions of this track they're all over the place obviously you're dealing with the darkness of this person kind of being in a state of mind where they want to end their life but also there's kind of a note of positivity there where it's almost like she's trying to be supportive be inspiring be there to help motivate this person to go on again it's it's a mixed bag of emotions I think that kind of makes it unique and you know obviously the balladry of the song is very beautiful I don't know man I I feel like this song is yet to kind of fully reveal itself to me all I know so far is that I think it sounds really good and you know it's a one of the more unique singles that I've heard from her ever but certainly one of the most unique singles from this a new album cycle that she has going I want to give a shout out to the world is a beautiful place that have a new track out titled Tigers what is it Tiger Marine Tigers and definitely not as punchy and his pop punky in a straightforward and as simple as the last single a drop from this album which I don't know kind of let a lot of people down for whatever reason I thought the track was good I thought the track was exciting I thought it was a cool change of pace however this new song over here goes back to their grand epic post rock infused emo kind of aesthetic and honestly I like it a lot you know it's certainly more subtle in nuance than a lot of the instrumentation from their past couple of records and structurally the song is very immense it's very powerful and I don't know man I like the vocals on the track as well so give this track a listen it's very epic it's very uh I want to say I don't know has a nice ascension to it I want to give a shout out to this new track toe to toe x' which is off of a forthcoming Mastodon EP it's just four tracks but honestly like I like this new song quite a bit like this new track to me beats out pretty much every song from the new album and yet there are elements from the last album on this you know some of those hardrock elements some of those more traditional and straightforward and more melodic metal elements and sort of alt metal elements I think show up in this track but Mastodon finds a way to fuse them with some heavier harder more Mastodon ish passages it does make the song feel like it's a little all over the place because it seems like Mastodon are constantly shifting and evolving and changing the vibe and the sound of the track numerous times but somehow it really comes together and those moments those really short catchy moments in the track that the band hits you with they really leave a huge impact and they really stuck with me even after a few listens you know there are some moments of this song that they're so short but the band manages to pull off something so catchy in that short amount of time before they sort of you know just drift off into something else you know actually really hard transition into something else and I don't know man I'm just kind of hoping the band comes back around again this is the first time the band has put out a record I thought was just okay or super mediocre and then all of a sudden they rubber band back into a direction that I enjoy much more so you know even though I was underwhelmed by the last record I'm not counting Mastodon out by any means because lo and behold they can drop a track like this so yeah I'm enjoying this cut this cut quite a bit as well as this new eBay II I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly this is the first time really kind of covering this duo this new song titled deathless featuring Kumasi Washington and what can I say about this I love the lurching very patient amazing drumming and percussion percussion percussion on this track the Li vocals are super soulful as well as you know just kind of catchy passionate the group vocals on the track make the song they're so huge they're so powerful and Kumasi Washington saxophones on this track sound amazing as well you know I've heard this duo's material before before I sort of saw the height but I wasn't crazy about it myself but I'm really seeing it on this new track over here like this new song is pretty much  amazing like it's a powerful track and you know very very forward-thinking very amazing organic instrumentation and again the group vocals and the saxophones are awesome like they're an amazing sound and they make the song so much moving on from there got to give a shout out to the new death from above track and single holy books this is death from above kind of playing to their strengths you got those driving drums you got the sharp lead vocals you got the massive distorted heavy driving bass riffs excuse me and it's hard hitting and then there's like you know nice kind of refined piano bridge that's very illustrious it's a very nice change of pace isn't quite as aggressive as the rest of the track and shows that the band has some nice dynamics um didn't feel like the band was completely like just throwing the baby out with the bathwater with you know the very funky groovy poppy track they dropped not too long ago you know this feels to me like death from above usual thing but kind of enhanced a little bit you know I'm not anticipating that the next record is gonna be amazing or anything like that you know could very much be a mixed bag like their comeback album but still you know it seems like they are not giving up they are continuing forward and you know with more music with more time to write with more time to practice with more time to play the potential for better ideas to come forward is most certainly there and it seems that that is in fact the case of this new track over here and I want to give a shout out also to the new Kurt Vile in Courtney Barnett or Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile track which is titled over everything they have a new collaborative record coming out this year given that I wasn't really big on Courtney's breakout record and kurz last record I wasn't sitting here thinking like oh this is a collaborative album I have to hear but honestly this new track they've dropped like I don't know it is man like curtain Cortney they have chemistry man like there's something very playful and kind of flirty and kind of silly and tongue-in-cheek and and outright funny you know subtly funny you know kind of like low-key funny but still funny funny about this new track over here and I'm hoping that I don't know they can kind of keep this energy going on this new album of theirs because I don't know man like they just work really well together and I feel like their Styles complement one another so um you know again while separately I haven't been crazy about the recent work this to me was like fireworks you know again in a subtle fashion but still and next I got to give a shout out to this new classics track over here which is a very bubbly fun one-off track that has some very rich pianos awesome house beats some amazing like choir vocal samples it's a really great dance track hopefully um you know the band's next record is or the duo's next record rather is a little bit more exciting than their last and Arielle pink I have to shout out as well has a new track out from his forthcoming project in another weekend this one titled ode to the go thank you this track is how to describe it I don't know it kind of feels like he's going back to his super quirky super odd like songwriting and production style to the point where he's like almost bordering on novelty music and not in a bad way you know this song is very very schmaltzy very very silly but still of course you know showcases Kurt knock her aerials attention to detail with production with instrumentation you know his funny I guess a lyrical point of view his vibrant and eccentric personality so it definitely give this track a shot it's one of my favorite singles so far from this forthcoming album and I'm really excited to review this LP and I have to give a shout out finally to Alex Cameron who has another track out from his forthcoming album running out of luck and if you remember recently he had a sort of duet track out with angel Olson that was amazing and you know thought that originally the song is good but maybe this is just kind of a bit of a fluke maybe this a bit of a one-off thing maybe I won't be that crazy about his forthcoming material and I was kind of ready I was in that mindset when I heard this new track over year like when it initially hit me I was like oh this just kind of sound like some plain ass like 80s rock pop revivalism or whatever and you know certainly it is that in a sense but as I listen to it more and more I was kind of taking in the songwriting and taking and um you know some of the interesting imagery coming up in his lyrics you know like about you know knuckles being bloody because he has like money in the trunk once I was kind of reading into some of the lyrics and I was kind of catching the the melodies and the awesome hook on this thing I was like okay you know there's something like a little there's something to this you know it reminded me a lot of some of the powerful and awesomely catchy and sharp songwriting that was like on a Brandon Flowers debut album if any of you sort of paid attention to that or followed that and I don't know I just really liked it a lot I'm kind of excited to hear not only him but just kind of more Australian singer songwriters like coming out and killing it and yeah that's it guys those are all the songs that I wanted to mention in this video again they're all linked down there in the description box make sure to check out especially the tracks that I recommend it to you guys but you know also the tour link because we have those tour dates coming up the amazon associates link the turntable lab link is well but again especially the

gUbedU__lM0,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our monthly great album segment it is now September so I want to blow through or sort of go back over the album's in August that grabbed my attention that I thought were great that I thought were worth re recommending to you guys just in case anything slipped through the cracks all of these albums the reviews for them are linked down there in the description box let's go new o'seas album ork this is a blistering fun creative and dynamic psych garage punk album with lots of instrumental color some very muscular musical performances the band sounds like a well-oiled machine on this thing the riffs are fantastic the drumming is energetic and propulsive and John Dwyers lead vocals have a lot of character they're very gruff cartoony weird strange the o'seas continue to go down this sort of dark cavernous winding tunnel of madness and fun with this newer album over here next got a shout out the new Brock Hampton album saturation - West Coast hip hop collective Brock Hampton have done it again with a very good collection of songs that pretty much follows the formula of saturation 1 they have saturation 3 coming out later this year so they're really kind of hitting us with a lot of material but there's still a lot of very slick instrumental some very catchy hooks some very charismatic funny tongue-in-cheek and entertaining verses from Kevin abstract merlin amir dom freaking Joba just everybody everybody who's on this thing that champion everybody I didn't think it was like you know the bomb drop the refreshing sort of like whoa this is totally crazy a new an awesome exciting feel of saturation one but you know it's still a solid project give it a listen still very good next richard Dawson peasant this guy's an English folk singer and songwriter who I don't know like his sound is just really experimental and odd and there's something kind of almost medieval about his lyrics his poetry some of the melodies that he chooses like there's a very old English folk sort of vibe and sentiment to a lot of what he does on this record the songs have multiple phases they're creatively written creatively structured and the recording is really kind of low fie and noisy nutty and interesting I think this album is incredibly beautiful easily one of my favorite records of the year but still you know there are some things that are really kind of strange and mystical about it and difficult to put my finger on you know there's a very odd Beauty to this album that I don't think is gonna appeal to everyone but it certainly has appealed to me and I think it's amazing want to also shout out the new Oxbow album thin black Duke took me a while to wrap my mind around this one but I still think it is one of the best experimental rock records of the year very heavy lavish lush and beautiful instrumentation on this thing some good guitar riffs a very painful sort of sense of moodiness to the instrumentals on this thing that I just could not shake from track to track to track and Eugene the band's frontman his vocals are incredibly versatile amazing he's all over the place stylistically emotionally I don't know man it's it's just a hell of a record and I also want to put on blast the new Dying Fetus album wrong one to with probably the best brutal death metal album you're gonna hear this year god it is blistering and hard-hitting and ugly and raw also I want to shout out the new Ke$ha album rainbow which I thought was a very pretty and a very righteous and very well put together in a creative pop album easily her best record yet really kind of coming into her own as a singer and a songwriter on this one definitely not the Annoying club' experience that I had in the past with her work and finally I want to shout out the new dead cross album itself titled Mike Patton and the gang on this one essentially come together to make a hardcore punk album there are a few flubs on here but you know for the most part they approach the style with a ton of creativity and obviously fantastic musicianship and we're gonna leave it there those are all the records I wanted to recommend to you guys again all the reviews link down there in the description check them out and hopefully you guys enjoy this stuff let me know down in the comments what were some of your favorite projects in August and here September let's go let's go September yeah transition have you given any of these albums listen did you love them did you hate them what would you rate them you're the best or the best which should I review next hit the like you like please subscribe and please don't cry in the comments just be angry somewhere else like in real life you know just punch a pillow or something will ya over here next to my head one of the videos one of the reviews that I have for one of the album's I mentioned in this video or you know you can click on our playlist to check out the other great albums recommendation videos that I've come out with over the years and that's it guys I will catch you in the next video forever 
e1iCnyireF8,ah hi everyone earth in the up Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new war on drugs album a deeper understanding this is the fourth full-length album from the war on drugs a musical project spearheaded by singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist Adam granduciel and up until this point Adam in the war have forged a pretty unique sound that somehow sits at the crossroads of folk rock of psychedelic rock and the driving repetition of krautrock it's like listening to the Heartland anthems of Bruce Springsteen but awash in the atmosphere of a modern shoegaze band but like with a touch of Noi or maybe like some Bob Dylan highway 61 revisited especially on the band's last album lost in the dream which in my opinion has been their best release to date and why don't I do enjoy the pillowy uplifting blissful aesthetic of this record the war on drugs are yet to really wow me on an album like from beginning to end I think they have a cool aesthetic but there's just something that's always kind of I don't know just like missing for me some of the experiments don't seem all that thrilling sometimes the band's sound is a little one-dimensional or the songwriting and singing can be a little average which I sort of anticipated would be the case with this new record over here because not many of the new singles have really stuck with me however I did notice that it seemed like there was kind of a newfound clarity to the war on drugs sound like Adams vocals were a lot more upfront and clear and I don't know maybe with this record Adam and the band could really like up and the group sound and just go for something totally different maybe for the better but I I don't think that that's the case with this new project unfortunately while adam has always been technically the frontman of the war on drugs he really puts himself in that position on this record he really puts himself in those shoes however I don't really feel like he completely fills them I don't think his whispery dylan-esque singing is really all that captivating the most emotionally stirring moment on the entire record vocally was probably the closer you don't have to go his singing seem just a tad more expressive here but it could also be because of me getting caught up in the very rich and kind of righteous piano chord progression here regardless its kind of too little too late at this point at the very end of the album and nor do adam's lyrics thrill me on a lot of this record like when he really kind of brings the instrumentation back puts a spotlight on himself on the song knocked down far away there is a star raining through the night sky like a drop give them all a piece of the Moon for me somehow I can make it rain diamonds in the night sky I'm like a child and now I'm beaten up and weak I don't know it just kind of reads to me like a lot of cliched nature imagery that doesn't add up to a whole lot it's not very specific it's not very detailed that's not very evocative it's not very direct in its storytelling either which is completely fine not necessarily a bad thing but if you're gonna go in a more abstract direction like at least make your word choices interesting and there are also a lot of moments on this record where the war on drugs sound comes off a little less psychedelic and trippy and washed out and more like a grand eighties Rock production wrapped up with a really bright sheen on it I mean the opening bars of the song nothing to find sound like the exhilarating start to a synth pop song out of the New Wave era which is a really thrilling moment on the album however this cleanliness this more synthetic and I guess tangible direction doesn't necessarily add up to great tunes like the introductory track up all night which sounds so stiff and so chopped up that it's like I'm just listening to a bunch of watery piano and drum loops it's like I'm listening to Adams sort of stuck in the middle of a broken record or something it's just really kind of hard to get lost in the groove of this one which for the war on drugs is kind of a bad sign but this intro track is really kind of the exception to the majority of the album where the instrumentation does typically flow very well it's a good groove sounds very natural you get some nice chemistry and energetic momentum melodies that are like sweet and crisp like an apple in the fall the song pain the song holding on the song in Chains as well which in my opinion could have slid pretty seamlessly into the tracklist of the band's last record nice tracks for me are really high points on the album where Adam and the band kind of loses me is when they really kind of turn things down and try to mellow it out a bit too much rely on Adams balladry his voice his lyrics his songwriting a bit too much like on the 11 minute thinking of a place like it's Pleasant but a few minutes in I'm kind of looking for the door the track really could have ended right after that weirdly awkward loud guitar solo that seemed really unsure of itself like it didn't know what note it wanted to play next not often I hear a guitar solo that feels like that but no it just keeps going on and on and on and it is pleasant but not not much is going on I'm equally unenthused by another ballad on here clean living which doesn't justify its six minute runtime it's almost half as long as thinking of a place and yet it feels as long you know overall this album was really just kind of okay I'm indifferent toward it really despite a handful of decent songs and the track listing because the tracks that really stood out to me and spoke to me the most on this album didn't really bring anything to the table that some of my favorite cuts from slave ambient or lost in the dream didn't already not only are they recycling ideas that have already been proven to work from their past records and not really changing them up all that much but on this thing they've kind of shown their inability to work outside of their comfort zone effectively and this newfound emphasis on the vocals and the lyrics on this record shows really just how lacking they are on this record the war on drugs may be big on sound but they're kind of small on substance I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition next hit the like

LG9gDRVM6QQ,hi everyone don't don't hear the Internet's business music never and it's time for view of the brand-new o'seas album orc this is the latest full-length LP from garage site punks psych garage punk site punks psych garage garage punk psych punk band VOCs or know that on this record there just o'seas but yes Oh Sees keeping it ever prolific here with another record quickly following up a pretty nice album and EP release that they dropped in 2016 if you remember the band's last album a weird exits was actually really good in my opinion easily one of the Bands best albums in a long time I thought the production quality on this LP was a lot better than some of the band's past work and also a lot of these cuts were based on these very tight energetic quirky instrumental jams some of the best performances I think the OCS have laid to tape now in odd entrances I thought was a kind of mild follow-up EP not quite as exciting not quite as full throttle but definitely as strange and this new album over here ork while it doesn't seem like directly connected to a weird exits it doesn't feel like a sister album or anything like that still the album is very much in the same spirit delivering tons of weird winding instrumental jams that kind of send a shock to the system the song the static god that kicks the entire record off has an amazing driving drum be sinister vocals that sound like they're being delivered by like a I don't know like a an orc the very same like weird creature depicted on the front cover of this thing or like maybe an annoying bridge troll that asks you to like you know answer riddles before you cross the river there's this amazing wailing wall of layered guitars that not only starts the song off but sort of guides the track through one jammed passage after another I mean the band is already topping the points of intensity on their last full length at just the start of the album it's a good sign also I kind of like the blissful epic keyboard bridge in latter half of this track two shows that the band is getting like a little bit more dynamic and versatile as they go in this direction night expose a much shorter track that is a lot more aggressive roaring guitars all over this thing some kind of weird funky strange keyboard leads that kind of kick the song off some of the synth leads get kind of squelchy like they're doing some I don't know weird analog synth experimentation like some knob turning the song animated violence takes things into a heavy psych direction the riffs get really loud really droney really fuzzy these riffs trade off with some pretty cool lead guitar passages the vocals are like really deep and monstrous the band works in like a really strange chilly organ bridge and they bring the jam down to a nice simmer right before they go full throttle right at the finish of the song the song keys to the castle has one of the most sharp turns on the entire record it has this really dense aggressive two-minute performance right at the start of the track and then all of a sudden it breaks off into this like serene funky I don't know instrumental passage that like lasts the remaining six minutes of the song with kind of these uh droning fluttering violins very nice relaxing gentle piano keys it's like being cast out into a barren desert suddenly in the middle of the album but in the best way possible the song jettison features these creepy whispered lead vocals that are oddly sensual drenched in echo and pair very well with the improvised drum breaks the song also features tons of these like treble e sunburned distorted hard rock riffs and the song paranoids brings the intensity of the album way down to a minimum this is like the most abstract the album gets much of the song is kind of dominated by these weird noisy hissing sounds and a steady drumbeat weird guitar improv and sound effects kind of orbit around this beat in this hissing noise it like really reminds me of like some early noi or can it's really intriguing there's not a whole lot of variation to it it does have an explosive finish though I will say I don't think the band draws this experimentation out too long it's just long enough to serve as a decent strange satisfying interlude you know overall is really impressed with this album really excited by this album I think it's a vast improvement on their last record granted there was a song or two that I thought was maybe a little bit too long like keys to the castle or the song Knight Expo I think had a little bit more potential to it than the band fully realized the song cooling tower I mean I do like a lot of the characteristics of this song I kind of like the quirky background vocals the funky bass and drum groove the humming keyboards on this thing but it doesn't really assemble into an exciting performance or song and the tracklist it just kind of feels like an overextended motif and raw optics as a closer it does have a decent ending at the very finish of the song and it kicks off pretty well even though I mean if the start were merely an instrumental that was deeper in the tracklist here I wouldn't have found it to maybe be the most distinct in the bunch the most memorable in the bunch but we're really kind of separates the song out is that there is this long solo drum part like right in the middle the track that's actually pretty fun I wish more bands did stuff like this especially since the drumming is pretty groovy it's pretty cool it's very entertaining to listen to I'm not saying it's like the most muscular flashy drumming on the planet but it did make for a nice change of pace and for better or for worse does make raw Optics a unique point in the tracklist so I don't know I mean it's not a perfect record but the OCS continued to experiment and improve upon what they've been doing as of late and the band sounds so cohesive and together as they kind of embark on this variety of instrumental bits that I don't know it just kind of sounds like they're just a really well oiled machine I'm feeling a strong eight to a light nine on this thing transition have you given something we'll listen did you love it to Jahannam what would you rate here the best you the best which should I review next that they'll like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments

qbh0s7OCZOE,hey everyone don't even hear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ASAP mob album slash mixtape cozy tapes vol 2 - cozy ASAP mob New York rap collective they are back with a new sizable full-length project following up Lords never worried from several years ago as well as cozy tapes one and honestly going into this thing I wasn't really expecting all that much not just because the group's two previous efforts were at best mediocre and at worst completely unlistenable but also because ASAP mob I've come to the conclusion that they are easily the most overrated rap crew in hip-hop history collectively they've never had a good or solid project they don't really as a group have a cohesive sound or style up until this point they've shown very little in the way of like collective artistic chemistry only a select few of the members of the group are actually like entertaining to listen to ASAP nast ASAP ant ASAP 12 e you might as well take a sleeping pill when you listen to these dudes and good luck telling them apart most of the time - and the mobs relevancy thrives mostly on the individual relevancy of their biggest members rocky and Ferg and now playboy cardi who I actually forgot was like even sort of a part of the ASAP mob when tracks like Magnolia we're doing numbers now this thing is 17 tracks long there are a couple skits in here and only a few real true blue bangers and songs that are actually worth returning to a formidable chunk of these songs are just outright skippable in fact that's kind of the case for the first leg of the tape parry a which is sloppy messy slow and pointless doesn't have any excitement to it nothing in the way of an impressive verse it's like the worst opening track the song blowing Minds instrumentally sounds like I don't know some leftover playboy cardi song that really playboy cardi should have been the only person on this and yet it's like he's the least attention-grabbing person on it this is actually one of a few moments on here it feels like the mob collectively is trying to hop on Carty sound and like get themselves more attention or sound better by way of it there's also the song Black Card where I mean ASAP rocky does kind of do a I don't know a bit of a cool lingual thing where he's you know overusing the word black and talking about a variety of black things but it's mostly an unfinished track that doesn't really have a strong hook on it defined ending and the song please shut up the hook on this thing please shut up please shut up please this is easily one of the dumbest hooks I've heard not just this year but probably this decade you know that and I just wanna be a friend a lot of these tracks like barely qualify as songs it's like we're getting a bland forgettable beat a hook that was sort of conceived in a matter of moments just totally thrown together and then it's like I don't know a mismatched random grab bag of whatever a member of ASAP mob wants to hop on the track and throw together like a really casual verse like the most casual imaginable I'm starting to think that cozy is like code word for lazy on this thing because the cozier this tape gets the more low effort it seems it's to the point where Rocky's charisma can barely even make up for the the lack of actually catchy and memorable lines on this thing I mean some of this flows are kind of cool but I mean he's working with some pretty subpar beats and hooks on this thing and without good beats and hooks rocky is I don't know like a mannequin with no clothes on it Ferg comes off pretty wild and eccentric on a few of these cuts and that's a good thing but there are a few moments here and there where he like slips back into kiss and pink feature levels of cringe like at the start of his walk on water feature somehow cozy tapes to comes together a little bit at the midpoint of the project and deliver some songs that are at least listenable structured a little better and even good the very dreary and dark get the bag has some decent flows on it the pacing is pretty good and it's very engaging throughout the song Bahamas in my opinion is the best track on the entire project I love the hook and this sort of refrain and this idea of not having been to the Bahamas it's pretty funny and this is kind of like the wild unpredictable energy that if you were going to do a tape and do a project with a group of guys that sounded very on the fly this is the kind of energy you would want to capture right here on this song and yet so many tracks on this thing just fall flat and are just severely boring but not only is the lyrical energy and the performance energy high on this thing a little yachty and schoolboy q in a lot of ways kind of make the track the instrumental is fantastic sounds really woozy kind of like a trap nightmare and it's that kind of Spacey woozy surreal quality that I think has made some of Rockies and Ferg's and ASAP mobs best tracks as great as they are it's something that I think they do well it's a sound that I think they helped popularize it's a sound that I wish they would just focus on because every single time they sort of you know hit that pocket strike that balance on a sound just like this it goes over so well because as soon as they step outside of this comfort zone you have tracks like frat rules which is a sharper sweeter more conventional song with some very soulful horn samples throughout the beat does get kind of redundant but the flows are good however the song just kind of sounds like a Big Sean song not only in tone but in the fact that Big Sean just really dominates the track and that's another thing like a lot of the guests on this thing really tend to steal away from the rest of the ASAP mob that maybe because they're making so many concessions on a song that they're essentially just kind of allowing it to be their song just to break up the monotony of the project or it could just simply be because you know the other people appearing on the project are more talented which is exactly what happens on the track toward the tail end of this thing where it's essentially just members of pro era and Flatbush zombies all just like you know in a posse cut which is pretty great it's like one of the most exciting tracks on the entire thing here but it's also really good because there's like little to no ASAP mob presence like your project literally gets better the less that you're on it I mean also kind of the same thing with the song RAF or RAF I love the sad pretty beat on here it's very entrancing and the vocal contributions from quavo and Frank Ocean are again kind of showstoppers even little Lucifer on here is not all that bad considering you know his company with the ASAP mob on this thing moments like this blow out of the water tracks that are merely just listenable like a first year being rich and I don't know man I I feel like the ASAP mob just continues to have very little to offer mostly because they just refused to offer it if we're to make some kind of school metaphor over here given the skits on this tape I mean ASAP mob they merely seem only concerned with just passing their classes by the skin of their teeth just taking that d+ and just getting through whatever because the lyrics on this thing are forgettable the rapping is subpar to average the production mostly very bland the hooks most of the time what hooks and the mob still offers very little in the way of style and vision I don't know if that's just because they don't have it and will never have it or if they just haven't put in the work and the effort to actually come together with one once again the ASAP mob have dropped a project that is very inconsistent and very unremarkable and I'm feeling a decent strong four on this thing transition have you given this album a listen have you loved it have you hated it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit to like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comma in the comments if you're angry okay that's it guys over here next to my head is

q9yUTGIXRxM,hi everyone make sure to donate uses for the victims of Hurricane Harvey here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Queens of the Stone Age album villains Queens of the Stone Age is a long-running hard and alternative rock outfit that's been going about like 20 years strong now several years ago Josh Homme II and company dropped what I felt was one of the greatest records of the Bands career like clockwork a landmark moment an album that was filled with some pretty fantastic guest musicians Mark Lanegan Trent Reznor Dave Grohl was on here Elton John just to name a few not only that but the sound and the production of this album was immaculate one of the best sounding records from Queens of the Stone Age the guitars were so crisp and full and heavy and the bass sounded awesome that the tone of the guitars was great as well also the additional keyboards and pianos and backup vocalists created the sound that was just really thick and dense and beautiful and harmonious and kind of sad and weary I mean this was easily one of the Bands most despondent albums for sure and this vibe was matched up with some of Queens best songs in a long time while this thing was not as rambunctious as some of the Bands earlier stuff I mean it was still like a really well crafted album very moody a lot darker more instrumentally refined now how does a band follow an album like this up how does a band top such an album I I guess by not caring about topping it after the illustrious sonic adventure that Queens of the Stone Age took listeners on with their last record they seem to be throwing this whole thing in Reverse stripping things back going a bit more skeletal there are even some speedier and slightly more aggressive cuts on this thing to match this roar sound like the very jittery track head like a haunted house which sounds way amped like the band is about to snap one of my favorite cuts on this thing but the forlorn nature of like clockworks still sort of lingers on a handful of cuts from this record in fact I wouldn't be surprised if some of the cuts on this thing had been written around the time that the songs from like clockwork were written because I am getting some very similar vibes almost like some of the track on this thing are like in the same spirit but again what's changed and so drastically is kind of the sound and the production on this thing it's just a bit rougher a bit muddier in spots as well and I'm just not sure to what end it's an aesthetic change I don't think is going to WoW listeners who are coming down from the high of like clockwork especially when you have moments like the end of unrewarded n where there's actually kind of a cool sax part worked into the finish of the song but the mix is kind of so smothering and so tinny that you can't really get a grip of it I was surprised but then also not when I heard that Mark Ronson produced this thing because not only is he you know such a popular producer has produced you know a lot of great pop tracks that I enjoy so much however I sort of put two and two together the flat almost colorless and very bone-dry sound of this album kind of reminded me of what Mark had done on the Black Lips album Arabia Mountain which the production of that record was one of my least favorite things about it I do think the approach mark took to the sound of this album kind of saps the energy out of some of these cuts especially on the evil has landed to put this record kind of bluntly it just sounds like Queens of the Stone Age are taking it back to basics a little bit but with some sonic shortcomings there are some highlights in this thing like the incredibly funky opener feet don't fail me now which has the super danceable and killer bass and guitar riff I just can't not move to it the lyrics on this thing emphasize moving and dancing but also kind of using that as a metaphor for the like pace and challenges of life there are also some crazy lead melodies on this thing a really solid bridge and I also want to point out the eerily beautiful song fortress which i think is one of the most I don't know heartfelt and mature songs the band has ever put together I mean this song has some of the best lyrics I've ever heard on a Queens of the Stone Age track this whole idea of being someone's refuge giving someone an emotional fortress of sorts when there's crumbles the song is so good and it's so beautiful and it's such a nice ballad at its core that I kind of wish it made it onto like clockwork we have the multi-faceted and very lengthy Unruh born again which kind of has this manic sort of unsettling vocal delivery the lyrics to me feel kind of like a torture chamber of dark sexual and druggie imagery a lot of mentions of kind of the the the devil sort of altering your perception or I guess evil altering your perception I guess in in this attempt to seek out the Fountain of Youth in my opinion this cut and sort of the lyrical themes in it truly embody the cover of the record and the song moves through a lot of cool awesome passages I mean the string break down toward the end a solid bridge on this thing as well there's a really weird like keyboard jam in the midst of the song that's pretty cool however there are still some cuts that did really underwhelmed me not just because of the production I mean the the way you used to do is still sort of I don't know a bit of a lukewarm cut in my opinion I thought the songs sounding like some very moody ZZ Top run off to my years would eventually just kind of wear off and the track would grow on me once I heard it on the album itself but not really it's it's just kind of soso to me the main riff on domesticated animals reeds is like a little too stiff in my opinion I'm not exactly sure if the tension that I feel like the band is trying to put into this song would have been helped if the sound was just a little bit more high fidelity a bit fuller the track doesn't really come to life for me until we get this like immensely dark and powerful wall of guitars that that really kind of fills out the the latter chunk of the track Josh's vocals also kind of hit a passion peak at this point in the song too we have the song hideaway which is easily the most forgettable cut in the track listing here easily the most mild song in the whole record and to be honest outside of the driving proggy finish of the closing track on here villains of circumstance this song is like one of the draba struts that Queens of the Stone Age have ever written and recorded like not only does it not really justify its length but the chord progressions are so cliched at points the vocal melodies are lifeless and totally uninteresting you know this album for me it's just kind of a mixed bag it's not a terrible record you know Queens of the Stone Age have not completely fallen off but it almost feels like we're just kind of hearing you know leftovers from the band's last album but with some sort of mediocre production and I think honestly there is a discussion to be had about whether not this album is queens worst I mean lullabies to paralyze there's not really any contest here when it comes to which record has the better crop of songs the more consistent crop of songs and era vulgaris while that record does have some mediocre tracks on it does have some mediocre writing there are some flubs in the tracklist there it is a more dissonant experimental a wilder and more interesting record by comparison villains is much more predictable and I don't know that there's not really that x-factor there there are a handful of songs on this thing that I would certainly return to but this thing is nowhere near like on the level of the Bands best stuff I'm feeling a decent of strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best when should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you are angry okay Queens of the Stone Age villains here is a review of like clockwork next to my head over here check that out and yeah that's it I'll catch you guys in the next one you're the best forever 
GiStPHGw0lo,
cmYXxJs0uCk,hi everyone read the name Flamel oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new xxx 10th Ozzy own album 17 Floridian SoundCloud rapper underground heavy weight and double XL 2017 freshmen xxx 10th Ozzy owned one of the most polarizing controversial and popular artists in rap today who achieved viral sensation status off the back of songs like 70 in your hood or look at me hey this student became an ear overnight sensation and since it was these spare tracks on soundcloud and on youtube that made him he continued to drop them through 2015-2016 the first half of this year occasionally stopping to release a spare EP like kids and it wasn't enough and Willy Wonka was a child murderer needless to say exes aesthetic his lyrics they're pretty dark and edgy that was the impression that I and most people got from his double XL interview freestyle cypher performance especially the cypher performance and also from some of the material that dropped on his recent revenge compilation now while some people have pigeon-holed exes like this angry screaming meme rapper he's actually showed quite a bit of versatility with his recent singles over the past few months dropping tracks that have like more of an R&B flavor more of old school 90s boom bap flavor tracks that are like lonely sort of atmospheric guitar ballads I'm not even an ex fan and it aggravates me when I hear people say that all he does is yell now despite some recent reservations and disappointments I've had with some revelations about exes past some of his recent output his double XL performance and all that I was actually pretty curious as to what he would do on his first big full-length commercial outing which comes in the form of 17 this 21 minute 11 track venture into the mind of X as he pretty much describes the point or the message of the album with a very low-key spoken word piece right at the start of the record where he basically sounds like he's on the verge of crying at the idea of like somebody listening to this album and not liking it and not accepting it and not accepting him so given that I should probably come right out and say I did not like this no I know I did not I would not listen with a fox I would not listen in a box I would not listen in the rain I would not listen on a train this thing did not live up to the hype that was set out for it like not even a little I mean there are a handful of decent moments on this thing specifically on tracks like carrion and fuck love and joseline Flores all of which are very somber very forlorn rap songs that feature a lot of bars about heartbreak and death which is pretty much the lyrical angle I expected going into this record but is ex saying anything profound on this album not really I could really only see people being moved by ex's state of depression on this album if you yourself were depressed and going into this album just merely looking to hear somebody else who's depressed because there's nothing really all that smart or dynamic or detailed or refreshing as to how X expresses that depression the poetry he delivers in these songs runs at about the quality of the really terrible of poetry that you see scrawled all over notebook paper on the cover of this project it's like reading a mature LiveJournal poetry from an emo kid circa 2002 only time I feel pain when I feel loved that's why it's tatted on my face I'm that damn numb only time in my mind when I'm all alone that's why I'm never alone in the nighttime needless to say X is boring monotone flow does not really enhance the feeling or the the the beauty of this poetry and neither does the mostly lifeless flat production that is super basic and a lot of the time just kind of carried by a single moody sample of some sort and another weird thing is that a lot of these songs know pretty much all of these songs are about the length of an iTunes preview like just a little longer none of them are really all that well-developed they pretty much just hit listeners with an intro and a verse and then they just kind of repeat and Peter out into nothing maybe you get a hook I mean the song saved me kind of hits a really dark despondent intensity point in the second half of the track but X doesn't really develop that into anything he just kind of lets his vocals screaming save me and these really sad piano chords just kind of carry him out until the the sound and the emotion of the song just gets stale in the case of revenge or the song depression and obsession the music and X's vocals just kind of meander pitifully over guitar chords mostly with kind of mumbly badly mixed singing that tries to convey emotion with a lack of emotion like it's so flat and it's so lifeless it's supposed to be communicating to you that it's depressed but yes actually these songs are kind of like I don't know really dreadfully boring emo folk I mean I'm not sure that's all I can really think to call it which I guess isn't necessarily a bad thing I mean there's some good acoustic emo music out there but there's really nothing interesting about X vocalizing over a set of copied and pasted drums and guitar chords and believe it or not this is actually not as bad as listening X try to sing his way through a set of piano chords like on the dead inside interlude or on the song Orlando where it sounds like he's unintentionally writing the intro to an Evanescence song where he hits me with maybe my favorite line on the entire project so nobody wants death cuz nobody wants life to end such sad very emotion much dark many profound and the lines deeper into the song do not get any better I mean occasionally they border on funny like this one where he's talking about waiting on death with a smile on his face exactly the kind of line you right when inspired by the visual of your Heath Ledger why so serious Joker poster hanging on your bedroom wall I mean if Hopson wrote this shit and he would you guys would be clowning the shit out of it but because X is saying it it's like deep like this album is so edgy and it's so obsessed with trying to convince the audience that it's dark when it's really just shallow and annoying if X has convinced you that he's deep with the music he's presented on this album he could probably convince you of anything and to remind people who I know we're going to freak out over this review please remember I am NOT reviewing X as a person I'm reviewing this album my thoughts on this record have nothing to do with the events that inspired these songs or whether or not X is truly a troubled person I have no doubt that he is my question is whether or not he manifests these feelings and events into quality verses instrumentals songs and performances and in my opinion no he does not between this and the new little peep album I am legitimately worried that we are in for a wave of narcissistic sad rap over the next few years but I hope I'm wrong though so overall I mean this is not good this is a very bad album if you could even call it that it's it's like a loosely strung together and badly written unfinished set of songs that only round out at about 20 minutes the lyrics are subpar occasionally laughable the singing is mediocre the rapping is just average the instrumentals are bland the whole thing is steeped in just like this pitiful angst and to top it all off this album is essentially the musical equivalent of this shirt you laugh at me because I'm different I laugh at you because you're all the same I'm feeling a decent - on this

I4WgAk5GxV8,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd hope you're doing well you may notice that in this video you are not getting high quality microphone sound because the microphone has been rendered useless because I got a new computer got to get a sound card to plug this thing into but still we're gonna go over what I felt were the best and worst tracks of the week

description to that app alright let's go weekly track roundup time of course also before I get into all the tracks I have to push out that I think a shout out to the tour I'm going on this October please hit up some of these tour dates if you're there Seattle Washington Pro in Oregon San Francisco Los Angeles San Jose Brooklyn we have an Alston at Massachusetts Day and they hand in Connecticut date all of these why is this microphone near me all these tour dates have tickets available son some of the ages I talked with the Booker and had her slide the ages down like from 21 to 18 or from 18

because there were some tickets and dates that were not available prior also down there in the description head up our amazon associates link if you live in the US and you click on it and it's down

a fantastic website where you can buy a colorful pressings of records that I reviewed on my youtube channel or you can buy a turntable stuff audio equipment stuff for the budding record collector we also get kicked back when you use that link and let's get into what I need to talk about in this episode of course ooh Taylor Swift we're gonna front-end this one with the new Taylor Swift single look what you made me do people been talking about it people in saying I got to talk about it I know I got to talk about it there's not a whole lot information-wise about the single that has not already been leaked to the public or has not already been made widely and sort of readily available like the sort of Right Said Fred co-writer credit on this thing because Taylor basically kind of mirror images the hook - you know - sexy and you know kind of mocks it a little bit or you know creates a musical Mach other with the hook on this track singing look what you made me do and what you made men do because it sounds like I'm too sexy for my shirt I don't know how Taylor essentially took a really catchy hook from another song and somehow made it less kerchak I think the song is just okay personally I think it's just okay it's certainly a change of pace for Taylor and there are elements of this change of pace that I think are cool that I like I like the production and her singing everything is a little bit more low-key it's a little bit more minimal it's a little bit more sleek it's a little bit more sexy okay but it's also not that great of a song again the hook is very weak a lot of the vocals sort of tricks and gimmicks throughout the track are super silly like the whole part about Taylor not being able to come to the phone was like so cringe-worthy I threw up in my mouth a little bit and I don't know it's it's it's it's going for sexy but it's not that sexy you can't just pout your lips and sway your shoulders a little bit and just sexiness just falls out of you it doesn't happen like that so you know I have a sneaking suspicion that if Taylor goes in that direction with this entire album that's most likely what it's going to be but I'm hoping not you know I certainly tolerated it more than I do most of Taylor's singles so I don't know it's it's kind of a win kind of a win and I also want to give a shout out to the band pup because they came out with this amazing new music video that is a choose-your-own-adventure music video linked down there in the description please give it a shot let's get into the worst tracks of the week okay worst tracks of Louie pulling no punches on this set of tracks over here new William Patrick Corrigan track over here or you know him as Billy Corrigan a frontman of Smashing Pumpkins he is going to be coming out with a new solo record soon which he has released solo material in the past people are acting what he hasn't but he has and this is kind of the new the new lead track from this upcoming project and it's just kind of a bland disappointing orchestral e enhanced piano ballad that just drags on way too long this sound and this style is not really Billy Corrigan's wheelhouse so he sounds kind of awkward and out of place here and it's it's really just kind of a drab song and that's all you can really kind of say about it moving on from there this new song check one from King cruel while I have enjoyed and appreciated a lot of kink rules material in the past I do not really get the appeal on what he's going for on this new cut over here the spoken word passages and the instrumental word is really flat really lifeless really uninteresting didn't build anything in terms of tension in my opinion song just seemed like a really abstract mess for me to be completely honest and finally I want to give a shout out to the negative shadow obviously to the new doom song over here doomsayer which is set to be on an upcoming compilation of just kind of notebook tracks b-side material that Adult Swim is releasing track by track one track a week and given the material that I had heard thus far I kind of just had a sneaking suspicion suspicion that every single song was just going to be like some weekly recorded mediocre throwaway cut and that just kind of seems to be the case especially with this new track over here I mean doom is just sounding more tired than ever and I don't know if this is a super old track of super new track I really don't know the performance is just really not there lyrically he's not at his best and the instrumental while it is quirky it's also really tedious and I just don't really know what else to say I did not really care for this song at all let's get into the tracks that we thought were kind of mad I wanted to shout them out but they weren't my favorite but you know still worth talking about store with mentioning still worth linking down there in the description check these tracks out too if any of the sounds or artists here interest you I want to give a shout out to the new Tyler the Creator sort of cut over here it's him sort of freestyling over and instrumental from jay-z his new album some of his bars and his flows here are actually really good it kind of shows just how much Tyler has improved as far as his rapping in his lyrics coached by leaps and bounds since his last album it just seems like he's put in so much effort in his rap style since Cherry Bomb and it really shows not just on his new album but on this track over here you know if you really kind of want to hear Tyler you know doing really well you know doing some of his best rapping because I think he is as far as rapping goes at his peak lately don't miss out on this thing moving on from that the new propoganda track titled failed Imagineer I've never really been huge on the whole like melodic hardcore nineties skate punk sound propoganda is one of those bands that you know is probably one of the best when it comes to that style it's just kind of a personal preference however I thought this new tune wasn't too bad and you know there's no harm or you know nothing wrong with shouting out you know just kind of pointing out or getting people to listen to some propoganda it's just not really my favorite flavor of punk but you know still tons of risk for this band and you know they were coming out with some great music very consistently over the years and I have to admit I love this fucking album cover it's a genius imagery paired with the album title here moving on from there for tet has a new track out that's kind of okay you know it's kind of like some low-key techy housey stuff you know not quite as textured or as sonically denser as interesting as some of my favorite material of his but is a decent song and you know definitely check out his band camp because there's a lot of cool loose stuff on there all the time moving on from there the new Foo Fighters cut which I thought was just kind of a relief just dragged out overblown ballad not a whole lot of excitement for me on this song I don't know what it is the new Foo Fighter material is just not really hitting me you know and well I've never been like the biggest fan of their most recent stuff there have at least been like a song or a single ear in there that's like wowed me or you know been at least a little exciting the the new material for me it just seems like I don't know it's just not direct enough it's just not direct enough Chelsea wolf wanted to shout out the new Chelsea wolf track over here which is um title offering this song is sort of interesting for me it's it's not the most fiery or exciting single I've heard so far in teasing up to this new record and I anticipate that this song may grow on me a little bit in the context of her new album but while this is the most mild song I've heard from her so far this year there was something about it the kind of reminded me of Lana Del Rey but if like it was a good Lana Del Rey song like singing we're better and the instrumentation we're a little bit more interesting like kind of smart it kind of sparkles and like a very on almost vintage way and the ballad and the song is kind of very nice there were some moments where I feel like it dragged a little bit but um I don't know man there's just something about the song it reminds me of like a good Lana Del Rey and that's and that's no insult the Chelsea at all you know in the past there had been people who have have compared both of their you know albums to me and I've been like what are you talking get the hell out of here I've been like totally offended and then uh this is the first time I've heard a Chelsey song I actually like here the comparison I actually see in comparison and thankfully you know I I didn't feel like it was a bad comparison you know it's like wow this lake reminds me of this but but better but better the new BEC song is okay kind of feels like a sort of punchy clean very digital 60s psych pop throwback decent groove on it the vocals are okay you know it's not the best song he's ever written but it certainly has more of a pulse than a lot of what he presented on his last album so I give a check out to this new backtrack over your dear life and I want to give a shout out to this new collaborative track with ski mask the slump got an ASAP ferg I think they bring some pretty Inc excuse me pretty incredible chemistry on this track the beat is obviously like a throwback to you know get your freak on like if you're my age or around my age you probably remember that song like ruling the radio the track is okay I think again the chemistry between these two is really good not that I thought it was going to be bad I mean ski mask kills it on nearly every new track I hear him on and ASAP ferg can bring a lot of energy when he needs to he can be really eccentric when he needs to be it's just that you know the hook isn't really there the tune is just okay and I wish that the beat was a little bit more original it just kind of feels like almost a remix the the the instrumental is so kind of predictable because it's really just kind of based off of the sample that it NAB's for the most part and let's get into the best tracks of the wake all right shouting all these out again they're linked down there in the description along with everything else I've been talking about I've got to give a shout out to this new god damn zombie track skittles this is a really cruel texture and interestingly like grooved piece of techno I don't know what it is with this track and like the last track I heard from zombie like he's coming out with some pretty cool stuff lately like some really crazy and very punchy and very imaginative electronic music um you know I haven't been crazy about a lot of this stuff in the past some of it has been a little limp to me a little to atmospheric a little to washy but this is just so in your face and just hard as nails like the new wu-tang track over here featuring Redman really kind of nice to hear Redman back in the fold with wu-tang on a new song and I don't know man this thing's so the solid instrumental like bars galore good energy I mean it's obviously not throwing it back to the gruffness and the aggression of the 90 stuff but I don't know there's like a lot of good things about this track a lot of good things about it so throwing the best over here pleasantly surprised very pleased with the material on this one and the performances from everybody from Redman to Raekwon everybody moving on from their new wolves in the throne room single which was released via the whole Adult Swim you know singles collection this is their 15th single this week I think and definitely one of the more grim and ferocious and atmosphere tracks I've heard them promoting in this new album cycle just kind of enjoying what I'm hearing you know seems like really nasty maybe not his epic as like the material they put on their last record which was mostly like ambient or to hunters but you know certainly some powerful stuff you know definitely not as dry and his flat is like the last track I think they dropped with like a music video attached to it this one I thought was much better you know again black metal over here if you haven't you know sort of a listen to this band at all you know it's a very nasty wild mystical black metal with a lotta atmosphere around it moving on from their open mike eagle has a new track out which i don't want to talk about too much because i'm gonna be reviewing his new album soon most likely but new open mike eagle brick body complex you know it's introspective its melodic very interesting grooves on here open mike always brings an incredible amount of personality in his lyrics again not gonna get too deep into it but I do like the track a lot and am looking forward to talking about this new cut this new round record rather a new Mogwai song goddamn like the last single in my opinion I thought just okay and this new track for Mogwai who are an amazing instrumental band post rock band instrumental rock band they dropped this new track and it's like this driving somewhat punky rock track with like some some decent lead vocals the track is titled eternal Panther and I don't know man it's just it's got an engine on it you know it's got like got a nice amount of momentum to it this is not like the style of music that I would typically expect Mogwai to dabble in but they they really step outside of their comfort zone here and they do a really well you know that's thing about Mogwai you know they have a lot of Records in their discography that are just okay but each album is a surprise each album is a new direction it's a new page to be turned in the Bible of Mogwai you know they've had releases in their past that are more cynthy and electronic they've had releases in the past that are heavier and harder ones that are more low-key and Spacey or like they're all over the place they're all over the spectrum and this new track just kind of continues to improve the creativity in the in the adventure of Mogwai moving on from there I do like the new lone track quite a bit it's had a lookingglass it's some very creatively sound crafted techno that I think comes together really well definitely the freshest and most interesting as far as like sonic textures that I've heard his music you know sort of present in a while moving on from there I do like the new Killers track quite a bit wonderful wonderful it is an amazing heavy loud passionate ballad I don't know it's like a really strong hook like I'm really loving how hype and again how passionate this newer material from The Killers is and I don't know I'm just really kind of crossing my fingers for an amazing album here it's like been a while since I've legitimately been impressed with like the killer stuff so I don't know this this new set of tracks like they hit pretty hard new clearance clarity clearance clarity is back amazing songwriter singer producer check out his album no now if you haven't already one of my favorite records in art pop and experimental pop and one of my favorite albums of the year that had dropped this guy kind of fuses elements of like mainstream pop R&B with like weird sound collages and experimental shit like glitchy shit elements is like hip-hop here and there too and his production and I don't know man like this song is one of my favorite songs he's come out with in a while it's titled uh I don't want to get the title wrong here because I think it's really cool they say your God Slayer like really awesome vocal performance on this track and the song just kind of hits me in the same way that a lot of the best material on his last album did which I think he was trying to depart away from with some recent singles but now it just kind of feels like he's back in the pocket of bringing really creative glitchy strange production but even though it's wildly experimental and there's something really weird something really odd really left-field about it the song is so goddamn catchy like the vocal is so freakin the undeniably catchy that I just cannot get over it like it's sticks in my head so hard so shout out to Clarence for you know just continuing to be fucking awesome and the last track that I want to shout out to you guys over here is this new Alex Cameron song featuring angel Olson okay it's like a nice ballad nice duet and the music video is amazing like depicting this girl kind of being obsessed with him and wanting to dress like him and kind of like like flyering the town that she's in looking for him or something and the way that Alex and Angel come together on this track like it's it's just a really nice performance like they had quite a bit of chemistry other vocals their vocal styles just complement each other really well and yeah I mean between the solid tune the great vocal performance is on here the chemistry and the very cool music video like there's there's nothing bad that I could say about this cut and sort of this this offering right here just kind of looking forward to what Alex does more in the future because honestly this is the first I'm hearing of Alex's music so this is like a really good introduction for me and hopefully it is for you as well and that was the best and worst tracks of the week remember all those tracks are linked down there in the description we have our sponsors over a siegy look up their link down there in the description tour dates tour dates tour dates Amazon Associates link turntable lab associates link but again especially the tour dates tickets purchased ahead of time are less expensive than tickets if you were to buy them at the door and I have not seen the ticket sale numbers yet for the week or so that I've been promoting these things so I don't know how close any of these venues are to selling out but I've done dozens of events like this before just never in kind of a you know linked up tour quite like this and some of them have sold out and a lot of people come we have a good time we do Q&A we do music stuff we do mean stuff it gets kind of ridiculous you know there's a lot of like fan interaction and stuff and you know afterwards I do you know picture shaking hands because some babies so hopefully you guys get to come out and we'll all have a good time all right I'll see you guys the next video hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this video I got a lot of reviews to do this week just really kind of pumping them out because I'm trying to catch up with everything the for the tip Tasi on the brach can't and I don't need Ferg I mean ASAP mob you know Queens of the Stone Age Liars that there's a ton war on drugs it's too much but I'm gonna try to get it all done and just pump it all out alright guys you're the best forever forever forever [Music] 
ci62GfOm-t8,uh hi everyone freshly poured lien here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new little Aussie vert album love is rage - loo-loo sievert is a fully rap sensation he's been making noise for the past few years with a series of very viral very hot singles and mixtapes love his rage p's and q's the perfect love suzy vert vs. the world his popularity and distinct voice earned him a double XL freshman spot lots of rave reviews as well but sadly his style has never really clicked with me and it's not for lack of originality I mean amongst the current crop of rap crooners doing their thing / very glitzy melodic trap beats Suzy definitely has a weirdly nasal like yeah kind of strained Tambor to it I think there's a certain moodiness to his music as well that sort of sets him apart from a thugger or a future or whatever contemporary of his you want to compare him to however there's not a whole lot of depth to what Ozzy does I appreciate that his music is simultaneously like blissful sad spacey but his lyrics are about the equivalent of taking a package of Oreos blending them up into crumbles throwing them into a cereal bowl pouring a quart of milk on top of that and just it's not a very well-balanced meal now this album or project is really more like a retail mixtape it's the long awaited follow-up to the original love is rage that dropped back in 2015 however I wouldn't just simply call it a rehash I mean there are some notable improvements here the production is more detailed Guzzi vert his vocal recording is better all around just the sound of this thing is cleaner the fidelity is higher also I think Suzy comes off a bit more versatile on the vocal side but every time he steps out of his like strain the LP tone he kind of sounds like someone else there were cuts on here where he had these weird vocalizations that kind of reminded me of thugger or he would go really deep and he'd remind me of like one of the migos and the song 4 4 4 + 2 2 - sounds like an unreleased designer song like I was repeatedly checking the lyrics on this album to make sure that there weren't more features on this thing then were actually listed and in fact that was not the case Luzi is just kind of jumping around with these really weird inflections all over this project and either intentionally or unintentionally just like for mere seconds like channeling other rappers still as annoying as this is it kind of provides a decent amount of variety across the album it sort of allows him to I guess sort of keep the project or keep the sound of these songs from becoming redundant without him bringing a bunch of features into the fold still the fact remains there's not a whole lot of substance to what little Aussie vert does sure this thing and ooze ease sound are fine for like a handful of tracks especially the cuts that have a more coherent and visceral groove like early xx rager or 444 + 222 oddly enough the song EXO tour life is a single that kind of grew on me with time it easily has the best vocal melody and best hook that I think Izzy has ever weaved into a track push me to the edge oh my friends oh I could see why the emo bands are loving this song still the verses are loaded with these needless lyrics and vocalizations that a lot of the time despite the dark vibe of the track sound more hilarious than serious and that's the thing who wants to hear this dude hit your eardrums with like these auto-tune bleats for an hour and yeah please like a sheep or a goat I don't care that the production is mostly decent I don't care that the weekend essentially flies in to save us with some decent singing for a track I don't care that the Pharrell appearance is pretty cool and I don't care that occasionally little Aussie vert his his lack of decent lyricism sort of drives him into a direction where he somehow comes up with something kind of quirky and like really weird like neon guts this is just another mixtape masquerading or being sold as an album where an artist essentially just throws the same shit at a wall for an hour just to kind of see what sticks and while Izzy's lyrics aren't really that deep or significant that's not the worst thing about them they're not really funny or clever or memorable or sticky either they're just kind of bland generic vaguely emotional Sooey about texts and relationships and breaking up all of which is kind of embellished with a lot of very dime-a-dozen like trap style rap rags just like you would get sick to your stomach if you binge don like two pounds of Sour Patch Kids I felt almost like I was getting a stomachache but in my fucking brain like what I was listening to is so vapid and mindless and stupid that I was becoming dumber the more that I listened to it Leonardo DiCaprio think quick cook did she talk to you about Playa heard she talked to a ballplayer the songs on this thing vary between being tolerable and completely obnoxious and what few highlights there are and the track listing here are kind of outshined by the fact that there is so much mediocre material on this thing that shares so much in common with the best tracks but hey if you're looking for a continually trippy trap tape with Uzis vert playing a vocal shape-shifter with a series of very tedious melodies over some melodic trap instrumentation I I will not I will not stop you go for it I'm proud of you you're the best I'm feeling a light two decent three on this thing transition have you given this tape I'll listen have you loved it have you hated it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry come in the comments if you're angry over here next to my head is another little is everted you and you can click on that watch another video or you could click on the link to subscribe to the channel cool cool see you guys in the next one forever 
tjati_HVw5s,uh hi everyone mustache the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new grizzly bear album painted ruins grizzly bear New York indie heavyweights this is the group's fifth full-length album I believe they put out a set of very excellent albums in the mid in late 2000s starting with the very funky beautiful detailed and spellbinding yellow house and then from there they went on to a much poppier refined and direct sound on vacatio mast then in 2012 the band followed things up with the record shields which showed them stripping back their lavish production a little bit sticking more to drums guitars vocals the songs were a bit simpler not quite as colorful but the tunes were certainly admirable however at the time the record did strike me as being a little too uniform and kind of like they were stylistically repeating themselves a little bit now it's been five years about since the release of that album and things have been pretty silent on the grizzly bear front with studio material with solo material and then suddenly the band pops back up on our radar with a series of very slow burning singles and promotion of this new album over here pretty much all of which left me kind of cold or just scratching my head I was kind of hoping these tracks would grow on me in context of the album certainly the aesthetic the sound the vibe of the record is impressing me a bit more than shields did about a half a decade ago there's much more sonic depth to this album the guitars ring out very beautifully are drenched in atmosphere as much of the instrumentation in the mix is the boys vocal harmonies are deep they're resonant they're layered very nicely and twist together and there all sorts of very washy glossy synths in the mix - it's a very very like spread out panoramic sound and I'm happy to see this kind of sound play a return into grizzly bears repertoire because that's kind of initially what attracted me to the band in the first place but there are so many tracks here in the tracklist that are hitting me and just still feeling like they're cold as ice and for a while I just could not put my finger on exactly why because it certainly sounds like a grizzly bear album but as I got more and more with some of these tracks I just kind of left myself leaving them wondering where the hell are the songs on this thing because some of the material here just does not have a strong tune to it or a strong sense of structure and there's no amount of lavish instrumental color that can make up for that because without a strong defined structure to hold all of this color together you might as well take all of these Deep Purple's and neon pinks and baby blues and Trident greens and just violently swirl them all together until they become I don't know this hideous dirt color which pretty much explains the opening track to a tee I was equally underwhelmed by the lack of a compelling song on the song morning sound which lifelessly plods along with this really drab like indie rock groove that is so boring as if this groove is somehow a replacement for a solid song idea I mean it's a slight improvement on the opener because it has a pulse but why is it so goddamn loud it's not like the instrumentation is really distorted or blaring or anything it just feels like everything is so horribly compressed the drums the bass the vocal harmonies everything sounds really booming which unfortunately saps away the dynamics that I think makes most grizzly bear tracks work makes them captivating to listen to which is kind of weird I never thought I would ever hear a grizzly bear album with quite this much compression on it however I could still see that on this project the band was going for something a bit more cerebral and Spacey and experimental and psychedelic to it's like they wanted to deliver a series of songs that were a bit more I don't know loosely defined and repetitive something the listener could really kind of get lost in which when I think of the band going in that direction I kind of liked the idea and I think if there was an indie band that could pull that off it's certainly them especially since grizzly bear does typically drum up some really beautiful sounds on their albums it's usually so easy to get engrossed in just the sound of their records because it is really blissful and warm and enveloping the issue is the band doesn't always pull it off which makes the album have a sort of rough start or leads to cuts where it seems like they weren't completely sure as to what they wanted to do like the song systole which is a kind of Spacey acoustic cut that sounds very pretty but the band never really put a proper ending on it or the track cut out which is another weirdly structured song that features this interesting build-up to the midpoint where the band sort of crashes in with these heavy like very I don't know very shrill guitar chords that are as sharp is like a brick flying through a bedroom window those kind of beat your head in for a little bit and then the song just sort of fizzles out trails off into nothing but weirdly enough it's where the band was really falling short of their target that kind of Illustrated to me what exactly they were going for and made me appreciate the moments on the record where I felt like they were doing it well or where they were sort of dropping little hints on the album like on the song for cypresses where for whatever reason the mantra of its chaos but it works sort of pops out on that song multiple times almost like daniel rossen is like making a statement about the album itself and the album's own title seems like a reference to the writing process of it like the band was going into these tracks with these sort of tattered and loose bits of song ideas and they sort of just heavily painted them with instrumental color sometimes it doesn't really matter how intensely the band paints these ruins though a lot of the time it feels like these tracks are just kind of delivering a very slow build-up whose only purpose is to reach a crescendo or an intensity point at the very middle of the song only for it to just disappear and evaporate slowly before the ending comes still there are moments here where the band digs up gold in the midst of their excursions into more abstract territory the song three rings I love the momentum of this track the area instrumentation the kind of scattered drumming it's tense and beautiful at the three minute mark of the track the song kind of hits this point where the instrumentation starts ascending and Edie delivers this beautiful lead vocal melody don't you the song losing all sense probably has the most traditional structure on the entire record the most that the man sort of shows a pulse in the tracklisting here I think this song could have easily been slipped into the VUCA Damas tracklist if not for the fact that there are these passages the track where it's almost like the instrumentation melts away a little bit into this swirling palette of vocals and guitar arpeggios it's a very Spacey it's very dense and heavy and the song Aquarion while it is another one of these cuts that that sort of hits an intensity point in the middle it is like weirdly jammy it kind of has this heavy somewhat fuzzy bass the drums while they are scattered like they are and many other cuts here they seem like a little bit groove here a little bit more intense I feel like I'm listening to an instrumental off of a progressive rock album out of the 70s if it weren't for the keyboard sounding so washy I wouldn't think this was a contemporary piece of music like if those Keys had more like an electric piano or an electric organ tone to them like damn this would have been like so yes I think glass hillside is one of the better built tracks on the tracklisting here I love the funky intro and the way that it blossoms into a very full and beautiful instrumental palette as it continues its very psychedelic it's very lush and the song neighbors also hit me as being a track with some good sonic escapades but also a sturdy structure as well and the song sky took hold is a great finisher on the record really the most epic track on the entire album like really gives a grand presentation for the end of this thing at least the album finishes stronger than it started it's just a really good multifaceted song I wished more songs in the tracklisting here got this ambitious with the way that they were built out rather than just building up and trailing off like a pyramid overall I thought this was a decent grizzly-bear album in a way it's like a weird mirror image of their last record what shields lacked in sound this sort of lacks in song given there were some tracks that grew on me as I listened to the album more but still there are quite a few moments here that really underwhelmed me because the writing was not that impressive you know tracks that if you really stripped them back to their barest of bones to their raw acoustics and lead vocal melodies they wouldn't be that interesting I'm feeling a decent of strong six on this thing

jbODBiZb808,ah hi everyone jam the jam ten oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the brand-new everything-everything album fever dream a fever dream is the fourth full-length LP from UK art pop outfit everything everything which is one of my most anticipated albums of this year because the band's last record get to heaven what was so good easily one of the funkiest punchiest most cutting-edge and vibrant projects of 2015 the band brought the instrumental muscle of a group like battles but also an incredible knack for writing very sticky eccentric hooks they also brought these very wild nasally lead vocals fast futuristic dance grooves an awesome blend of rock pop electronic music dance music all harmoniously melting together into a digital rainbow so going into this new record I was excited for another round of that always excited for another round of that but the singles leading up to the release of this album had me a bit worried the drum and guitar work didn't come off quite as intricate the grooves not as captivating not as visceral seemed like the production the instrumentation was intentionally stripped back a bit all around their sound seemed a little less potent which um I don't know might be easier to listen to for a newcomer but how eclectic and almost overwhelming everything everything sound was was really just kind of a major selling point for me with their last two records to see a fade on a new album even incrementally is going to be disappointing to some degree and that's pretty much the case on this new record unfortunately I'm not really sure what drove the band to tone down the risk factor and the busyness of their music on this new record over here especially since frontman Jonathan Higgs still sings with this really idiosyncratic yell pee delivery which is not going to be for everyone I mean the song run the numbers kind of lyrically implies that the band isn't really in this for popularity or the money or success maybe the band grew tired of how busy their music sounded I'm not really sure either way I still feel like the mathematical grooves and dense layers of instrumentation in there it kind of took a much-needed edge off the vocals to kind of prevent them from sounding a little overbearing or even obnoxious just hearing the band continue without these elements in their music that to me I sort of felt where essential is kind of like watching someone try to unmake soup like once it's made and all the ingredients are there and it's all just been boiled down into a complete meal you can't just start pulling ingredients out of it I can see generally across the album that the band is making somewhat of an effort at making a slightly moodier album here there are more low-key cuts in the track listing here than there were on the band's previous efforts and given the album title and the album cover may be a darker direction is what I really should have expected going into this especially since these are dark times that were in the midst of but is everything everything really a dark band I mean it's not like they're lyrics previously didn't address serious or violent or dark issues I just always thought it was interesting that the band crashed that into what was essentially a sonic firework show some of the more forlorn moments in the tracklisting here have Hague's almost sounding like I don't know a slightly more animated Thom Yorke like at the start of the title track or on the song put me together whose instrumental almost sounds like a leftover from the King of Limbs with its moody guitars and sanitized synths and cycling electronic beats and in a way there are other kind of parallels I could draw between this album and the King of Limbs I mean there are quite a few cuts here where it seems like everything everything is allowing more synthetics more sequence beats to sort of overtake the instrumental palette of the album and a lot of these throbbing electronics just feel kind of lifeless in comparison with the Bands previous work this doesn't happen on every track but enough to sort of keep that work in the back of my head I mean there are exceptions like the song white whale the guitar based and very pretty fluttery crescendo on that track is clearly not the King of Limbs it is much more okay computer but there are spots on this album that do not remind me of Radiohead okay still the low-key cuts that kind of underwhelming continue like on good shot good soldier a song that I feel like I enjoy more lyrically than I do musically I like the band's attempts at poking at some violent societal norms on this track however their social critique does occasionally go awry like the lyrics at the start of the song white whale they kind of make my eyes roll also the song big game which seems to be like I don't know just some really desperate childish mockery of a big powerful figure who that figure probably is is most likely obvious to anybody who reads into the lyrics it songs like this that put the burden of carrying the album on the louder cuts in the tracklisting here however some of those are just underwhelming ly direct like the song desire who's skipping bass and snare pattern just don't really inspire much for me despite the fact that the vocal harmonies on the chorus are very bright are very powerful and don't get me wrong I think the band's songwriting for the most part is very good on this project just as solid as it has been in the past just like on the track around the numbers the song night of the Long Knives is the visceral opener that I hope for on this album but there's a noted tone of eeriness to it that I think is really fitting and the song ivory tower is a bustling complex track that can go toe-to-toe with anything everything everything has recorded up until this point and even the can't do single has grown on me within the context of the album even if the chorus is a little incessant at points but this album is just not a very instrumentally adventurous project for everything everything I do like the strange disassembled instrumental palette on the song put me together at the midpoint of that track however moments like this are just for you and far between on this record not enough surprises not enough dynamics especially as the band tries to go long on the title track with this additional three minutes at the tail end of the song where they try to revise this dance beat in a few different ways that just slowly grows stale as the track plods along unnecessarily overall though I think there are more wins than losses on this project it's just slightly less of everything that made the band compelling to me in the first place a little less surprise a little less challenge a little less fun the lyrics don't hit me as being thoughtful as before there's still a handful of great tracks on this thing it's certainly better overall than the band's debut I just think they regressed a little bit and kind of treaded some water a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate

Iju3kpyFTFU,I got scratched hi everyone scratched and scratched and oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd it's hot it's sweaty out it's muggy it's humid stop I just I just won't fall to be here and it's time for a review of the new ace Hatford project still striving ASAP ferg is a New York rapper a part of the ASAP mob he dropped a flawed but very underappreciated album in 2013 trap Lorde the album's sound took cloud rap down a very dark and moody path it had this pristine Sheen and atmosphere surrounding it that was just like really beautiful it was chilling and it matched very well with the grit and the aggression of the instrumentals and Ferg voice and lyrics and again Ferg's voices delivery very deep almost kind of goofy in a way but not so goofy it took away from his lyrics just enough to make him sound pretty unique and eccentric and kind of off-the-wall unhinged especially as he would pull out like this really weird singing voice girl remember sing my song like there were a lot of really cool unique quirks about this project that had me excited for what Ferg was gonna be doing in the future then down the road he would drop his always strive and prosper album which in my opinion was an utterly awful project one of the worst attempts this decade of a rapper trying to sound as commercial as possible and with an album so bad how could a SAP 4 bounce back in one breath it seems almost like a feat but in another I mean he's really kind of made it easy for himself I think he'd really have to be trying to make a terrible album on purpose to make a worse record so a while back he announced this new mixtape over here he dropped a lot of singles in preparation for it most of which I just thought were okay I was hoping that they would all come together and just be greater than the sum of their parts as a whole project here now of course I'm not reviewing this project by myself I've brought on fellow YouTube music critic and reviewer Sean say who has some very solid reviews and reactions on his channel which is linked in the description box check it out and we are essentially going to talk it out on this album hash it out on this album here we go ashen and here we are through the magic of the internet with mr. Sean C and we're gonna be talking about this new ASAP ferg mixtape Sean what did you generally think of this project was it better than the last album was a good overall what did you think so kind of coming into this one I was expecting more of the whole trap lore thing for kind of rules over that domain and giving you know music that's really trap based and that has beats that are kind of you know represent this urgency or this form of greediness in my opinion so that's kind of what I know him for what I want him for on the last album I think it was the always strive and prosper maybe I think that was that's what it was called yeah I didn't feel like that was representing him as well as he kind of wanted it to I feel like it was trying to be too you know mainstream to appeal to too many did maccer - too many demographics but with this one I thought it was good I didn't think it was you know crazy it was elements from trap Lord and from his most recent album or project in this one some things that I like something that I you know some that I didn't really care for some that I did but for the most part I think it was a decent project I wouldn't say that there's I don't see more people getting more than like five maybe six tracks out of this that they're gonna enjoy and keep coming back to in comparison with always strive it's definitely grittier it's definitely a bit of a return to form you know it's it's nowhere near as disappointing as as his last album was room seems like he's playing to his strengths a little bit more the production is more atmospheric again the lyrics and the beats are you know harder and more aggressive again doesn't seem like he's trying to sell you on you know too many sweet very commercial very radio-friendly hooks or anything like that but I think the project ends up getting weighed down in just the fact that there are so many freakin features on this thing yes like so many of which I don't think really kind of play too Ferg strengths like as much as I do like a little yachty feature here and there I'm not really sure if Ferg and yadi are the best combination I'm not really sure if Ferg and nav are the best combination the playboy cardies feature while I do like some of his features and I like a song here and there and I understand sort of the connect from the ASAP mob there his verse there was so throw away on madman yeah it was a computable moment and the song just kind of fizzled out directly afterwards as soon as like he sort of dropped out of his verse yeah which which is really unfortunate because there were actually some great features on this thing I mean the matress remix is fucking insane yeah that's right I love that one that song is so insane it's so awful think about that track though that's really funny is there's a bit of a Chanel vs. great value or Walmart thing going on because Ferg and rocky are like this should know they're going back and forth they're giving each other really great you know setups and then we get to Dex and rich the kid I think hmm and then it's just like you oh you're you're kind of the great valu version of what I just listened to but the whole song and you know and it still works I still like it a lot and I didn't think I would know the other posse cut the East Coast remix was really good too you know Snoop Dogg brought it up really well in the back I thought it was it was good I got did you move past that one for now because I got like a really bad rant for that one well I really like those cuts you know I was really happy to see Cameron on here you know because he's sort of like a New York throwback that I feel like a lot of Millennials don't really know about or appreciate these days the whole Dipset thing and he sounded really good on rubberband man which had a hook and a beat that was insane like I went absolutely nuts when I heard that beef like that was honestly between that track and trap and a dream I thought that like this is it he's like actually going to really deliver here I know there are some songs coming up later that suck but ok I'm gonna convince myself before this thing is even over that this is gonna be one of his better project yeah that's what I would like to do yeah and there's you know there's this middle part you know that you kind of have to get over until you really get to something great again and really do it like I said it's it's cool I think for like I said he's really I agree with use playing to his strengths more on this project definitely more than he was on the previous but he just comes across as like really formula and even with the way he uses his features it's like you know that little yachty you know that playboy car you know that made in Tokyo are not you know rappers who are known for lyrics or rappers who that who need their own verse on a song so for me it's like you're not giving them tools to kind of be desirable on these tracks you're just kind of making them be formulaic along with you when you could easily have real I'm just throwing them on there for the future just doing them on there for the attention and pretty much does and even the ones that are strong on here like the Dave East one and like I said I'd like the Cam'ron verse but it's not that much that sticks with me I think Cam'ron is a little bit more debatable because more people you know are gonna be invested in that I don't know as much about Cameron so I might not have a strong of a connection to him as others may but like the Davies one it's cool but then I'm like am I gonna listen to this again not really you know there are other tracks on there that kind of fall into that same formula and then the nav one is just like I was driving when I heard that track and I came to a red light and then naps part you know comes on and I just got like really depressed like out of nowhere like he started rapping and I'm like okay this is okay this is this isn't that bad you know because it's more of an upbeat it's kind of different from the rest of the album the vibe is a little bit more chipper I guess you could say it's a bit smoother and trying to be yeah somewhat sexier but yeah yeah and then I'm listening to and then nav comes in and I'm just like I stopped the car at the red light immediately and I literally asked myself that sounds like what am I doing with my life because he he gave me like the most like the most basic boring vocal pattern everything that's whistle blasts are similar yeah on this one it's just like this track is just like it's made for you to give some sexy energy if you want to call it that and it's just like where is it at it and I'm just not like usually an angle Ferg plays - well unless he's kind of being like sort of silly or ridiculous with it even now though I just would have you know something it just it just didn't give me anything that I thought of me he sounded like a baby robot on that track hello you know you're right she sounds like that almost tracks but on this one I just mean knowing that nav has that like super repetitive thing going on it had me stopping in my tracks like what am i doin my life like I kind of need to question some things so I don't end up like this guy so it made me like you know after I got done diagnosing myself with clinical depression I moved on with the track and it was like okay you know he gives me more that the struggle bars like the overuse I'm over the grass and the snakes are laughs it's just I just can't get with it not on that track no I agree and you know like you were saying about the Davey East track I mean me personally I'm not huge on Dave East as far as like listening to his solo stuff and he didn't really grab me on these two features that he had on here either to sort of go past the nav track you know his feature was obviously lackluster but in my opinion that was the worst track on the project and not just because of him I mean I think Ferg brought some of his most tasteless and most ridiculous lyrics on the entire project on that one song like you said famous decks it seemed like he was just kind of here to fill in a blank fill in a spot just kind of grab attention for people to just be like okay Dex is on this I'm a Dex fan so I'm going to check it out and again all the features kind of weighing this down it's such a shame because in my opinion the song that had no features in the middle of the whole thing Plain Jane was one of my favorites like he dropped that line in the track or he said he would fuck someone's bitch ironically and I don't know I was laughing I was just laughing my ass off at that line and I thought the hook was super smooth and catchy too home dude was like okay yeah okay so that was the that was the three 6 mafia reference track I was like because that's the one that had me I was like am i enjoying this more because of the reference or am i enjoying it because Burke is really giving me a lot and I think he did good with that truck as well I'm not gonna have like I said him like making music by himself I think I'm surprised it like I said he was able to carry a good amount of these tracks you know by himself like yeah even the tango song on here was I liked his you know relationship that he kind of depicts his relationship with the yams mom and yeah says by laying in his bed he somehow can get you know visions you know from what yams would normally do so that there's no moment on the record I thought that the production sort of fit the tone of the track to really well you know and like you said you know he does carry a lot of the record even though there are a lot of features on this thing because there aren't a lot of moments on here that I could think of where he's really super outshined you know obviously on the East Coast remix obviously a little bit on the mattress remix because there's so many people there but he does so well on the hook that it's like he kind of brings you back and kind of demands attention throughout the entire track but yeah you know I I just wish that he had given us another verse on a lot of these tracks rather than just trying to pad this album out with a bunch of hyped features in order to get people to listen to it and I don't know just in the end come out with a more solid project because at the end of the day a lot of these songs really are not as good as they could be just because I don't feel like everybody's giving their all or everybody appearing on this album really kind of fits or compliments in style and like you said earlier you know that there there is an element of him being kind of formulaic here not only in the sense that the way he plugs guests into songs over and over and over it's pretty much the same you know it's the same setup it's the same structure it's the same formula but also on top of that as much as I do appreciate that he's playing to his strengths once again on this project I feel like instead of kind of progressing past what he did on trapped Lord he's kind of just gone back to what's familiar and what's easy for him because of how always strive and prosper kind of blew up in his face a little bit so now he's just kind of like stepping back and just kind of getting back on what kind of works what's obvious what he knows his fans like him for but at the speed that rap is moving right now it's almost like the sound that he's delivering here at some points is like a couple years behind the curve you know yeah like I could definitely see that and I think like I said there's just not enough nutritional value to this album or to this project to get people to you know keep coming back to it like most of the time there's an more project you're like okay well I'd go to this thing for this reason but there aren't more reasons to listen to it then there are not good reasons to listen to it in my opinion that's like when I'm listening to this it's like a really easily consuming project you can take a few parts out of it and you shit the rest of it out pretty much and that was pretty much my biggest problem with the East Coast remix now for this one is like okay beats great come in Ferg is given great delivery great energy busta rhymes perfect opener after him we get further again switching up cadence and flows and giving lyrics and dropping bombs on my alright this is great then we get a sub rocky pretty cut you know it's not the greatest rocky verse but it's good it's doable I don't really like the part where he complains about people complaining about him having clear skin and there's another part I like the bar in there before that though that was a weird line to me that was red light to me that almost read like he was talking about other women being jealous of his clear skin the way I phrased it in my opinion the way that I read it when I heard it so yeah like that it was a little strange it like kind of threw me for a loop first like I got back into it cuz his flow was really nice yeah he rolls in the day beast really well and so at this point in the song I'm like alright this is great you know if I had to be in heaven right now this would be trap heaven and obviously for being you know the trap lore which I've got travel or whatever you want to call them you know and I'm alright this is great instead of me running through a field of you know dandelions and freshly cut grass and everything like that I wanted run through a field of money and instead of trees in nature in the background there's girls twerking on poles that endlessly go into the sky freshly on my freshly poured lean fountains everywhere right in the most natural part of this thing right is this the Sun the Sun is in the sky is shining bright uh-huh but wait here comes the solar eclipse but no it's not a solar eclipse it's fucking French from Montana coming to ruin the track again and then when he does get on the track woody what does he decide to do he decides to chastise other rappers for using familiar flows he has none himself he has no like versatility no no no nothing about him is like entertaining on this and then from that point on the track it just goes downhill for me because the hot my high is ruined you know he ruined it and then Rick Ross is really slow with his delivery it's just kind of slow as the rest of it down and then Snoop Dogg I don't know if you seen the meat in the music video for this Snoop Dogg's part in the music video is hilarious because he's given like a snapshot of filter angle I thought that was hilarious I thought that was a brilliant part of the video but I loved the song but everybody after Dave used to getting cut out for me I'll agree you know the weak links and the chain there are easily French Montana and Rick Ross I mean I thought French sort of sounded aggressive but I don't pay too much attention to his lyrics when I hear a French Montana feature to be fairly to be completely honest however you know to sort of have him and have Busta on a remix to me again kind of reads like Ferg going back and just repeating himself once again because Busta was on a remix from his last album trap Lord or his you know his debut album yeah I thought it was decent but nowhere near is kind of surprising and exciting unfortunately his trap wordless trap Lord was even though I wanted it to be that for the most part I'm feeling like a decent two strong six on this thing probably not much more to be fair all right well same same kind of feeling like I said it's it's decent nothing that much to it I had more you know issues with this so probably threw about a four on it okay all right thank you very much Sean for coming on and talking with me about this tape you guys can find a link to his YouTube channel down there in the description not only does he have some solid reviews and reactions but God his his his thumbnail game makes me a makes me pretty jealous and pretty jealous of the students thumbnail game okay we're gonna leave it there Anthony Fantana Sean C ASAP ferg still striving forever 
I_UJ-3yakDg,hey everyone Brandon he news hello here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of brand news return record science fiction this is the latest full-length LP from New York rock band brand new long considered to be one of the best bands in the emo scene although the band stylistically is much more than that it's kind of disingenuous to just simply label them as an emo band in fact when they were just an emo and a pop punk band that's truly when brand new was at their worst their best albums also incorporate elements of post hardcore acoustic and alternative rock indie rock packing all of these styles into these very passionate well crafted albums from start to finish and honestly I even like the experimental and abrasive turn the band took on their last album in 2009 dayz which in my opinion is a little underrated the band has essentially dropped three very good albums in the 2000s and have been in the midst of a studio album silence ever since until last year when fans were hit with news of the band getting back together and writing new music and that caused excitement understandably because I could really only imagine brand new coming back together unless they were going to add something that was essential to their discography and science fiction certainly does feel like a worthy addition to the band's musical canon it's a chilly despondent very ghostly album dynamic like a devil in god but the lows the subtle lows of this record dig even further into like a very dark emotional abyss mostly thanks to tracks like 137 and desert let me up the very moody intro to the song same logic even with the heavy guitars and the kind of Queens of the Stone Age style vocal harmonies that are very tight very sweet very catchy on the song out of mana which have kind of a devilish quality to them that I think is kind of specific to this album and brand news catalog it's also worth noting this is the band's longest album to date at 61 minutes but still in the midst of all of this long-winded gloom the band still finds ways to work in some pretty anthemic tracks like the song same logic / teeth that I mentioned earlier which reaches an incredible instrumental climax one of the few spots on the album are you actually get any scream vocal that kind of callback to the band's past couple of albums and their emo and post-hardcore influences also the song can't get it out which sounds like this mid-paced powerful mid-90s alt rock power ballad the lead vocal melody as the guitar sort of ascend with these heavy pounding chords is so amazing and substance oh passionate easily the most emotionally stirring spot on the album however the bulk of the record is really taken by these somewhat quieter and more subtle cuts they're very dark they're very sparkly which is perfectly fine that is if the band's writing and performances are enough to convince you on these songs I however and not completely sold on a lot of these tracks I mean for sure most of them if not all of them are well mixed and assembled and structured but what a lot of these tracks boiled down to are just some very middle turn ative and acoustic rock that seemed almost like they could have been written twenty years or so ago and most of them don't really deliver much of anything that feels all that memorable or exciting to me outside of an almost mandatory climax that some of these songs have to reach in order to justify the first three or four minutes of frozen bleak rock music tracks like waste and 137 come to mind and lead vocalist Jesse Lacey his singing on this album seems a little less distinct in my opinion less gripping than usual I mean he's never been one of the most unique singers as far as rock music and the 2000s goes but at least the emotion of his performances on day shalwar were captivating here instead on this new record most likely to fit with the very low-key vibe of the album he's playing a super flat and I'm not exactly sure if that was the best way to sell these songs like could never be heaven or the intro and outro track so the record which just slowly fall into the background for me the lack of energy coming through on Jesse's singing seems even more apparent on louder cuts like no control where the band just kind of sounds like some unenthusiastic post-grunge group doing their best Nirvana impression which is one of many moments on the album strangely enough that sounds like some kind of cleaner moody or more steam take on some of the alternative rock of the 90s which has certainly been an influence on the band's music before but on this one it seems like a really weird combination this record is simultaneously very cold and very modern but also at some points feels like an exercise in 90s nostalgia occasionally some of these quieter cuts do get graced with a more passionate vocal the song desert for example some of the harmonized background vocals on that track really do make the song what it is but even though some of the vocals on this thing are kind of lackluster the band does bring quite a bit of instrumental variety to this record so it's not like they're really kind of lacking on that front like the droning kind of distorted guitars and the area almost Mellotron ish keyboards on the song waste or the somewhat bluesy guitar licks all over the song 451 you know in its entirety this album is very listenable and after multiple lessons I would even say that a lot of parts of it are memorable even the refrain on the least attention demanding track on the entire album the closer is somewhat sticky ultimately the issue for me with this album is that I'm not really feeling much of it it's well put together everything sounds very balanced and there's not a single track on here where I could say the band literally is doing nothing and is merely just phoning it in but maybe this album is a band maturing to the point where if kind of lost that original spark or bite that made them appealing to their fans in the first place at least to a degree because a lot of the time I think my reservations on this album sit with the tracks or the band is really taking a risk going in this very dreadful fearful very melancholy direction which certainly seems to be the case when you look at some of the lyrical and implied themes of this album sadness loneliness paranoia mental illness I almost get the sense that the album's takeaway is that there's nothing scarier than one's own mind and maybe I'm reading too much of album I don't really know I mean it's a concept that seems like it's coming through to me it's a concept I agree with but for whatever reason it's just not really hitting me because a lot of these softer cuts to me don't feel super despondent they just feel really safe the songs are implying the depths of emotional hell but I don't feel like I'm being taken there and that's pretty much what's holding me back from going absolutely crazy about this record even though if there are a lot of technical and fundamental elements to it that I think are really good very quality but the emotional presentation and performance just really aren't 100% there I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the

4DyJIw58zFo,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a quickie review of the new Kodak black mixtape over here project baby - obviously the follow-up to project baby 1 and the second project Kodak has released this year Kodak Florida rapper if you didn't already know I've covered his stuff a couple times up until this point and honestly not seeing a whole lot of growth difference evolution or cause to be excited about this new tape over here I mean there might be a song or two that sort of pull out of the fray pull out of the muck of this mixtape and actually you know sort of become a viral hit or something most likely with the help of a music video backing a couple of them up but outside of that it just kind of seems like more of the same from Kodak black which maybe for hardcore fans is not necessarily a bad thing in a way I do think Kodak is coming into his own a little bit on this project and really hunkering down and focusing and hitting directly upon what exactly has made his songs in the past so popular with the smooth low-key kind of Moody very glossy trap instrumentals and Kodak over that of course hitting all these melodic licks with his small warble e kind of limited and very forlorn voice that formula is what has made some of his biggest songs so hot and so popular and now he just kind of seems like he's again really kind of laser focusing on that sound and on that style even more so than he did on his recent album however though I still feel like his rap style is incredibly tedious his flows are kind of really boring they're redundant not a lot of diversity not a lot of versatility not a lot of change ups in between songs and in between verses or anything like that it's very very dumbed down it's very very lowest common denominator the lyrics are so so every once in a while Kodak will come out with a bar like there was one moment on this project where he hit me with this line about him taking his dog to the vet but his dog turned out to be a rat dog obviously and rat obviously you know not not at being actual dogs and rats it's you know it's symbolism it's a metaphor you get what he's getting at there however that's not the only time he said that line on this project Kodak is one of the few rappers who like in such an unselfish way will repeat like particular lines on multiple songs almost as if he doesn't remember the last time he said it or as if like he just copies chunks from verses and other songs or copies just lyrics from songs and other songs just kind of pad them out or fill them out or you just kind of like writes a ton of songs maybe off the dome sort of in a long uninterrupted succession and then just kind of like lumps them all together into an album not really thinking about how they all sound together how ridiculous and silly it is to kind of hear like you know a line repeated two three four times across the entirety of an entire project but I mean outside of the couple of lines that are decent there's not a whole lot to say about Kodak's lyrics it really kind of comes down to vibe and sound and just the mood that he delivers on a song which you know occasionally can be good for a track or two but for an entire mixtape it really kind of gets stale it really kind of gets old because again he is a bit of a one-trick pony he doesn't have a whole lot of tools in the tool belt to maintain an audience's attention for the length at which this tape lasts I already said that the trap instrumentals are very glossy very smooth and there were a few songs on here where it seems like he is writing some legit love songs you know that were from the heart that was kind of a nice change of pace you know given Kodak blacks track record I don't know if you would want to take those love songs all too seriously but um I don't know I guess Kodak again he's sounding a little more focused and confident in his found it seems like he's going into the studio now knowing what the formula is going to be when he goes to record a project when he goes to put together a song however I feel like that has kind of hurt project maybe to a little bit in a sense because that has sort of limited Kodak blacks style that has limited his sound that has limited the experience of this project and has made the entire thing so uniform and so stuck almost in like an artistic rut of some sort that he's only kind of allowing himself to toy with this one style and this one vibe that he knows works for him and that's kind of it yeah I mean it does have a couple of highlights but it gets really old really fast and you know that's that's simply because Kodak blacks sound his style there's not a whole lot to it much like his past couple of projects I'm feeling like a four to a five on this thing and I'll just kind of leave it at that but you know let me know what you thought of this mixtape down on the comments did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next over here next to my head is a review of one of Kodak's previous projects you can click on that watch that or click on the link to subscribe to the channel okay

hg6WtElBwW4,oh hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I thought were the best and worst tracks of the week all listed right here linked down there in the description box so you guys can listen to all of them for yourselves and yeah doesn't doesn't get much more straightforward than that of course I have to mention a few things first let's get out of the way the fact that this October I'm going on tour some West Coast dates some East Coast dates we do talks we do jokes we do silly stuff we do meme stuff we do Q&A there's merch there's a meet-and-greet you know sort of at the end after the Q&A and everything so I've done you know well over a dozen of these things so far in the US and Australia they always compact they always come fun we always have a good time when we do one haven't really met anybody who didn't have a good time at one of these things so far and it's also kind of really exciting to have all of you guys in the same place at the same time because it's it's rare that you have such a large group of people so passionate about music in one space so again check these dates over on this poster down here there's a link down there in the description if you get tickets now it's cheaper than you would pay if you waited to sort of buy them at the door and a lot of these venues it's not super big super duper big maximum capacities so I don't know okay over the next few months these might sell I don't know I'm just putting them out there and I don't know what any of the ticket sales are so far we're gonna see but uh yeah hit him up get some tickets mark it on your calendar bring a friend and we're gonna have a good time all right also our amazon associates link is down there if you live in the u.s. click on it anything you were gonna buy anyway on Amazon just buy it we're gonna get kicked back from it supports the segment supports the show

with the good people over at turntable lab where once you click on the link down there in the description and you purchase a record some colorful pressing of a record that I've covered on the channel or maybe some audio equipment like turntable or some speakers or something we get kickback from that and that's gonna be that let's get into the worst tracks of the week again all those links are down there hit them up tickets tickets tickets alright first off let's kick it off with Weezer unfortunately a new track out titled Mexican fender originally I kind of had this in the Mac category but the more that I thought about it the more I really kind of disliked this track I don't know it's just kind of generic Weezer super sugary super hyper bland in my opinion in the grander scheme of their catalog feels almost like they're kind of going back to make-believe a little bit rivers kind of has this tendency to write songs that are sort of assembled from these lyrics that are just random ideas that don't actually come together and say anything and sometimes it's okay sometimes it's not sometimes it works out sometimes it doesn't this is one of those instance where this is one of those instances where I really don't think it does I think it actually kind of works against the song to be as nonsensical as it is it really kind of communicates nothing and as far as the guitars and the chord progression the there's there's really not much going on here that's all that interesting and it seems like the little bit of an edge that either that Weezer gained with their last album has sort of dissolved a little bit with this new track over here as well as that that last track that kind of the the the EDM sort of instrumental behind it I am NOT looking forward to this new Weezer LP none of the singles have been all that good in my opinion and I don't know man it's gonna be really disappointing to sort of bounce back from the White Album into a bad Weezer record but that's what I'm sort of anticipating at this point neck-deep this new neck-deep song titled in bloom not really all that impressed with it and not getting exactly why everybody's recommending that I listen to the band's new new record it just kind of sounds like bland run-of-the-mill emo tinged pop punk to me there's nothing really all that interesting about the lyrics nothing really all that interesting about the production or the instrumentation and just seems really kind of dime a dozen to the point where it's semi nauseating moving on from there new Chris Brown song questions I do I need to explain it it's it's not very good the best part of the song is the refrain that he rips off from another better song halfway into the track come on let's not kid ourselves new ASAP mob track over here titled feel so good this song is pretty much exactly the reason why ASAP mob when they come together they're like less than the sum of their parts because I don't know I I don't think ASAP Ferg and ASAP Rocky as much as I like them I don't think they complement each other that much a lot of the time especially on this track and the the the sort of talent gap between Ferg and rocky and the rest of the crew is just so large I mean the moment that I hear almost any other member of ASAP mob rapping I want to go to sleep there is ice melting grass growing paint drying and ASAP 12-year apik alright let's move on let's move on to the the met tracks tracks that I wasn't crazy about but certainly were worth mentioning the new rich Chickasaw glow like that rich chigga comes through with song over here where he's he's legit trying to pin a love song here some of the lyrics I think are a little lackluster like not quite as endearing or as heartfelt as I probably would have liked out of a song going in this direction from chicka but it does have a nice vibe to it the instrumentals cool his deep flaws his deep voice and smooth flow do the song a lot of flight of flavors favors as they usually do on every single track he does and yeah just kind of genuine generally enjoying it not crazy about it but it is a nice tune show some versatility new LCD Soundsystem single tonight I will say this song was measurably better than the last two LCD Soundsystem tracks that I thought were really mediocre and to me have felt even more mediocre the longer I sort of get away from the release of those tracks this new one over here starts much better has a very punchy funky electro synth bassline that is very nice James Murphy's vocals seem really impassioned and it seems like he's going to you know really kind of live up to the standard that the band has set in the past the drum beat is very nice as well but like with those previously released tracks the groove and the instrumental gets stale as the song plods along though there is kind of a nice finish and James Murphy yet again just really doesn't have much to say like his lyrics aren't funny they're not clever they're not very observant they're not poignant they're not witty they just kind of feel like filler you know and and there are some songs like for example pow power seems like Murphy is really all over the place and not really trying to say anything all that coherent but even in moments like that there was so kind of this sense of wackiness or fun or randomness or I don't know just uh irony - enjoyable irony - to what he was doing there and on this track it just doesn't seem to be the case I'm just not sort of getting exactly what the band is getting at it seems like they're trying to force something at this point in my opinion moving on from there a new track from KMD of all things the defunct hip hop group that once featured MF doom under another name of course obviously has a new track out titled true lightyears featuring Jay Electronica I'm not exactly sure what makes this a KMD track is it the production I don't really know it's nice to hear that doom and Jay have some very cool lyrical chemistry as they kind of trade off you know back and forth a little bit on this new track over here but the structure isn't really there the instrumentals kind of underwhelming to hear Jay and on the same track is pretty much the only thing that makes this track exciting and again like to kind of call this a KMD song it seems a little disingenuous to be completely fair new gucci mane song over here featuring me goes of course me goes really kind of take on the whole front end of the song and gucci kind of cleans up at the back it's a decent track you know they've collaborated a few times before and in my opinion this is not the most electrifying collaboration they've done but you know it is kind of a I guess a nice product you know they definitely complement each other's style moving on from there aerial pink feels like heaven not the best single I think Ariel has released in this new album cycle of his it kind of has a very washy low-key almost new romantic synth pop sort of vibe to it that it's kind of Pleasant you know it's it's not usually the style or sound I enjoy hearing Ariel indulge in and I don't really think it's sort of placed to a lot of his strengths and I think he tones down some of the accentuate the eccentricities in his vocals a little bit because he doesn't quite sound like himself but um he certainly does the sound and style justice i I just don't know if it's doing him justice I guess and finally I will shout out the new alves track plimsoll punks which honestly listen this song could grow on me in context of the entire record because I do think this is the best single the band has released so far and the more singles I hear from this forthcoming record the more passionate the lead vocals are the more engaging and captivating the guitar work is and the more it seems like the band is actually focusing on their craft of songwriting than just kind of getting lost in reverb e effects which previously was kind of my you know issue with their previous material yeah I mean you know all these not one of my favorite bands out there right now obviously but they could come into their own on this record over here and I'm hoping that that ends up being the case alright let's get into the tracks that really kind of hit me left an impact on me this week first off the new Tara mellow song trash generator this is exactly how I like nathrach over here it's kind of weird it's progressive it's left-field it's crazy some of the grooves and time signature work is just like really freaking odd the lyrics are freaking weird I just really like the the strange attitude the brand is bringing to the table on the new track over here and hope you enjoy it too got to give a shout out to the new proto martyr track I'm not gonna say too much about it because the album is coming out pretty soon and I've already talked about a few of their previous songs but you know these guys have a very low down dirty dark post-punk sound that I enjoy quite a bit continues on to this new track over here again which I highly recommend not going to talk a lot about this new track over here as well because the new Brock Hampton is coming out very very soon don't want to spoil too many thoughts on this new track and this forthcoming record however saturation - I'm expecting big things I'm expecting good things saturation one was amazing could be my favorite hip hop project of the year please do look up Brock Hampton saturation if you have not already and once you've listened to that get hype and get ready for saturation - because it's coming out very soon very very soon coming out this month August 25th I believe and this again latest single fantastic track Kevin abstract fucking kills it on this song and I'm just gonna leave it at that want to give a shout out to the new converge track under duress this track to me felt less like converged by the numbers in comparison with their last track the riffs were heavier I thought that the band sort of added some interesting dynamics to the song it didn't just kind of feel like they were you know kind of blazing through the track as aggressively as possible and just kind of leaving it that really kind of felt like they they added and wove some interesting passages into this song to kind of balance out the faster more aggressive moments quite a bit and honestly that and sort of the the the brutality and the noisiness and the harshness of converges and music those things in my opinion are truly what makes converge a special band so to kind of hear those elements return in a strong way on this new track over here was good I want to give a shout out to clipping who had a new song out titled the deep a track that I highly recommend if you enjoyed their last album I'm not sure how many people will enjoy this track who didn't like the new album or didn't hear the new album the thing about the new record is that it's a concept record a runaway slave on a space slave ship stranded in the middle of some galaxies somewhere that's literally the concept it's insane it's crazy however it's incredibly creative it is as far as a you know from a narrative perspective amazing from a production perspective like really colorful really textured really insane that a lot of the beats like try to give the listener this sense that they're inside of a spaceship or in space and this new single over here pretty much carries with those sonic themes and carries with those narrative themes too because a lot of what dahveed is rapping on this track sort of harkens back to a lot of the storyline and the details from that new album so you know there's kind of like an obviously there's a narrative connection there that kind of extends the storyline it's almost like a bit of an epilogue or something if you will it just like kind of adds more to the story sort of connect some more dots and highlights some more information for people who may have had questions like I did coming away from the album like you know how did this happen or how did that happen or you know what did this person think you know or like what exactly is sort of the context or sort of give you know give more of a deeper context for this so give a listen to this track especially if you love that new clipping album I want to give a shout out to the new car seat headrest song which is titled Wars coming if you want it this is one of a handful of songs that came out this past week sort of in response to the violence that had gone down at Charlottesville Virginia during that rally where you saw a clash of Nazis and KKK members and they all right with you know antiphon and leftists and unfortunately that woman that poor woman Heather was killed rest in peace this is one of the songs that sort of came out in response to that Wilco dropped one as well however out of all the song that sort of got dropped this was easily my favorite will kind of really pull together a great track here I don't know how much of it had been written prior to all of this or if this was written 100% in response to the thing instrumentally and lyrically it is a pretty powerful track and instrumentally I do think it's one of his more interesting songs and you know hopefully he continued sort of progressing I think he's doing some really interesting sort of almost progressive sort of passages and structures with his tracks like his songs are really deep and multifaceted and thoughtful and I love that he sort of continues to grow into that I want to give a shout out to the body and full of Hell who had a new collaborative record on the way believe it or not their last collaborative album I thought was pretty good and this new track over here titled earth is a cage is pretty much exactly why that collaborative record was so good and exemplifies once again why when these two come together and they collab on a track like it's so good I feel like full of hell brings a certain aggression and viscera and just momentum to a track that the body doesn't typically have you know certainly they're heavy certainly they're loud but I wouldn't exactly call their music throttling and the body brings a certain texture and sound and noisiness too full of hell's music that I don't feel like they have on their own they complement each other really well and it feels like they're kind of growing together on this new track over here because it is thunderous it is thundering it's thunder thunder thunder it's hellish it's heavy it's so so abrasive and ugly it is so bone crushing soul crushing every piece of your body being crushed down to the molecule it's powerful it's just enveloping it's claustrophobic how just in your face it is I just kind of really just surrounds you and smothers you with it's ugly oppressive sounds don't miss it because again it's powerful it's heavy and that is going to be the last track I believe that I wanted to reference here and that's going to be it so again all these songs are down there in the description don't miss out on them especially the best ones met tracks are pretty good the worst tracks you know at out of morbid curiosity do what you got to do also hit up that turntable a blink like I said Amazon Associates link shout out to that again click on that link anything you buy on Amazon we could kick back from it and once again I'm on tour

8rJxsKJm6KQ,hi everyone - they had tannin of sweat in the man tan oh it is so muggy outside here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new little be black ken mixtape little B is a California rapper and this is his long-awaited first mixtape he's billing it is like his first tape which if you know anything about the bass God at this point he has many mixtapes already in circulation however it's weird that this black Ken tape is coming out now because he teased and originally announced this tape years ago like over five years ago at this point back when I assumed that when it would eventually be released songs like my diary and I'm ready and dead presidents would be on it and I'm not sure what happened between then and now because none of that material from years ago has made it onto this tape I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing I mean just add it to the list of reasons why little B is raps biggest enigma now there are almost 30 tracks on this thing to average it 3 minutes and change so you're talking about a 90 minute project here but for some reason it was pretty easy to take this thing and a few sittings and commit much of it to memory I think because there wasn't anything too heady or deep or intricate or detailed about a lot of the lyrics flows and instrumentals truth be told little B's very amateurish and loose rap delivery is still very much intact on this thing you wouldn't think he's been rapping for as long as he has he still sounds very messy and off the cuff and hod he continues to break down the basic fundamentals of hip-hop music only to rebuild them in his own weird image but this black Ken tape pushes a little be even further into outsider territory because he produced the entire thing now this is not the first time we've heard little be produced or compose there was like that mostly instrumental new agey kind of classical Tears for God project also choices and flowers both of which were pretty much unlistenable black ken by comparison though I think is much better much more enjoyable even if the long-running instrumental introduction is very rough and not really that great but there's something about the production on this project that's really rickety it's unorthodox it's weird it's awkward a lot like little bees rapping and now that little bee has total control over the direction and the style of the instrumentals on a mixtape he goes into some really weird directions their grooves and drum patterns on this thing sound like they came right out of the late 80s like the song Berkeley or the song free life I mean these are just a couple of many tracks on this thing that sound like these long-lost Avant rap gems that are just now being resurrected in 2017 the very laid back ride has these very sparse strange and tense open space verses it's very quiet little bees delivery on this thing like borders on gentle spoken word but then the track miraculously like becomes funky within a beat or two as soon as the chorus pops in there are a few tracks on here the sound like these Bay Area bangers like a really weird bastardization of West Coast hip-hop club music the songs west coast and still run it sound like really bad but also kind of hilarious to pocket person ations and the songs ambos a brings a very unexpected Latin flavor to the project that did not anticipate and I didn't think would go over as well as it does not to say that little B has mastered the art of fusing hip-hop and Latin music together but it certainly comes together in a really unique way enjoyably unique and then to mention one more track there's the very sparse and weird and somewhat off-kilter track hiphop which I thought was important to note because of sort of the lyrical topic here and the title of the song despite the fact that little B has been making and listening to collectively for decades the art of rap music you would think that from the sound of this song that he had just heard about it last month it's a really weird scattered listen I can't say that little B doesn't keep it interesting and there are a lot of tracks on here that I legitimately enjoy listening to like the very raw exciting and kind of gritty and grimy ross rapper alive or the song the real is back on these cuts as well as others a little bit used to deliver some very personal lyrics also kind of continue to sort of extend this generally positive vibe across a lot of this tracks this based mentality but it is a little be you know that they're going to be corny lyrics on here case in point the song ghosts in yareta go I will admit though sometimes I enjoy this album more for what it represents or its context and what's actually doing I mean it certainly is a conversation starter like how is little bees music so persistently weird how does he continue to innovate as hip-hop's biggest and most major outsider in a time when weirdos are kind of reigning supreme you know little bee doesn't follow the rules and as a result of that he doesn't live up to the basic fundamentals of a hip-hop album the technical fundamentals yes okay yes but because he doesn't follow the rules he has a certain level of freedom that I don't hear in any other rappers music today case in point the song rare art which sonically lyrically stands as one of the freakiest and most odd hip-hop songs of the year but because of that lack of limitations and boundaries this is a really unruly and unfocused and inconsistent project a very inconsistent ninety minutes there are just as many annoying lows as there are creative highs and plenty of somewhat middle-of-the-road filler throughout the track listening to tracks that are really kind of redundant don't bring anything in terms of a different sound or a different style to the tracklist songs that run just a little bit too long it really is a struggle to listen to the entire thing and appreciate it as a cohesive project because it's just not I recommend though giving it a shot because it is really weird I think some of the little bees finest moments thus far land on this thing you just kind of need to hear it all out and pick through the tracks that appeal the most to you and just leave it at that I guess I'm feeling a decent strong five on this thing transition have you given this mixtape a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you're ready to hear the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry over here next to my head is another little bee review please check that out watch some more videos or click on the link to subscribe to the channel alright I'll catch you guys in the next one little bee black can mix tape ever 
6q7UpIFY6xg,uh this new little peep album it's not good tape is a California the New York rapper who is yet to drop a full-length commercial project until now part one of this come over when you're sober I first heard of this guy last year when I heard his Hellboy tape which I ranked as one of the worst projects of the entire year because of the way it hideously combined cloud wrapped with trap rap along with like some emo vocals and screaming and melodramatic lyrics then down the road I learned via pitchfork that little peep was in fact the future of emo the future of emo so of course my morbid curiosity got the best of me and I had to try this new project out too not that it wasn't getting requested it was and who knows maybe this time little peep he would wow me he would win me over I don't know why I have hope at this point that didn't that did make me gag a little but listen here's the thing this is a very short project it's just like seven tracks or so and given that it is part one I'm assuming that this is just like half of the album and I'm not assuming part two is going to change anything up significantly or anything like that but essentially what we have here on this thing is a series a very cloudy very mediocre very trappy production on this thing little peep over it when he is rapping it's usually just kind of a very subtle very monotone very lifeless sort of thing he's so despondent he's trying to convince you of how depressed he is he's such a tortured soul but yet his lyrics are so substance list they're so meaningless they're so vapid it's like he's depressed for the fashion of it and you know I may be a little too cynical here he may in fact have emotional problems and actually suffer from something like depression but if that's in fact the case why would he spend so much time on this project essentially fetishizing sadness fetishizing depression because the way he frames that it sounds like this sexy glassy moody fantasy not the literal mental hell that some people have to struggle with every day and that's why I say a lot of the lyrics and a lot of the song topics on this thing just boil down to melodrama cheap melodrama as peep dis Mons out sometimes a tonally because he's not a very good singer over these beats that routinely combine these strung out reverb guitars with the rattling high hats the sub bass the sharp 808 snares I think a lot of these instrumentals are okay they're decent but their style their sound their aesthetic is really a one-trick pony that little peep has totally exhausted by the end of these very short like 20 or so minutes well I feel like I'm listening to like a really bad 90s alt rock core sort of slipped into this horrible emo song that is somehow tripped over and fallen on top of this really trendy cloud rap production I guess at this point I don't entirely disagree with the categorization or even the prediction of little peep being the future of emo but it's really bad emo I mean this is the kind of emo that if it were thrown over these pop punky driving suite guitars 10 or 11 years ago today we would just be laughing at it but now that it's over at rap beat it's like hey you know what this is like this is this is the new thing when in actuality it's just kind of another sign that we've reached peak trap [Music] like the genre has been co-opted so awfully so many times that the sound is nearly meaningless at this point it's kind of like a meme that gets shared so many times it becomes so popular that even your mom thinks it's funny now nothing against the moms though shout out to the moms and I don't know man the the singing I really cannot tolerate it where I want and I'm not really sure if I can read these lyrics without laughing at least a little bit fuck my life can't say that girl don't tell me you can save that shit all she want is payback for the way I always crave that shit uh I don't know how anyone can listen to this and identify with it because it just sounds like such an act like I get being sad and wanting to listen to sad music but I just don't get even a whiff of authenticity to the moodiness of this record it just seems like I mean it's not like the new Mount Airy album which is literally so tangibly sad that sometimes I just want to avoid it and I don't want to have anything to do with it because it's it's just it's too much it just sounds like it's way to obsess with like trying to sound really cool I knew somebody who sort of acted and sort of dressed like this like you know he was super fashion punk and you know he was like oh man like life is life is suffering man life is just suffering needless to say we did we did not take this guy very seriously but that's essentially what this album feels like to me I've given that guy the ability to just talk my ear off for over 20 minutes and I'm looking for you know a reason to leave the room or escape without being like super rude oh whoa hey my friend just texted me here so he says that something about microwaves and vacuums and like going out of business and he says they're on the discounted price which is something that is interesting to me so I need to go call him take him up on that but uh but yeah this new little peep album it's it's a it's it's not good have you've given this album to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best

nubYmxtTlVk,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new richard dawson album peasant this is the latest full-length album from English folk singer Richard Dawson this thing is out now in Domino Records who he has released with on a few separate occasions and prior to this album to be completely honest I wasn't really familiar with Dawson's work all that much I just kind of got lured into this record because as a really weird cover and then when I actually heard I was surprised to hear a very experimental progressive somewhat freaky folk album and free folk can be kind of a tough listen some albums are kind of inspiring and beautiful and strange while others devolve into really noisy noodling grading vocals as well it gets kind of out there though I wouldn't exactly say freak folk is 100% Dawson style it's not the full embodiment of what he does in his music singer songwriters like Robert Wyatt come to mind at some points on this album there's something very primitive Estella Genting entery very strange experimentation all over the record I would say there are some moments where I get like maybe a whiff of Captain Beefheart but who isn't inspired by Captain Beefheart at this point to some degree but Dawson really does kind of strike a really nice balance between beauty and oddity on this record he has a very strange inflection it's kind of nasal it's yell P at points but he also sings like he is the oldest of souls the instrumentation gets pretty noisy as well the guitars the drums he plays his guitar in a really pronounced way on this album like he really plucks the strings hard on his guitar so they snap they rattle they pop it's almost like he's about to break his guitar on us every single song here and the recording is really intimate it's really raw slightly lo-fi a lot of ambient noise surrounding the instrumentation it just seems really in the moment really organic which made for a really enveloping listen and that's because the album feels like an actual moment a document of something that occurred in time not to some kind of studio project so while there is a lot of texture here some of the texture can get really ugly the beauty of these songs mostly in the shape of these like archaic English folk melodies that I don't know are moving they're touching also the very poetic lyrics and the wonderful harmonized background vocals to the instrumentation might be a little you know blemished but it's a it's a beautiful blemished this album runs an hour it's pretty uniform throughout but not necessarily in a bad way sometimes Richard works in some extra sounds to embellish the bass instrumentation of the album some strings some weird noises some extra precaution or vocal layers some shuffling instrumental noise to kind of give these tracks a very busy claustrophobic feel or the really like overbearing distorted bass notes on the song beggar following these tracks through they're very rustic and rootsy chaos is kind of like trying to maneuver your way through like a really busy crosswalk or a swamp and I feel like the clutter adds a lot to the grit and texture of the album the personality of the record and I guess beyond the instrumentation I just enjoy the style and the aesthetic of this record beyond that what makes the album so enjoyable just comes down to the individual songwriting quality of each track which for the most part is pretty dynamic even though the sound is super consistent across the album it just kind of makes the entire thing enjoyable even though it is an hour the song ogre which starts off very early on in the album trades off with these interesting passages of very intimate guitars and vocals then that's swapped out with these really captivating spots of like these layered very young vocals kind of singing in beautiful harmony the music toward the end climbs and climbs and climbs with a wonderful intensity to it then we have the very slow weary and gorgeous soldier which from the lyrics reads like a track about not wanting to go into battle and die because you'd much rather be with your loved to sort of give a bit of a timeframe here there's reference to you know using one's blade in the song to kind of give you a bit of a reference as to where and when this battle was happening and that's the thing I feel like with his music much of the time from the composition to the lyrics Richards really trying to take listeners back to really centuries and centuries ago we have a more visceral sound on the song Weaver which has kind of a very marching groove to it there's some very tense dark melodies we've the out this song to the awesome in large chorus vocals toward the end of the song are amazing I mean following through a lot of these songs like exploring like a long winding cave with secret passages and weird creatures long-lost history I mean there's so many facets and segments to these songs it's easy to get lost in them and just the way Richard Dawson uses his sound in his lyrics like channel this old English folklore so old it's it's with an e at the end o LD e like I'm a song prostitute we have the music taking like a theatrical turn Dawson and his lyrics is like playing a character singing about a like a child being sold for a year's worth of grain the music sounds like more medieval than usual on the entire record here so it's only fitting that like at the midpoint of this track he would throw in like this high-pitched noise e jeroni electronic glitch e's sort of bit in the song just kind of like add a little bit of noisy anachronism and then on the song scientists we have almost like a narrative one where Richard seems to be singing about like this guy this inventor who's trying to force this new piece of technology on to a group of townspeople under like the threat of violence and they're rejecting it in song at least that's how it reads you know I feel like there is something kind of esoteric about the way Dawson writes the stories of these songs where you kind of have to piece some of the story together the finger-picking and chord progressions take on almost like a Western and American tone on the song shapeshifter the playing the performance on that track is so hard it's so aggressive it sounds like again as I mentioned earlier that Richards guitar is about to snap in half not only that but the production is super noisy on this track and his vocals on this thing his falsetto vocals have almost like a sassy demeanor to them you know overall this is just a really strange and beautiful album with just a lot of enchanting tracks on it beautifully written uniquely recorded and a little eccentric - which I know is going to turn some people off of this album but if you like your singer-songwriters was kind of a weird flare to their performance and their writing style then this thing will most likely take you to the moon and back or like at least back to medieval times and not like a corny Renaissance Faire the way you know there are moments where I think some of these tracks could have been pared down a little bit the pacing on the song hobb is a little questionable I think masseuse didn't fully justify its 10-minute length despite the fact that the ending was pretty epic it is a pretty nice finish to the album overall but overall I think it's a very great very fantastic album feeling a strong strong strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what's your dire view next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just check out the album over here next to my head is a

MyQ0O5jlyoo,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the brand-new Milo album who called you to think who told you to think who told you to think bohemian rapper producer lyricist poet philosopher milo also known as scallops hotel now in his third full-length commercial album following up 2014's a toothpaste suburb and then 2015 so the Flies don't come which was surprisingly a very direct and a slightly aggressive direction for Milo to go in with his music and Milo's musical roots go back even further than that with a series of EPs and mixtapes and singles we've covered much of it here on the channel and my look pretty much evolved out of these very light-hearted very sweet personal deep ponderin tsa's of a myriad of different topics that were more cluttered than organized to a sound that comes off now a little bit more focused this hat is making my head hot a little bit more direct by comparison I think the album flies marked the discovery of a certain urgency that I was hoping would continue on to this new album over here and indeed it does even though on the surface maybe it seems a little bit more chill and relaxed a lot of the instrumentals on this thing are mellow slow jazzy hypnotic but Milo's delivery over them stays pretty steadfast and authoritative however he doesn't come to a lot of definitive conclusions on this album as he does with most of his projects Milo the eminent philosopher is always on the search for truth and meaning and subtext and listening to his lyrics generally including the lyrics on this new album over here I get the sense that his mind is just moving at a million miles an hour he's overwhelmed or at least trying to overwhelm the audience hitting them with one sort of spare thought or one liner after another tackling topics like technology and love ennui hip-hop his wife dreams blackness and given that it is Milo a lot of the language and the references on this album run pretty deep we'll get you getting out your dictionary or looking up Wikipedia to see what from Russian literature is he referencing or what from Canadian post-rock is he referencing and most of these very tangled and very dense thoughts play out across these 1 to 3 minute tracks on this album many of which feel like little hip-hop vignettes and are not structured in a traditional fashion by any means which should not be new to any Mylo listeners at this point I mean since the earliest days of him releasing music at least into solo capacity he has had a weird relationship with the verse and the chorus being more content to turn his songs into these winding musical quests where he challenges the listeners need for familiarity and Milo understands that this makes his music difficult to digest for some newcomers I mean there's even a bar on the track take advantage of the naysayer where Milo says working titles of my autobiography I'm probably not the rapper for you still though I think Milo has gotten slightly better working outside of the expectations of song structure whether it be him stringing together these very short but funny detours in the track listing like the song idk or bringing the audience through a series of really weird sonic and lyrical detours before hitting them with one of the finest verses on the entire album on the song pablum and Celeste king I think Milo's flows on this thing I've got a little more consistent and rhythmic as well especially on the cuts that featured guest rappers many of whom are really impressive and add a lot to the record however Milo still does break into these vocal passages on this album from time to time where he's sort of bordering on spoken word which has sort of been his trademark thing up until this point but really he does set his rap skills up on this thing just as he had on the album flies and again to reference the features on this thing because I think they add a lot to the record I love the posse cut on this thing I enjoy self Jupiter on this record of course elusive of Arm & Hammer fame bus driver of course is on this thing and maybe the only guest who I was sort of on the fence with was young man who was on the track the young man has a point and I don't know like his verse was kind of gritty but then there was also something weirdly awkward about it and I guess as long as I'm complaining this project is a little bit longer than so the Flies don't come which is not necessarily that thing but I feel like the overall project has sort of a bit of a Noah sonic and a lyrical uniformity to it that I don't know kind of makes it a little bit of a drag at points this is kind of what also made toothpaste suburbs somewhat lackluster in my opinion while the album does have its highlights there are a lot of spots that to me just overall felt very gray not a lot of emotional peaks and valleys and given the brevity of some of these tracks it's not like many of them leave a long lasting impression or go into their subject matter so deeply that I come away all that satisfied because there are a lot of moments on this thing that just kind of fade out very suddenly or just kind of fizzle it's the case for much of the middle point of the album I would say the record starts off very strong with a good handful of tracks and I think finish is very strong to what you have a lot of the guest rappers coming through and you know laying down some verses and I think there's a certain point on the album where the production grows a little less mystical to like gets a little blander it kind of has this vague jazz enos the beats aren't quite as groovy or hard-hitting the music becomes a lot less entrancing I would say that's the case for naysayer bill none idk as well as the song sorcerer though generally I do like the very enveloping production on this album and truly to appreciate the occasional stuttering psychedelic vocal edit that Milo works into this thing as I said the album does really start to shape up again toward the end and in my eyes sort of finishes off with the tragically sad embroidering machine after which we kind of get this long pause of like a record skipping or sort of playing out at the very end and sort of repeating itself over and over and over before the song rapper comes in featuring bus driver which for all intents and purposes to me sounds like a bonus track and not a bad bonus track I mean it certainly is a highlight on the album for me but given its placement it's kind of hard seeing it as reinforcing anything else the rest of the album overall I thought this is a good record from Milo I think he stagnated a little bit creatively artistically treaded water in a sound that I think he has already explored to its fullest extent still though there were a lot of highlights on here where I saw his skills improving I saw him dropping a lot of very clever funny intriguing one-liners you know Milo is one of these artists who within one single track can drop a whole verse that makes you laugh makes you want to cry makes you want to thank and I think he mostly succeed that his goal of coming through with a thought-provoking heady abstract hip hop album there are some moments on the album that I just wish were a little bit more fleshed out and developed I wish he took some more risks because Milo is an artist who I think gets eaten up in the minutiae of some things to the point where he forgets to challenge himself on a grander scale but all that being said I'm feeling the light too decent 7 on this thing enjoyed it quite a bit transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it here the best you're the best which would I review next hit like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry just leave angry calm in the comments if you're angry over here next to my head is a review of Milo's previous album check that out click on that watch

So6aG1iLdjg,hi everyone raised to be botan oh here interred as busy as music nerd and it's time for review the new Ke$ha album rainbow I'm so excited I don't even know why Ke$ha is a California singer pop song stress who broke in 2010 with an album of very huge mostly obnoxious club anthems that I could never really get into honestly no such luck with her follow-up album warrior either honestly when it came to her music I never really paid all that much attention to Ke$ha because nothing that I ever heard really intrigued me you know outside of some pretty good collaboration she had done with the Flaming Lips but even I was kind of engrossed in the very nasty lawsuit that was going on between Ke$ha and her primary producer dr. Luke which originally came as a surprise for me because from what I understood they had a pretty close working relationship with Luke producing a bulk of her two albums but then back in 2014 Kesha hit Luke with a lawsuit accusing him of sexual assault sexual battery sexual harassment even going as far to say that he drugged her as well as emotionally abused her Luke responded with a defamation lawsuit saying that Kesha and her mother merely wanted her out of a record contract and was their motivation for that possibly I mean going as far back as 2013 there were rumors of Luke stifling Kesha's creative process and limiting the input that she had in her own albums and things get even more complicated with a 2011 deposition that kind of contradicts Cash's reasons for initiating the lawsuit in 2014 the judge also said given the time frame of one of Kesha's claims it was outside of the statute of limitations it seemed like Kesha wasn't going to get any legal redemption out of this however as recently as April Sony has cut ties with dr. Luke and I can only imagine the company would make that move if there was some kind of substance to these allegations because dr. Luke is not really in the public eye he works for tons of different very popular artists and he could have easily gone back into the shadows from this and just continued writing hits and producing his Christmas and in the long run Sony is going to make way more money with a dr. Luke than they are a Kesha unless he is essentially a ticking time bomb who is too much of a risk for the company to have on the payroll because you don't just throw out a dr. Luke for no reason I mean the guy is responsible for some of the biggest pop hits of the past 10 or so years but you know that's just me kind of supposing based on what has been reported and put out there publicly I don't typically get this deep into these types of things in preparation for a review but it's kind of essential for this album given that this whole debacle really paints and informs the mood and the lyrics throughout much of this album and Cash's newfound artistic freedom on this record has led her down some really interesting musical pathways like there are a few all guns blazing balls-to-the-wall rock tracks on this thing a few country cuts one track featuring a big soulful horn section from Deftones records owned at Kings and with more piano and acoustics and organic instrumentation and lyricism on this album ketch is sounding surprisingly mature and personal on this thing however this record is still very much Kesha as she says on the song boots she is a roland stoner on a roll she's still that empowered party girl but her musical approach this time around is just a bit more nuanced and that is very much a good thing I've never actually heard Kesha sound like she has so much conviction on a song and there were a few tracks on this thing where I really came away impressed with their vocal abilities - like I didn't know she could sell really like emotionally sell a song this much I was pretty impressed right from the intro to this thing on the song bastards which is this intimate acoustic ballad not as big and over-the-top as you sort of expect Kesha to be right out of the gate the song has a tried and true chord progression a pretty passionate chorus and the message of the song is essentially what hits home and really kind of sets the tone for the entire album don't let the bastards get you down don't let the assholes wear you out don't let the mean girls take your crown the song has a very big Hey Jude sort of sized finish at the very end complete with Nonna's and hayes it's not a downer of an intro or anything like that far from it it's actually really feel good and inspiring this track transitions really interestingly into hard-hitting and very punky let him talk on this track Ke$ha sounds authoritative and decisive over these really driving guitars and one two drum beats that the Eagles of Death Metal bring the instrumental is surprisingly hard given that it's supposed to be the sound bed for a pop diva however the hyper melodic chorus just slips in really seamlessly and sweetens the deal quite a bit and I don't know she's really hard not to get wrapped up in the infectious bliss of this song with the performance and the really bright mix the song woman is a track that originally turned me off a little bit as a single however the instrumental has grown on me by leaps and bounds I love the groove I love the sassy horns and very decisive piano I love the moment when Ke$ha breaks down laughing in the lead-up to the second chorus it sounds like she and the band is just having a lot of fun recording this cut there are a lot of empowerment cliches on this track it's pandering of the highest order yes however I do kind of like the take away message on this song that Cash's body her love her attention is not for sale she's her own person the following track him changes up the musical vibe into something more smooth synthetic has really deep murky synthesizers this very sparse skeletal beat some finger snaps it sounds like a little bit of Lord influences rubbing off on Ke$ha here except Ke$ha is playing with Lorde slightly older sound bringing a more sparkly chorus and I think by comparison Ke$ha is a more capable singer but where I really feel like this song falls short is in the whole substance Department it feels kind of like a tribute to atheists kids or outsiders but what they're on the outside of I don't know or maybe it's some kind of generational statement and that's kind of the problem the target of the song is not really all that clear it just seems really general it's like Ke$ha was really shooting for a track that was life-affirming but didn't have anything life-affirming to say still the song sounds pretty and certainly fits really well into the flow of the record I was really impressed with the song praying when I initially heard it as a single still very impressed with it within the context of the record God it is still an amazingly powerful piano ballad and the lyrics it's even clearer now just how much Kesha is focusing on dr. Luke and essentially the whole trauma of this trial saying that he better be praying and that is so better be changing and given the emotional weight of the topic of this song some of the biggest and best vocal highlights of the entire record turn up here and I really love the structure of the song I love how it just slowly gets more powerful and more powerful as it kind of goes into each phase I love the mixing the balance of the lead vocals the piano the choral vocals which are gigantic the song is huge in every sense of the word in its message and its emotion in its instrumental presentation and it's it's just an amazing highlight on the album a lot of the themes on this cut are reiterated on the very peppy and freeing learn to let go which are reiterated again on the much slower and more extravagant rainbow while I do love the glamorous instrumentation on this cut and I do think the album could have used another slow burner this is easily the most mild of all of them and didn't really strike me as as memorable to be completely honest past this point on the album though it seems almost like Ke$ha is kind of exercised and emotional demon so now she sort of allows herself to indulge in more lighthearted topics like love and old love and young love and crazy love like on the song boots or being in love with Godzilla on the song Godzilla which is really playful and hilarious acoustic on the record where Ke$ha takes Godzilla to the mall and to her mom pretty much being in love with a figurative or a literal monster who I guess other people don't see the appeal in other than Ke$ha it's easily the cutest and most endearing moment on the entire record however the fun on this thing kind of turns borderline obnoxious on the song boogie feet got even to say the title which is kind of this white girl banger with blaring guitars of course the Eagles of Death Metal are back on this one on the verses here Ke$ha brings us really snobby cheerleader flow she talks like this every time she goes to sing up lying in the verse she the Eagles bow kind of down it's out the ridiculousness of this track with like a good groove and some slightly gritty punky guitars it's it's a silly song it's it's almost like too ridiculous to take seriously but I don't know I wouldn't be surprised if with more lessons that won me over however right from first listen I loved the country direction of tracks like hunt you down which was really cheeky and the song featuring Dolly Parton on your old flames cache is somehow knocks it out of the park with these two completely unexpected country cuts she just has like kind of this natural twang to her voice that plays really well to this style certainly her collaborating with an older singer went over much better than it did when Lana Del Rey invited Stevie Nicks on to her new album and honestly I think Kesha sounds more convincing over these kinds of instrumentals and even Lady Gaga did when she was dabbling in the Mojo an Kesha is just trying a lot of different things on this record and she's excelling it almost all of them and it's just like man but I can't wait for you to continue with your musical adventures in the future the finishing song spaceship has a pretty cute sentiment to it I love this whole idea of feeling so weird and alienated in this world where in your place in the world so you've kind of like cooked up this idea this fantasy in your head where there's going to be a spaceship coming back to pick you up and I don't know just the belief the sense of belief Kesha puts into this track that this is like actually going to happen it's like really convincing I love the folky backing instrumentation on this cut - it just kind of makes the song and the whole idea of the song sound even cuter and sweeter than it actually is which in reality it's actually like a little weird it's nearly a perfect finish to the album if not for the nauseating closing spoken word passage on the song where cash is talking about like unit like being Stardust and stuff it's it's really like one of the lowest points on the record and you know it's not a perfect album I didn't go into this thing expecting a perfect album I don't know anyone who did however this record really exceeded my expectations by quite a bit because previously I had never been a fan of Kesha honestly but I did not expect this record to be filled with so many sweet catchy well written fantastically produced and inspiring songs I mean even at its worst this record is still kind of hard not to like it's a really smart artistic reinvention with Kesha pretty much maintaining the fun wild energy that made her appeal to her fans in the first place and hopefully she can move forward from here continue to evolve continue to try new things continue to push those limits vocally because I feel like even here we're not hearing the most of Kesha's vocal potential I'm feeling a decent strong seven on this thing to transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it here the best you're the best what should I do next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comma in the comments if you're angry over here next to my head is a review of the last Lady Gaga album click on that watch that video check out that video or you can click on the link to subscribe to the channel and I will catch you guys in the next video Kesha rainbow forever I am

it brings you to a page of a bunch of colorful pressings of records that I have reviewed on the channel you can also buy turntable equipment speakers audio stuff for the budding audio file or record collector who you may know or yourself and let's get into the worst tracks of the week I'm kidding of joking there are no worse tracks this week actually surprisingly I literally combed through all the songs that I thought were major and needed discussing this week and I didn't really think any of them were god-awful or terrible to be completely fair I mean I'm dead serious like of course there's like some terrible top 40 crap that dropped this week but of stuff that I felt like you know you guys really needed to know about or be aware of nothing really hit me is like being stinky so we're going to get right into the tracks that we're kind of man not awful but certainly worth mentioning and recommending to guys again all the stuff is linked down there in the description first off let's kick it with the new Enter Shikari track believe it or not and while I've never been a fan of this band before this track is pretty great it's called live outside and you know not the the usual loud gimmicky silly and annoying sound Jakari usually comes through with on a track this is way smoother more danceable almost futuristic and certainly the music video kind of plays that angle too in a way the band kind of remained it reminded me of everything everything on this thing and and come to think of it maybe they were kind of influenced by them on this track it's totally within the realm of possibility you know sort of funky polyrhythmic futuristic oddly sung like sort of on the cutting edge pop music that's super catchy and you know has some beep sort of somewhat on a philosophical ponderings in the lyrics and again that sort of seems to be the case with this track yeah and just now in my head that everything everything connection is sort of becoming a parent and the it wouldn't be surprised surprising to me if they ended up sort of inspiring this cut next got to get a shout out to this new doom or Sean price track Adult Swim is coming out with a series of doom or MF doom tracks over the course of the next few weeks until it sort of completes this like weird doom notebook slash b-sides project I was kind of excited when I heard it announced but then once I heard it's like extra stuff it's notebook stuff it's b-sides stuff I was a little less psyched because a lot of dooms core sort of you know original material lately has been a little lackluster you know never mind the extra stuff that mostly seems like it's going to be on this compilation album and that certainly seems to be the case with this I'm like matching with this cover right now and that's awesome shout out to Bay for my new tie-dye shirt ok now that we've sort of gone on a detour let me continue what I'm actually hearing on this track listen it's okay you know the Sean price versus good re P Sean price the beat is fine dooms performance on the back end of the song is pretty decent too it's just not like you know illuminating or like an aha moment that I used to have when I listened to his older stuff you know again it sounds like what it is it sounds like extra stuff that sounds like b-sides stuff you know however as a doom fan you know of course I want to hear of course I'm morbidly curious of course you know I enjoy it but like if I'm going to come on here and recommend it to you I'm not going to tell you it's the greatest thing you've ever heard I'm not going to tell you what some of his best material because it just simply is not you know it's just alright it's just extra stuff but you know for the doom fans and I'm sure there are a lot of them out there hit at that link below and you can sort of follow along with every new track in this sort of upcoming sort of slowly released compilation moving on from there I want to give a shout out to this new EP from Aesop Rock & homeboy Sandman with this amazing cover over here sort of you know a bit of a play on Simon & Garfunkel triple fat lice this is another installment their kind of lice EP collaborative series thing and I don't know they really complement each other like I'm happy to see these two continuing to work together you know I feel like Sandman's laid-back sort of style and Aesop rocks typically wordy and very intense sort of delivery you know fit pretty well together there's a nice sort of dynamic there between both of them the production is very good and the link down below in the description box is to the entire EP so you know once you click on that you can hear the whole thing moving on from their new national track which is titled Karen at the liquor store I'm actually kind of positive toward this latest crop of national tracks like of course they are slightly underwhelming like I typically am when I go into a national song but I feel like the lead vocals are more tangible than they've been in a long time on a national album the balladry is pretty nice the backing instrumentation rather than kind of being vague and washy is a I guess very vivid and very lush though it may be very slow and may be very patient there's something very beautiful about it I'm sort of anticipating that maybe this new album once all these tracks come together hit me and I don't know just comes in here cross my fingers hoping that that's the case that you know these songs while they have been decent to good maybe with more lessons they'll grow on anymore because they all sound like slow burners you know they're slow burners as hell so I don't know just kind of hoping for that Liam Gallagher for what it's worth a new track new song ballad from Liam it's okay you know the melody coming out of the vocals on this one is pretty decent the tone of the lyrics is very confessional and personal I think more personal than he's been in a long time however I find the instrumental just you know to be a little bit bland here it's kind of your run-of-the-mill Britpop sort of affair but you know certainly hardcore Liam and Oasis fans will probably enjoy the vulnerable state that he's in on this song it's certainly not an angle that we see him at at least not lately anyway I'm moving on from there a new track from the horrors that I'm enjoying a little bit I could be won over by this track in the coming weeks you know right now I think it's kind of decent the vocals are hitting me as a little so so but the horrors coming through with like a really weird alternative dance style on this thing and it's a pretty long song so there are a lot of like funky passages with like some good beats on this thing the track that I'm pointing out here is something to remember me by kind of catchy hook on this one too but I'm sort of liking the late 80s and 90s all dance sort of aesthetic the band is going for on this one it certainly suits them a little bit better when they bland it out their sound for a spacey or shoegazing rock sound I think they're doing this style a little bit more justice and I kind of matched with discover too moving on from there ASAP ferg with me goes nasty who dat um you know I would say banger alert if not for the fact that some of the auto-tune singing vocals on this thing are slightly annoying me goes on the track are decent you know still I kind of feel like I'm listening to this new ASAP ferg material and that he's still stuck a little bit in limbo like how is he going to rebound after that horrible like attempt at trying to do a truly commercial wreck on always striving prosper like to me you know he's never going to come out with another with another trap Lord I feel like that ship has kind of sailed and like the iron is no longer hot on that and it feels like he's trying to go back to a harder more direct more gritty sound but it's really just not coming together as exciting as originally was you know the new material has been decent but I'm just not seeing what is so exciting about it but I don't know I guess we'll kind of see if it comes together forms like Voltron once the album is out moving on from there got to give a shout out to the new destroyer track titled skies gray new destroyer album on the way this track was kind of interesting it's sort of like a two-part song it's a very Spacey very subtle very somber and very patience testing intro and then once the instrumentation kind of forms and you get a good beat and groove behind it in the second half it really starts to come together I can't say that I was completely won over by it with my first impressions but with destroyer you know Dan he writes this really heady really poetic really thought-provoking and very patient music it's a kind of difficult to render any one song out of many of his albums down to a single and you know this is kind of I think that problem exemplifying itself right here on this new track over here I'll say it's decent for now but uh you know ready for it - maybe Wow me a little bit more once I hear it on the entire album this new track from Compton rapper buddy with Kate Renata was pretty smooth and pretty enjoyable like I've never heard of this rapper before maybe many of you haven't either but he just dropped this new project that is an entire EP of his Kate Renata beats and him from what I understand I could be wrong on that but that's what I read about it I haven't heard the other tracks on the EP or anything like that but this cut over here was pretty catchy pretty smooth I think it reached a point of repetitiveness and tediousness like toward the end of the song like it could have used the change-up in flow or lyrics because a the hook really was kind of wearing itself a little thin but I'm kind of curious as to to see what the rest of these collaborative tracks come out like because you know certainly there was a great potential in them coming together in this cut over here and I want to give a shout out to the new Alice glass song which I need to remind myself is titled without love some people were kind of crapping on this track when they sent it to me and telling you oh man you're gonna hate the new Alice glass song you're going to your inner rant and rave against it once you hear it and you do a best and worst track segment on it but honestly like I feel like Alice's return over here to putting out music came closer to the original peel the original appeal of Crystal Castles music then Ethan did when he started putting out music post Alice glass with Crystal Castles like I feel like this is more on the mark sure you know it's a little modernized with the trap beat in the background and everything and Alice's vocals aren't quite as obscured as they used to be when she was singing with Crystal Castles but I feel like that smooth digital Spacey glossy and beautiful kind of tone and aesthetic that made Crystal Castles so great to begin with it's here in full force you know obviously some changes and some alterations have been made given that it's a solo project but again I feel like Alice has really kind of checked a lot of the boxes is it one of the best songs of her this year no but I'm actually going into this new forthcoming Alice glass project with more Hope than I certainly was the forthcoming Crystal Castles album when I originally heard those new singles a while back so yeah I mean I'm relatively positive on this track not one of my favorites of the week but certainly not as terrible as some people sort of built the song up to be in my opinion a best tracks this week I know that was a lot of songs in the mass section but I really don't think any of them are all that bad honestly oh and um one song that for some reason did not make it into the list over here that I want to give a shout out to I want to get a shout out to the new Tori Amos song up the creek the production might be a little busier and maybe more electronic that then I would have liked out of a new Tori Amos but it's actually not a bad track some of the piano playing is amazing of course you know that's just Tori's main acts that's where she excels and the songwriting is pretty good too you know I don't really have too much more to say about outside of that oh there it is in the best section somehow made it over here I think that was a little bit of a typo I apologize but honestly I mean it is it is a good ass track you know don't miss it so it's a pretty good song all right moving on from there I want to give a shout out to the band street sex who have the new EP on the way via the flexor records for those of you who enjoyed the noisy industrial intense and very abrasive sound of the band's last album and position which was one of my favorite records of the year that is not the case on this new cut over here but it is still very good the industrial tone is still here the electronic tone is still here the rock elements are still here but it's way more subtle and it's way more somber think like some very early 9 inch nails or some early ministry but given that it is Street sex it's very experimental it's very odd you know Nine Inch Nails is not the most odd and experimental industrial group out there obviously but I just kind of use it as a comparison for an obvious point of reference that a lot of you will be familiar with you know go into this expecting something a little bit more I don't know in despair I guess and slow-burning moving on from there I'm enjoying this material that I'm hearing from this new rapper on Don Giovanni records of all places Don Giovanni being a place that typically puts out tracks from like indie rock bands punk bands underground rock bands garage rock and that sort of thing and they've been dropping material from this rapper named sameness and this new cut over here is titled qualified featuring open mike eagle and it's this kind of beautiful intense track about the push and pull of love and a relationship and kind of physical attraction and sex open mike eagle brings a lot to the song too she's a very passionate rapper with a good flow a lot of conviction to her delivery and her vote and her voice and her vocals and I'm just looking forward to hearing that kind of play on more songs over here I'm just really intrigued and really impressed by what little material I'm hearing so far and very happy to see Don Giovanni sort of branch branching out and trying different things really kind of reaching outside of their typical genre variety and experimenting a little bit got to give a shout out to the new Queens of the Stone Age track which I will say I did enjoy to grit me a little bit harder than their last single this song over here being the evil has landed this track has some pretty good riffs on it pretty good grooves longer song to about six minutes so it does have some interesting and the very cool winding passages and surprises toward the end of the track and some vocal harmonies all over this thing that kind of strike me as being like a little bit I don't know psyche rock or psych pop inspired like I'm hearing something out of the 60s but it kind of has a you know hard kidding hard-hitting gruffness and groove to it like you know the the open road rock of Steppenwolf or something like that but of course you know with um Queens of the Stone Ages usual moodiness and darkness that they bring to a track there's kind of a mix of a lot of different sounds and influences on this cut and liking the songwriting liking that it's just a little bit more hard-hitting than the last cut too and you know hopefully uh I can get more of a sense with what exactly the direction this album is going in is with another single you know because at this point well I have liked the two tracks thus far I'm just really not sure what to expect from this new album you know honestly truly but uh you know it'll be exciting to sort of see how it all comes together on this new album and of course I forgot to talk about this track last week because I'm a dumb-dumb want to give a shout out to the new Primus song the seven or the desaturating seven which is a really odd track for Primus not only does it feel like they're kind of going back to their Frizzle FRA roots a little bit like the recording is very sort of toned down not super heavy not super not super overpowering but they've kind of gotten back into that kind of quirky sort of groove sort of thing it's not overly gimmicky or off the wall or tongue-in-cheek or silly and the lyrics obviously are sort of talking about at least from what it seems like to me I don't know almost like like an oligarchy or an aristocracy of some sort of like really greedy people who are controlling the world or controlling everything you know just kind of feed their power feed their ego that sort of thing it's really dark song and I'm sort of intrigued by the way that the verse kind of shifts into the chorus it's almost like the verse has a really sort of consistent marching groove to it which is something that Primus is not new to you know something they've experimented with before and then once like the course kind of pops in they sort of hit into this 7/4 time signature and it's like the chorus is like less hard-hitting than the verse so rather than kind of like hitting you with a large and in charge hook it's like it kind of just turns and does boo boo did it like with a really cool bass line and it's just like a really interesting progression it's cool to hear Primus experimenting again in such a way where they're not trying to take it overboard with the same enos and instead they're just kind of hitting you with really interesting musical ideas I guess is where I'm coming from on this cut liking this track quite a bit and it's got me intrigued for where the band is going next as opposed to you know some of their more recent material loving the new primitive man song my will forthcoming album on the way link down below and God does this thing sound heavy and hellish and hard and ugly I mean I've known these guys were a good doom band before and I've caught them live once but I feel like the sound they bring on this record goes a little bit beyond that doesn't just typically this isn't just your typical slow dumi heavy you know primal metal track you know they're elements of death metal coming out of the vocals the chord progression and God is the mix on this thing loud and abrasive and heavy I mean it borders on noise you know sort of like that band Indian that sort of you know did a bit of a do me sludgy thing before they broke up I believe and or was it I'm trying to remember if it was a Indian or that other band or the United a collaborate it I could be totally wrong on that excuse me I'm totally up and messing up here but a you know it reminds me of Indian a little bit in its heaviness and simultaneous noisiness but it seems like the primitive man is just layering on those extra like sort of extra little sort of sections of guitar noise and distortion just to make it so much thick e'er thicker Basie or heavier it's really intense and it's really crushing and I kind of love the sensation that I'm getting out of the sound of it I've got to give a shout out to the new igloo ghost track excuse me bug thief of course Eagle ghosts new album on the way this is one of the artists out there right now who I've been dying to hear a full-length album from ever since I heard this guy's EP not too long ago on brain feeder records which I reviewed a little while ago look it up in the video catalogue if you can because it's a really good EP and unhappy with the review too but of course like I don't know I kind of feel like I'm almost watching an episode of adventure time when I watch or when I listen to a goose music I feel like I'm transferred or transported rather or teleported to this other colorful world of like insanity you know it's so sugary and it's so sweet and it's so inventive and I never want to leave and it's so welcoming and it's so dizzying and detailed and amazing and it also just kind of it feels familiar and yet it feels like I'm in a place I've never been before it's kind of crazy the sensation that I get out of this guy's music he's such a creative producer and I just cannot emphasize that enough moving on from there higher brothers with this new track over here which I'm going to probably butcher the pronunciation of bleed the dong wid dong would read the dumb lead the dong yeah I'm totally ruining that I apologize but bang earlier this is the best higher brother song I've heard so far this is like out of all the singles that I've heard recently I would say this is V single like this is a really fun track obviously some trap rap from the far east essentially going on here just very catchy chorus you know if the language barrier is a thing for you you know obviously there are some freaking subtitles on the video too but the flows are pretty decent too you know overall takechi track and I think obviously you know they're artists outside of the US right now who are making some noise and hip-hop music and I think that kind of needs to be noticed and you know certainly a higher brothers are one of those groups and I want to give a shout out finally to the new Brockhampton tracks swamp which is one of those amazing cuts from saturation one where it's not a hard-hitting track I'm not saying this is on saturation what I'm saying like you know comparatively it's it's like one of those cuts from saturation one where it's not a super hard-hitting cut but the hook is just so fantastic and there's like a smooth amazing melodic lick in the instrumental to that sort of enhances the catchiness of the track as well I don't know man just the rap verses on this thing are great the flows are fantastic the performance is all-around or good you know happy with the lyrics as well but I don't know man just brackhampton has this knack for writing incredibly catchy sort of alternative rap songs that are just so enjoyable and I don't know I'm just like really excited to to listen to saturation to and you know sort of hopefully the group gets another amazing project under their belt and that's going to be that that is our weekly track roundup for this week guys again all of that I've talked about is a down there in the description box along with our amazon associates link our turntable lab link to hit up the good people over at see geek down there because they sponsored this

recommendations out of this I love you ww4 
PBqjFihluag,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music and nerd and it's time for a violent date where I let you guys know the vinyl releases that have sort of recently gone into my record collection over here it's been a while since I've done a vinyl update and this isn't even half of the records that I have procured since I did my vinyl of my last vinyl update so I'm actually kind of really sorry that I have not kind of vinyl update recently but I just had a lot to do lately a lot to catch up on haven't had the time to put a lot of records on the record player until recently and that's why I'm doing this vinyl update over here cool cool alright um let's get into it I don't even know where to put this stuff as of right now okay let's just let's just put it all on my lap whoo and start off with something that is super rare a limited edition volume to 2017 shoo-shoo and Heidi Hahn artist Heidi Hahn coming together for a 7 inch over here which is also paired with a print that Heidi did so it's kind of like it's it's kind of like a double double deal sort of thing the print itself is pretty cool I think at some point I will frame it I forgot who sent this to me or how I came into it I apologize for that for being a Dumbo and there's like a certificate on the back to sort of notify that this is number 25 of 200 so I don't know if you can get your hands on this it's pretty nice there's a very strange and odd and very disturbing sort of noise and spoken word and drone and spoken word piece on the a side of this seven-inch which is like this really cool orange and black print and then on the B side of this thing for whatever reason there's like a xylophone cover of mozart's Turkish March which is actually a good song I think it's a good piece of classical music but sort of unexpected and yes I mean it's basically kind of like a bit of a sort of like an explanation of you know each of the tracks on the 7-inch and you know Heidi Hahn sort of uh having a little explanation here of the the sort of art print that came with this thing but a really cool sort of rare little double sort of collaborative collaborative art piece here so shout out to Shu Shu and Heidi Hahn on that hopefully there's still some of these available so people can get this once they see this video because it is kind of a cool little package and again I will sort of put an effort to get that framed moving on from there shout out to the band crying I got this like last year it's like 40 this is my favorite albums the last year this how long has been since I've talked about some of my vinyl releases that I picked up um but this album is really fun listening to on record I did not get the impression that it was as low Phi as it was when I had heard it digitally which is actually like kind of a nice surprise you know and that's the thing about vinyl some albums sound exactly like they do on a CD or as they do on an mp3 and some records really kind of gain an entirely fuller newer sound which you actually listen to them on a record and this is definitely one of those examples in my opinion you know pretty straightforward sleeve over here with a little bit of poetry it seems right there some liner notes over there I like the sleeves sort of has the printed crying sort of a name on the back over there with a Stereogum quote shout out to Stereogum and shout out to run for cover records for putting this band out and putting this record out because it is a fantastic record it's a very fun angular mathy twee piece of indie rock that's a very sharp very creative and I love this sort of a color here you know it's not even like um it's not a splatter it's more like a dusting sort of like the color of the the sort of light blue or the white that sort of is poured into the red it's like a dust it's like a weird sort of dusty kind of pattern to it it's very nice on the eyes love the red color love the way that the dusty sort of color contrasts with it very nice pressing sounds great again very Bayesian full and I'll say one more time not quite as low Phi as as sort of came off listening to it digitally let me actually put it the right way thank you put it up put it back okay there we go all right moving on from there a shout out to my dude Kieren J Kalinin his record label sent me this after I did the review of the album which was a very very nice of them and if you own this if you own this you know what I'm looking at right now actually let me let me let me let me put it this way here we go there's the inner sleeve I cannot show you the bottom of the inner sleeve right here okay I cannot show you the bottom so I have the the this part sort of covering it I cannot show you the rest of this I'll just put it that way but he is bronzed and looking just as brown as a leather couch that he is on and some of the bronzer is clearly coming off on the leather couch he is really shiny it's kind of gross looking and we have a lyric sheet on the inner sleeve over here and the vinyl is a very heavy pressing like it is a very heavy pressing it has to be 180 gram and it's just a pretty straightforward black record with a nice sort of watery ER sort of marbled blue labeling right there sort of match with the rest of the cover art and you know the record itself is very basic it's very heavy it's very full it's very funky and groovy and that is sort of enhanced with you know a little bit of a bass boost that you typically get on a record this one I haven't even opened yet because I've heard it a million times and I haven't put it on the record player yet but I just picked this up served after I did my um my MF DOOM worst to best because while I do have my reservations with this record listening back to it did make me kind of miss it and you know regret having given up my CD copy of the album back in the day when I did made me feel like a Dumbo and you know obviously this comes with the danger doom II that they put out later and some b-sides and extra stuff and obviously since I'm opening right now I have not put it on the record player yet but because I've heard it so many times I'm sure it sounds fine sure sounds great but oh wow cool damn this is a nice a nice sort of like triple LP gatefold deal we have going on here that is very cool it was a very nice danger doom this I believe is just going to be is probably this one a and b side b side a the other one is probably going to be you know disc 2 the other one's probably going to be a the the the EP that they put out of sort of extra tracks together I don't know what Elm and I got this so that they're still copies of this in circulation el chupanibre perfect hair two corn dogs skit - Sofa King remix space hos mad lib remix mad nice featuring Benny price spokesman so they're some of the extra tracks right there but nice man wow I didn't even know this is a triple LP that's really awesome I cannot wait to actually give a listen to this when I do get a chance but very very pleased with that that's an epic gatefold and all the records seem really heavy this is like a monstrous sort of package right here shout out to one of my favorite records of the year video sound machine hey you got to give a listen to this thing it's indie tronic it's funky it's a new wavy it's dance punky a huge elements of Afro be in the music as well um you know singing in the video in the video language for most of the LP really fun album really funky full and sort of a cool blend of sort of electronic and acoustic elements in the band's music check out my review of this record please I really don't know what else to say about it other than that you know that basing us that funkiness is again it sort of really enhanced with the the vinyl it is a thick record and it's a nice clear beautiful blue although that is a wonderful color that merge gave this gave this record that's really cool and I just like how the color scheme of the record sort of just matches up you know really well with the orange and her clothing here and the blue of the record sort of matches her clothing as well it's a nice sort of a planned out color scheme for the vinyl packaging and I don't know if I got this because I ordered it early or something but it sort of came with this is print that's oh that's very nice looks like a poster print or something like that the shout out to Bibby a sound machine because this is one of the funnest funkiest and most vibrant records that I've heard this year and sounds amazing on vinyl another one of my favourite albums of the year shout-out to mr. father John misty pure comedy had to get this thing had to have it this is one of the best vinyl packages I have seen this year if you love this album I highly highly highly recommend getting the deluxe version and I'm pretty sure that there are probably still some copies in circulation like this is fantastic not only are you sort of getting this nice plastic sleeve I think up a couple copies a couple of which I think I'm going to do a giveaway with so you have a nice you know wonderful plastic sleeve that sort of encapsulate s' the whole thing and then this is a sleeve as well this cool awesome mural on the front and back and then these records sort of slide out of the sleeve itself and apparently with each copy of the deluxe version there is an awesome holographic card here which is actually really amazing edition let me kind of like zoom that in for you so you can kind of see what's going on there so yes it's a holographic card it's like a tarot card it says despaired it's a depiction of a skeleton blowing leaves with a leaf blower and this is apparently one of several different holographic cards that you could get and there's like a whole deck of these that you can get off of father John misty zum website as well like these tarot cards that sort of depict elements of this huge amazing gigantic mural on the album cover and the whole double-lp thing over here you know you kind of have different elements of sort of like night day rainbow different sort of colors on each side of the of the you know vinyl sleeve which is really nice and the records themselves are different colors like you sort of have this milky sort of white clear with a you know sort of white splatters sort of thrown in there and then on the other one it's sort of like an orange goldish with some with some like darker orange splatters which is kind of like a nice beautiful touch and yeah you know the record art kind of looks different depending on which you know sort of album sleeve you have kind of poking out of it it's like a really immaculate amazing package the card the different sleeves the lyric sheet the additional album art over here on the other side of the lyric sheet like it's really cool and I really love the imagery of you know this crazy sort of chaotic you know really kind of apocalyptic and amazing mural like it totally matches up with the dark humor of the album itself and I think really kind of enhances the vibe and the personality of the album as well you know this is like an example of somebody really really really kind of going the extra mile going the extra distance with their album art you know I mean you know people say to me like hey this album art matter you know and I think for the most part it's not the biggest deal but I think that's usually because people are typically putting in about the same amount of effort into most album covers you know like there's some album covers that are complete ass and obviously you know no effort went into it and there's some album covers you know and obviously you know they kind of ruin the experience or make you not want to try the record out and then there are some packages where clearly they're really trying and this is very much an example of that I would say but yeah loving the hell out of this this vinyl package and the record itself sounds immaculate and it also came with this 7-inch of real love and rejected generic pop song March 15 number 3 which actually I'd not on the record player yet so I've just actually been playing the LP itself it does seem like you know sort of a nice addition to the deluxe package though so again highly recommend it if you love this album this this deluxe package is great like there's so much to it you know between the album art and just the color of the vinyl and you know the holographic card there's so much about it alright this next handful of records comes from my boys over at earache records who when I did a previous vinyl update they were like hey man you talked about the full dynamic range records that we just came out with you know you want us to send you some more and I said sure and I also pre-ordered one too because they sounded so good so this next like bunch of them all comes from from that this is the one I pre-ordered of course second napalm death record over here from enslavement to obliteration and goddamn like the full dynamic range records that these guys are putting out sound heavy as like scum I've had like you know digital copies of scum CD copy of scum I always thought the album sounded a little bit like ass obviously which is part of the reason a lot of people are turned off by it but the the mix on this record is so Basie and it's so full it kind of balances out just how harsh some of the guitars and the really frantic drumming on this album are it just is a little more even and listenable in my opinion you know obviously with these full dynamic range records they are copying you know the record straight from the original tapes which is exactly what you want on vinyl you know records are great vinyl is great but the thing is a majority of newer records and newer vinyl you're just taking a digital single and throwing on to an analog medium which you know kind of defeats the purpose a little bit when you're talking about the original and the fullest fidelity that you can get on a record however when you're taking the original analog tapes and you're putting them onto the record that's from analog to analog that's exactly what you want that's exactly what you're getting with these full dynamic range records and you know these records sound heavy they sound nasty as hell the recording sound really live and in the moment they sound like a document of an occurrence of it happening they don't sound like a studio product they're really nasty they're really grimy super aggressive at least the Napalm death record that's also the case for you know bowl thrower over here this album is so goddamn heavy which I'm sure is kind of enhanced a little bit you know just by the fact that it's on vinyl but realm of chaos man like this this this record came out in 1989 this death metal album it's a really great death metal album but 1989 how did they get this so heavy this album is so goddamn heavy it's so full it's so gargantuan it's so crushing I just love how brutal and sick the band sound is on this thing sort of go back to the napalm death just for a second you know it's pretty standard sleeve over here with a lyric sheet picture the band on the back thanks seems like they've stayed pretty true to the original printing of the albums as they could you know the records are black decent sort of pressing on albums not too thin not super thick either you know not like I guess inconveniently thick then you know just a decent decent sort of thickness but again the bolt over is so heavy it's so gargantuan I just love the way that they treated the way this album sounded liking the lyric sheet on here as well with some of the sort of original depictions of the robots that sort of are depicted on the front which if you sort of look up the history and the story behind them it's pretty interesting sort of where they got the whole concept for the album are and sort of where all that came from also they passed me a copy of Davey more of an angel album which you know as I said my death metal starter pack you know obviously there are very aggressive very grimy very grim and brutal death knell at death metal elements to this album but obviously the thrash sort of influence is huge on this album you know it is very much a good debt metal starter album for people who are kind of trying to dip their toes into the genre because it'll sound like things you're familiar with in the metal world already it is a very fast intense and amazing album and listening back to it like there are some I don't know elements of what sounds like some crazy warped and like very high-pitched nutty guitar sounds that I'm like sort of sitting here crazed as you know saying how like how hell'd they do that because there's like some crazy on this album as far as like sound play that you typically don't hear on like a lot of death metal albums badass picture of the band right there look at sick look at badass look and mean-looking looking a cult as pretty straight forward as far as the album cover over here I love this picture of what salads it's like this skeleton do like playing flu on a bone very nasty grim lyrics sheet right there nice pressing on the record itself standard black sort of color although more black more of an angel record I think it's kind of significant you know it's almost like it's it's kind of like it's not just a black record like any other black record it's black like your soul because some morbid angel album and also carcasses heart work really great record love just how melodic but yet brutal this album is you know really good quality death metal over here and I'm gonna truly just really listenable too I mean you know the clean sound and sort of a more pristine sort of production on this album I think will not scare off some people who may not be into a Cannibal Corpse or you know a napalm death you know second album or like an autopsy record or something like that you know some of the guitar melodies some of the heavy metal influences on this thing are really bright really fun make the album oddly kind of catchy obviously really grim sort of an album cover right there and apparently the album sculpture that is depicted on the front is Gieger I didn't even know that that was the case there's so many out there's so many musicians who are like sort of greatly influenced by his work and sort of featured his work on their stuff but yeah all you know all that earache full dynamic range like I highly recommend it it sounds great it sounds full it's so crisp you really get like the full sonic experience of the album I'm just really impressed with sort of the sound of these records and again just how they came out it just came out really good moving on from there got to give a shout-out to my dude Phil elrom I picked this up as soon as I saw it was announced that you can get it on vinyl and yeah it's a pretty impressive package it's actually kind of heartbreaking knowing what this album is about and looking at this photo of him clutching his child on the back obviously it's a very dark it's a very dreary album I mean that is sort of be expected the record itself when I listened when I listened to a digitally sounded very intimate sounded very much in the moment I would say that sound is enhanced even more listening to on record pretty standard pressing over here you know black record white sleeve there's a little bit of a sort of an insert over here as well with some words from Phil not only on the inner sleeve of the sort of gatefold over here but on the album itself which I will not spoil for you that kind of explain you know where he was coming from with the record you know sir what was happening around that time what inspired him you know sort of make the album musically and sort of contextually obviously what the album is about is very clear but you know he mentions a couple different things including you know son kills moon Benjy is kind of a you know reference point that kind of got him back on the horse of wanting to write and record you know in general not just sort of about this experience I mean it's a very powerful listen it's very powerful album it's it's still a soul-crushing record but I have to say that you know with more lessons it does kind of I guess kind of the trauma and the shock of what the album is about and just kind of what Phil describes I guess the beauty of the music and his compositions kind of reveal themselves a little bit more you know I think initially kind of the impact of what the album is kind of really hits you you know and kind of distracts from what's so good about the album musically and I feel like the more I listen to it the more that kind of comes across a full more a couple more a couple more shout out to the good people over violently please who I'm you know a member over there so they sent me a copy of guerrillas demon days when they did a thing for that and it's a really immaculate full like pristine sounding pressing this album sounds amazing got a nice gatefold over here that actually kind of depicts like almost like single art for every single track on the album we have some credits over here you know pictures of each member of the group as they are shown on the front sort of big and fat on the record sleeves and it's a nice sort of deep somewhat clear you know life sort of shines through a nice deep red record which is very nice oh and actually it's kind of like a alternative photos of the band members sort of like smiling and looking very villainous on the labeling of the record itself which is actually pretty nice but yeah really impressed with the record pressing and really impressed with the album art but the the vinyl itself sounds immaculate sounds amazing if you love this record god it sounds so good on vinyl it sounds so crisp it sounds so clean it sounds so full yeah I'm just really just generally impressed with the sound of this thing now I'm going to try to fit it back into the sleeve which I'm going to have a hard time with because the wrong part of what I feel like is the flap on the sleeve is sticky I feel like the sleeve itself the sleeve itself here should be what sticky not the flap because if the flap is sticky and the record sticks on the flap and that's not the case with this one but sometimes the flap is so sticky the glue is so sticky the minute it touches the frickin record for the record it rips the album cover and it makes me want to die uh and also shout-out to vitami please because they hooked me up with this goddamn Fiona Apple record this is the first time this is on vinyl this has never been on vinyl before Fiona Apple title never been on freakin vinyl before and it sounds great god it's so full it's so amazing I mean I'm mostly interacted with this album on cassette and on the radio because that's what it was popular that's that's what people are listening on when I was a kid so I've never heard it on record and I've never owned a CD copy of it either but listening to it here just sounds amazing it sounds full it's kind of just taking me down a trip down memory lane to be completely honest love the gatefold the record is pretty much just a standard but very thick black pressing it's very nice just sounds great and there's a very big sort of booklet and lyric sheet that came with the album with all these you know very moody intimate pictures of Fiona which again it's I'm really impressed with the package I don't know if this is still available but on a no man just really impressed all around with with what vinyl me please did with this and what the label did with this it's really amazing that this is on vinyl and it's really amazing that it sounds so great on record but honestly I'm not not surprised and um you know again for somebody who sort of grew up with this album being relevant and having these songs on the radio and my mom loving this album because I'm pretty sure she had a cassette - you know and we would enjoy these songs we enjoyed a lot of Fiona Apple music you know there were a lot of big female singer-songwriters that back in the day Sheryl Crow Alanis Morissette Jule Fiona Apple Tori Amos was doing her thing too you know that my mom was like a really big fan of and I grew up with a lot of that stuff I grew up listening to a lot of those singer songwriters and you know again this is really a trip down memory lane for me I've got to give a shout out to the good people over at King gizzard and the lizard wizard flying microtonal banana wonderful fun little uh sort of pressing over here banana yellow pressing very nice fun color fun cool color scheme I love kind of the matte finish of the sort of sleeve over here lyric sheet you know liner notes and all that sort of stuff and again I just love the color scheme of this thing and again I'm sort of looking at the album art over here and it says volume one of sort of these adventures and microtonal tuning and I don't know if they're actually going to come back to this you know I could imagine that they could come out with another record of the stuff hopefully I hopefully they will push further down this road and experiment a little bit more so it's a bit stranger and a bit more adventurous you know not just simply rehash what they did here but um you know I'm hoping they kind of revisit this sound because this is one of the coolest records I think the band has ever done really like in the again the color scheme looks wonderful looks fun it looks beautiful in the in the album not rather the the camera sort of video viewer and it sounds great too and finally the last thing I wanted to mention and looking at this okay there was like a little bit of glue on here is a little bit of gook as' a little bit of goodness on this thing I don't know where the heck this gook is coming from it's coming right off and some of you are probably like cringing looking at me sort of try to wipe it off over here but I have no idea where this gook is came from this little bit of gook Ahsan this and maybe I shouldn't be considering that I picked this up and it was somewhat expensive but I picked up the Bob's Burgers musical album this is basically all the music from the show I love Bob Bob's Burgers I think it's a great whole area show Tina is my spirit animal I don't know there's so much funny banter and jokes on the show I love the animation I love the humour style you know I love John Benjamin you know I think it's a great you know a voice actor you know pretty much every animation he's ever been involved in I am at least somewhat of a fan of and this is probably one of my favorite that he's ever been involved with so I just kind of needed to pick this up because I am a big fan of the show and you know this to me means a little bit more than just simply buying like you know a season of the show or something like that and this and the package here is immaculate it's fun it's crazy it's like totally insane and off-the-wall like just to kind of get into just the cover I mean it's super thick and there's like this awesome sort of imagery of every single sort of character on the show sort of thrown on to the side and then going into there the one-eyed snakes fans of the show will know what the hell this is from this is a literal patch this is a literal batch there's a sticker pack like tons of stickers from the show a cool little insert that does thank yous and you know sort of explains you know like a little bit of everything about a lot of the songs and obviously you know you're seeing every sort of person from the show here Bob's Burgers musical album this is like the first thing that hits you once you open it and then from there the first thing that a you know piece of media or whatever is the actual vinyl itself which is a nice sort of big triple LP this sort of like the white 7-inch with um Stephen Merritt the song electric love seat visits Bad Girls the National a couple of national songs that were on the that were on the show man this is crazy nice sort of you know triple gatefold thing depicting the whole Bob's Burgers neighbourhood each record itself is a different color you have like a ketchup red record you have a green one you have like a yellowish one my sort of opaque vinyl with sort of a sub pop in the 20th Century Fox logo on the labeling as well yeah I mean I actually have not played the vinyl because I've just been playing the digital like honestly I did not put anything on the turntable from this package because I've just been in my carrying the package itself like beyond that the sheet music sampler there's literally piano and ukelele sheet music from the show on this thing lifting up the skirt of the night this is working derek dematopolis work hard or die trying girl I love that episode um happy crappy place the spirits of Christmas bad stuff happens in the it's a pretty fun song so yes literal sheet music ukulele and piano from the show and then there's a series of posters that they hit you with like a handful of different posters from the show that I mean unfortunately they had to fold them you know but I'm going to play and they're gigantic posters there's four of these gigantic posters on the show that will looks like different kind of like creativity points of like the art and the sort of animation because you know Bob's Burgers just like the Simpsons they've kind of evolved into the look that they have right now you know there's kind of like a slicker like 90s looking version of the of the show poster over here that has more of like a shinier finish here's another sort of depiction of all the characters in the show on a poster but it's sort of like the original sort of like depictions of the characters with like you know different like facial sort of uh makeups and all that sort of stuff and then there is finally the hardcover lyrical book from the album which is another amazing piece of just like you know this thing ding ding ding bucks bucks bucks theme from banjo you got beef sasquatch this is working Van Leer so that if he bitsy stripper sex xx I want to hear your secrets like this is awesome like as somebody who is a fan of the show this is just like so amazing and just kind of like goes to show and goes a tribute just how much there is to the show you know not only the humor but also the musical element and just kind of the fact that each character has their own kind of unique interesting personality you know it's definitely one of my favorite animated shows ever you know not just one of my favorite animated shows on TV right now but uh definitely one of my favorite animated shows ever and I was really happy to be able to pick this up because you know it does sort of celebrate and you know sort of highlight exactly what I think kind of makes the show so special and unique so yeah you know that's that's going to pretty much just go into my collection and you know and all uh you know sort of observe it and admire it everyone's in Ohio because this is this is just one of the few moments where I allow myself in my in my record collection to have something that I just have it merely to collected you know I mean pretty much everything I have in my collection I actually play you know when I actually use like you know a record but again this is one of the few moments I've sort of allowed myself to be like okay this is meh this is me being a collector this is my collector thing is my collector thing that I'm collecting and I'm just collecting it and that's it just because I want it but yeah that's it for this final update thank you very much for watching hope you guys got some good recommendations on stuff in here and see my shirt being ridiculous and clinging to me and yeah that's it I'll see you guys in the next one forever

1fvl1Yigl9A,everyone Yaya 10mm here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ski mask the slump of God album you will regret it's really more of I guess a mixtape the the ski mask the slump god is a florida rapper who's been making some noise online with some small-time hits some features with his boy XXX 10th asean he's got a few eps out as well and i don't know how he swung it but while his buddy ex was getting all this promotion on the double XL freshman cover here we have ski mask getting this little thing over here released on Republic Records he is out here open didn't have to sell a soul to get this thing out but I respect his hustle and I've been slowly kind of coming around on this thing at first I just kind of assumed it wasn't gonna be for me nothing of interest here just another kind of ad-lib eat rap rapper with not a lot of lyrical substance and maybe on the surface it does kind of seem like that I mean there are a lot of trendy instrumentals on this thing there are a lot of ad-libs there's a lot of very druggie sexual materialistic and violent lyrical content those ski mask does occasionally come through with some very quirky and strange wordplay but I don't know man there is just something about mr. slump God and it's not that he's actually a very talented rapper I mean some of the flows that he whips out on this thing are really fast dizzying intense and fun I mean he can be really precise when he wants to be and he's not just this emotionless slack-jawed moron either even on the low key cuts on this thing his delivery his performances are really expressive and animated and pretty off-the-wall I mean some of his vocal inflections on this thing don't even sound like he's in control of his own voice Tony McCallum honey money Kanekalon mama honey that's kind of like my weird tame impersonation of it like on record it sounds even weirder and some of the lyrical references he brings on this thing are really obscure they're nerdy they're strange a lot of very dark humor a lot of cartoon references a lot of horror movie iconography on the song Adventure Time he makes at least a couple references to Chuckie Cheese and there are a handful of earworm refrains on this thing that I just cannot deny and there's some really gross and just really unexpected similes on this thing to like where he's talking about his pockets being so fat that they have allergies or like they have cancer my bitch she hot my bitch she hot my bitch she hot my bitch she hot just like a stove just like my piss when it smell old I'm whippin a bowl hot like your piss okay all right all right I will say his style is kind of gimmicky and there's not too much to some of these songs that are mostly these very quick aggressive Mimi hits of vocal wildness that just kind of dipped before the two-minute mark and there is an interlude track on this thing that just sounds like a Travis Scott ripoff however though I do think with ski mask the slump God is doing on this project is kind of part of the course for what I talked about in that little yachty wraps Punk phase video because while I do come away from this thing leaving a little unsatisfied like there could have been a bit more to this thing I do think ski mask is bringing kind of a newer wild style I think he's kind of breaking down the fundamentals of the genre his music is kind of crazy and energized and visceral and takes a sort of rudimentary approach there's some true highlights on this thing in my opinion of the song that I referenced earlier just like my piss loved the eerie lead melody on the beat in this thing the insane rapid-fire flow that slump God brings throughout this thing the very slow and heavy bird is the word is almost like mutant in the way the slump got wraps on this thing I know the bird bird bird the word obviously a drug reference but the refrain itself is a reference to the trashman's song surfin bird' which is something I would never think I'd hear mentioned so overtly in a contemporary rap song but here we are and again just the tone of the really odd drawn-out weird vocals on this thing it's borderline disturbing and unsettling and the song baby wipe what is it with all these weird underground soundcloud Florida rappers right now like busting out these really fast funny very catchy flows they're a lot of weird overdubs specifically on this track it almost kind of hits a bit of a Mego survive at point I feel like I'm listening to like two or three different slump gods all at once on the same track all kind of going crazy it has a really disorienting and kind of overwhelming effect that I like a lot and the very high-energy h2o that ends the project off is a highlight for me too while I'm not really a huge fan of X at this point in time I can't deny that these two have a lot of chemistry together the rumbling bass and the very punchy beat on this cut helped a lot too I wish the song Rambo was a bit longer I feel like it's a good intro to the album and displays exactly what makes slump gods so appealing or so unappealing depending on what your opinion of this guy is because I don't think he's for everybody know the song energy is a bit of a snoozer there are bits of this song that I like but there are a lot of spots where there just isn't much vocal presence from slump God and it really could have used a little bit more of I don't know everything and the song ever took a tab in my opinion just doesn't add that much to this project that is already so short to begin with it's just 25 minutes or so and given that length it really should have been all killer and no filler on this thing and hopefully into the future I'm just crossing my fingers and hoping for more material longer more fully fleshed out songs wilder production more structure more experimentation getting a little bit more adventurous with the lyrics but as of right now I think slump god has a lot to offer with these really crazy wacky land raps that he's doing and while it is very much an obviously flawed project I think that I don't know there's just a lot to look forward to hopefully as long as slump God continues to progress and evolve and grow and build upon what he's done here I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this thing transition have you given this slump God project to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next it's like like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave it angry come in the

2HU9fnoqGtY,hi everyone like I said and Goten here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the somewhat new new album from black lips satan's graffiti or God's art Atlanta flower Punk's the black lips are back with a brand new album their first in like three or four years their last record was underneath the rainbow in 2013 and I was pretty excited to listen to this album because oddly enough I I consider myself like like a fan of this band for whatever reason this band's wild sweaty punky post hippie takes on the sounds of garage rock and country music really targets an itch that few bands scratch however looking back I've been an absolutely awful fan of this band and have not been very supportive of their work I mean I own and have owned a lot of their stuff but like I don't know you you wouldn't think I enjoy this band looking at my review catalogue I mean my 2009 review of 200 million thousand got deleted because I deleted a lot of my back catalogue because it had like song clips in it their follow up Arabia mountain produced by Mark Ronson I just wasn't really sure what to make of the slightly cleaner sound the band was delivering at the time and it really took me a while to come around to that album which I eventually did and when I did it was really just kind of too late to make any significant comment about the record and their last album while it's easily one of their worst I feel like I could have done better about giving that album the time of day because after revisiting it to sort of prepare for this new review over here there definitely were more song as I stood out on it now than there were when I initially interacted with it and now I'm incredibly late to say anything about this new record over here and basically I suck I'm an idiot I'm a piece of however all of that being said though I did at one point in time give a copy of Arabia mountain to Mick Jagger and I would like to believe that all of my sins committed here have been atoned for with that action anyway I'm not going to lie I am somewhat impressed with what the Black Lips are trying to do on this new album this is one of the longest albums the band has ever put out if not the longest it's just under an hour and on this thing the group essentially tries to take their very grimy sound and turn it into something grand the production still sounds distorted and kind of ugly and covered in muck it smells like it could use a shower too but the band seems to be adding more horns and keys and just more instrumental dynamics all around just to kind of give the record a bit more body and then there's the flow of the record which the band punctuates with these interlude tracks and they bookend it too with an overture and a finale and it seems like overall there's kind of a greater sense of how the songs are flowing into each other how the first leg of the record sounds distinctly different than the last leg of the record the song occidental front kicks the album off really well it's like turning the key in a muscle car and instantly going from 0 to 60 a lot of the tracks on the first half of the record are unruly and visceral and nutty which are contrasted very nicely by come ride with me and in my mind there's a dream and lucid nightmare which have a very grim creepy tone to them and even though you do have kind of different musical and emotional vibes throughout the record the entirety of it kind of has this you know weird backwoods sort of backwater vibe to it that kind of maintains throughout it's very Ruthie and rusty and dirty and raw you know so there are a lot of highlights along this very long tracklist however I feel like the devil is in the details of this record because I really do question whether or not this intro this outro these interlude cuts do they really add anything to the album other than just filler other than just to simply just pad out the runtime I mean not really you know the song got me all alone has a very gruff and drunk and lowdown dirty biker band sort of feel to it but I feel like the band hits a moment of tediousness on the song as they're just kind of jamming with no real direction or I guess a goal in sight it's like I'm listening to the Dead Milkmen try to create a parody song for a band that would play the CD bar in Twin Peaks or I don't know like a cramps impression gone wrong though certainly this track is better than bongos baby or electric spider webs which seem even more pointless in addition to this there are at least a few legitimately written tracks that actually could have been cut from this sort of flabby album like the song Wain which has one of the worst and most basic melodies on the entire record gets so old so fast and even though this track has just maybe a stronger narrative voice coming out of the lyrics it doesn't make up for the fact that it's just a lackluster song and on the song the last cul-de-sac I mean I am kind of torn on the song I do like the themes of suburban rot going on in the lyrics but I feel like the chord progression here is just an old folk rock cliche and the band is I don't know just kind of playing it a little mild here like maybe the song could have been a bit more exciting if they put more umph on it more stank on it more guts in it but they really just kind of decided to lay back and just play it sort of safe and the song we know is a track that sits kind of nondescript Lee in the Black Lips Canon like there are so many tracks previously in their back catalogue that sound very similar to this track in music in production in vocal performance after listening to it again and again and again I couldn't think of a single thing that to me made it stand out or seem even a little special in the grander scheme of the Black Lips discography still though there are more highlights that I could list off of the very dark and dreary can't hold on also the very catchy passionate and potentially controversial crystal Knight which at first sounds like a kind of loose satirical piece of doo-wop something Frank Zappa would have done back in the day sort of like a Frank the Cavaliers last kiss or something like that but instead of losing your best girl in the car crash the protagonist sings about losing his loved one in the Holocaust crystal nacht you know there's obviously like a bit of social awareness to this song but there's a note of very dark humor as well the song squatting in evan is one of those black lips tracks that finds beauty and a really chaotic and noisy performance and the song that won't be long is a very short but menacing banger about seduction you know overall it's a decent album I appreciate again what the band was trying to do with this thing write a record that is very long and feels big and feels grand but I feel like musically and sonically they didn't experiment enough to make this record feel as fresh as it possibly could have and a lot of what they did to pad the album out and make it feel like a grander experience was just sort of throwing filler into the tracklist there is a very good like 12 track album in the tracklist here a good 10 to 12 track album in this thing but it's just kind of a in the rough still though I continue to love the band's sound their style their snotty brash demeanour and I'm looking forward to what they do next and just crossing my fingers hoping that there's less fluff in Black Lips future I'm feeling a strong six to the lightest of sevens on this thing transition have you given this Black Lips album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it are the best or the best which whatever your next hit like if you like please subscribe please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're angry over here next to my head you can check out my review of the new Lana Del Rey album also produced by Sean Ono Lennon who produced this Black Lips album over here did some production on this record and yeah shout out to to him cool alright forever 
r3OLn4vaBzw,hi everyone what a nature Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new booty tape from ugly god ugly god is a texas-based rapper and a 20-17 double XL freshman who's been turning a lot of heads over the past year or so with some pretty big internet hits most notably the very viral water a splash on you bitch worth of water especially in your bitch leg water especially inhibition of the water water water Lauda wada this guy is a lot of push he has a lot of hype he has a lot of attention however all that attention is sort of centered around this handful of songs that have done pretty well online he up until this point has not had a sizable album or mixtape to speak of until now wit da booty tape now from the material I've heard from this guy so far I think ugly God has potential he's kind of eccentric as a sense of humor he approaches song topics and kind of a weird quirky left-field way sometimes he drops a lot of crazy self-deprecating bars and he's not just simply one of these completely flow lists and rhythm deficient mumble rappers most of the time and that's the thing ugly God is kind of inconsistent not every single he's been dropping over the past year or so has been heat and also case in point just look at the vast difference in quality between his double XL freestyle and his double XL cypher performance which sounded like a test he didn't study for so I don't know I just went into this new tape hopeful hoping that ugly God would either figure out a way to transcend his meme status in the rap realm or actually prove that he is the clown that hip-hop needs right now and honestly the booty tape doesn't either I mean this thing is 10 mostly mediocre tracks the best of which we've actually heard already I mean water is on this thing and being excited to hear water at the very end of the booty tape is like being excited to hear hotline bling at the end of views I mean not only that but the song as days are numbered I mean it's a viral hit it's a big song but I mean half of the lyrical references on this thing are going to be irrelevant or nearly irrelevant in the next two two three years it's a fun song but its shelf life is obviously going to be short though I do like the recently released track fuck ugly God on this thing it's this amazing embarrassing diss track to himself I've never heard such a thing before it's really revealing and funny and clever but you know leave it to a guy named ugly God to make that sort of thing happen sadly the rest of the tape isn't really graced with the same stroke of unforeseen genius none of the song topics on this thing are nearly as interesting with maybe the exception of the very demeaning and very mean-spirited stop smokin Black & Mild which is almost too mean of a song every single bar on this thing is meant to just mercilessly put down this girl for being trashy as if God is one to talk but another issue I have with the track is that it's one of many cuts on this thing that runs really short feels pretty under written kind of attention decision it's like almost each song on this thing is based off of a joke that gets really not funny really fast kind of like a vine that goes on too long for example the song LBC which stands for little dick click ugly til I die I ripped that little dick clip which i think is a hilarious chorus I think is a hilarious song idea which almost has infinite possibilities well you know maybe not infinite possibilities but certainly more possibilities than what ugly God actually presented here you really could have thrown any course on this track assembled them with these verses and you would have nearly the same results the supposed concept is gold ugly God just doesn't do anything with it for the most part I mean this thing is kind of just generic filler trap the beats are kind of Spacey they're kind of pretty a lot of ugly gods flows are very average and run-of-the-mill sometimes he drops a very lewd or very nasty or a very kind of silly bar here and there but it's all just kind of loose change it doesn't add up too much and even when it does putting it out there's about as embarrassing as just taking to fat pocketful of quarters and slamming them down on the counter at the convenience sort of pay for some shit there's just a lot of material on this thing we're ugly God comes off really average or just straight boring I'm a nasty ho like a maverick the song bitch as well and ugly god and Wiz Khalifa is one of the most awkward and unnecessary rap pairings I've heard this year on the whole there's nothing really all that great or exciting about this tape to be completely honest it just kind of sounds like ugly God didn't put in the amount of effort required to really build up a satisfying 10 track project he just patted it out with these forgettable songs which are more miss than they are hit and that's kind of it you know I think maybe going forward ugly guys should just continue to focus on just putting together strong singles because any internet age in the age of streaming in the age of viral music videos on YouTube I think there is a lane for a more singles based rap artists I mean singles are exactly how ugly guys got to this point in the first place so why fix what's not broken I guess and sure at some point in the future I would be interested to hear an album or a tape or whatever from ugly god but only if he puts the same amount of effort into each song rather than just packing the tracklist out with filler I'm feeling a strong four to a life five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best but your

7Aqu9Mo42XQ,hi everyone thousand a mouse hello here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Oxbow album the thin black Duke this is the latest full-length LP from California art rock noise rock experimental rock outfit Oxbow who have not put out a full-length album in like ten years though they did drop an EP in 2009 on Hydra head records which sounds a little bit more in line with what they're doing stylistically on this album than their actual last full length record but I will get into that later for all intents and purposes it's been like 10 years and this is pretty much their comeback album a comeback album we haven't heard one of those in 2017 not to be cynical but there have been a lot of groups who peaked creatively in the mid 90s early 2000s that have been the dropping records out of the blue lately however as far as experimental rock goes Oxbow is an underground underappreciated great I would not hesitate for a second to recommend to you guys narcotics story or serenade in red or an evil Heat after you watch this video however their latest record over here shows the band returning with a refreshing new sound and direction which is not a bad thing you know there's really nothing sadder than seeing a band return after 10 or 20 years only to try to do the same thing that they used to do and fail miserably at it because just the energy the passion whatever was there originally is just not there now and you know if any underground band can totally get away with doing something completely different after disappearing off the map a little bit it's Oxbow so rather than delivering unpredictable and animalistic and wild experimental and noise rock this time around the band presents us with something much moodier and more refined kind of orchestral to with the band backing up a lot of the angular and dreary guitar and bass and drum parts on this thing with some very lavish strings and horns and pianos it gives what would have otherwise been a very straightforward art rock record some very much needed dynamics the mix is generally pretty bassy to it has a nice round Rumble to it I'm not saying it's as heavy as a doom record or anything like that but when the band really hits you with all of their instrumental guns and they're giving you that full frequency of the guitars the bass the vocals the drums and the strings it just feels so full and so invigorating especially as they're building up to a point of high instrumental intensity like toward the finish of letter of note now I'm not going to lie this is not a very catchy album there is something kind of ambiguous about it something kind of shadowy and deceptive about it like it does everything it can without making it obvious to sort of make it difficult for me and for pretty much any listener to kind of wrap their head around it and enjoy it in the same way that you would pretty much any other rock record like for one the album isn't very visceral in my opinion it's not a very throttling rock album though there are some very heavy and aggressive parts here and there of what I think kind of ways that down and not in a bad way actually in a very effective way in a very artistic way I think kind of ways that down is just this overwhelming sense of tragedy that permeates almost every spot on the record and I think it's that tragedy and it's that da genus that kind of made it hard for me to review this album because it has been a while since this thing came out but I've been listening to it on and off for weeks and weeks and weeks and while I have been enjoying it I've been kind of stumped on how exactly to explain to you guys what makes this album tick and what makes it appealing to me I mean for one after multiple listens there are some pretty significant and sticky melodies that work their way into multiple tracks here like the very dreary piano and string melodies on a che homo or the very grand and swing-out row on the song host which features these hard heavy syncopated guitar and piano chords bum bum bum like it's really big and the song the upper featured these really powerful Dorjee piano melodies in three four over much of the track but as good as the instrumentation on this album is a lot of the time it's frontman Eugene Robinson that's stealing the show still after all these years his vocal abilities have not really waned all that much or at least it doesn't show on this album he still comes off as kind of like a vocal shape-shifter performing schizophrenic on pretty much every track here delivering different vocal styles and sounds and emotional expressions like they're really shouty and over-the-top singing on cold and well-lit place which eventually is contrasted in the song with some monstrous growls or the heart-wrenching and crack vocals on a che homo which are alternated eventually with kind of these deep dark whispers or the really intense and manic muttering that kicks off a gentleman's gentleman that eventually gives way to this like very gruff sort of barking Vogel that delivers this really kind of creepy character portrait the strange shouts over much of the finished line are unsettling to say the least the song the upper features these really cold weird narrations while host has one of the most wild and twisted vocal performances on the entire album Eugene just showcases an incredible amount of versatility all over this thing he's unpredictable he's on Orthodox it's strange it's really difficult to define and pin down exactly what he's doing some of the time and that's kind of just the album in general even though a lot of what I'm hearing here doesn't sound completely alien to me or anything like that but trying my best to decipher this record has been a kind of weird process I guess maybe I would have hoped for maybe a more logical flow to the songs or maybe some of the lyrics on here but maybe the fact that interpreting this stuff was kind of a weird experiences exactly why this album left such an odd impression on me one that I can't quite shake and leads me to feel that this is easily one of the more outlandish rock records I've heard this decade and maybe one of the harder ones to measure - I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this thing transition have you given this Oxbow album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it here the best you're the best which in our view next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comma in the comments if you're angry and yeah that's it

shirt will no longer be in rotation so if you want this shirt get it now while supplies last well it's not even really a supply thing it's more of a time cutoff sort of thing so the link to grab the shirt is down there in the description and let's get into the worst tracks of the leaked Hey alright let's kick it off a oh this new Ke$ha song him unfortunately this is not really living up to the hype and the excitement that I had initially when I heard the first single from this album which is a really huge powerful personal ballot for Kesha a really dynamic track showed I think just sort of a level of I guess emotional capacity that I didn't think was capable in her music before but now it just sounds like she's writing generic top 40 pop tap and that's it really the most unimpressive single out of all of them that I've heard so far not the worst one but the most generic and forgettable of all of them and my boy Jake Paul over here has a brand new track out titled a YouTube star dis YouTube star dis woo you know our everyday bro over here a new track and I click on it because I'm thinking hey you know it'll probably be dumb it'll probably be cringy it'll probably be stupid but I'll have fun watching it you know and I'll know that he had fun doing it or something but I click on it and it's not this hard in your face funny sort of stupid YouTube star disc it's this dumb track where he's like you don't understand me everybody's picking on me I've done is I did nice things for the world okay I do nice things for people that's not on your Instagram there's not on your Twitter food whiz dad was other nice stuff I'm a book person and I'm nice why are you so mean to me that big and I mean listen we we all appreciate that you may in fact be a nice person that's totally fine but you make crappy music and that's why everybody's kind of crapping on you and and that's all you're just a really corny dude who can't rap and you make crappy music and that's the reason people are just shitting on you you know it's nothing personal it's nothing against you as a person nobody really knows anything about you as a person there are probably some you know really nasty trolls on the internet that has sort of been coming at you as a result of this song and I get that and I'm sorry if that's the case you know but as far as other people you know other youtubers news organizations commenting on what you're doing I mean they're doing it because you're essentially a meme now and your music sucks including this song so I don't know I just wish you did like a fun funny disc you know and just kind of responded to you know the fact that people are just kind of having fun with what you're doing in kind you know I think you're just kind of taking a little too seriously like everybody just kind of picking on it because it's just dumb and stupid and bad you know and that's all has nothing to do with whether or not you're a nice person and even if you are a nice person it doesn't make your music suck any less you know your music is still shit so I don't know what else to say to you dude like you know I'm assuming that this song is coming from a real place and this one's bad too so if people pick on you for this one again it has nothing to do with whether or not you're good or bad your music just stinks and let's get into the tracks that it was just kind of meh you know I I didn't actively search for anything that I really disliked this week just some things that sort of test by my you know ears there so the worst track segment is kind of short this time but the tracks that I thought were just okay wasn't crazy about them was still worth recommending so we're talking about so worth mentioning so worth linking down there in the description let's go first this new track from zombie which is going to be released as part of this like small three-part release it's titled gasp I don't want to go in too much detail if I go into the process of describing this song too deeply I run the risk of zombie hopping on Twitter and calling me another fruit so um you know and everybody already calls me a melon so I don't want anybody else calling me I don't know banana or an apple or whatever fruit he's going to call me next but I will say that the groove on this is one of the nastiest and most fun I've ever heard on the zombie song so far just really funky just really bassy really nice atmosphere surrounding the beats on this track it does sort of reach a point of monotony toward the end but you know it seems like more of a more of a Club context for this song than it is just kind of like simply sitting down on headphones and over analyzing it or something like but it is very enjoyable B is very enjoyable production looking forward to seeing him kind of maybe grow in this direction because I didn't really care for his last record that much but I just definitely piqued my interest next guy but to get it a little bit excuse me can't talk right now weaves why to open the song off of this record is titled number 53 and it's a little bit of a 90s sort of indie rock throwback but there are some solid pieces of guitar work on here solid vocal melodies on this thing actually love the singing vocals on this thing the the singer on this thing has a lot of personality she's got a lot of grit you know but there's kind of a nice melodic sort of delivery to her singing on this thing it's not too rough not too wild just a really sweet catchy bit of a 90s throwback to sweet tune moving on from there the war on drugs another track from the project's forthcoming record a deeper understanding the song is titled pain and yet you know just kind of another breezy laid-back jangly atmospheric indie rock tune or with a kind of a folky somewhat folky twist to it just a little bit some of these new singles are very not really been hitting me all that hard I'm just kind of waiting to see if maybe in the context of the new record they really kind of grab my interest and hold my interest as an entire project because as a series of standalone tracks it's not really wow me thus far however I did really dig this new race sremmurd sort of one-off track perplexing pegasis which is a ridiculous song title but it is very fun tune you know not much of a hook on this thing but some of the lyrics are pretty fun and it's got a very catchy flow very eerie beautiful instrumental very chill laid-back sort of pop rap track with a trap twist it's not bad not one of my favourite race rumored singles but it does have a nice vibe to it and again the flow is very catchy and I got to give a shout out to this new mess track a drained Lake definitely seems like the band is kind of reverting back to their generic noise Rock selves and you know sort of post-hardcore cells on this track a little bit the riff writing on their last project I thought was a super rudimentary super boring very generic and I think they're kind of again falling into those ways again however I do have to give this track the fact that the band sort of worked in some crazy noises and effects over the guitars just kind of add like this wild sort of interesting texture to the song that you know is just sort of beyond you know the general guitar bass drum vocals set up you know so there is kind of some interesting sonic play at work here you know I'm not taking everything away from the track but again the guitar work I think has slipped a little bit into run-of-the-mill moving on from there Holograms of the post-punk band out of Europe that is kind of dark and they sound a bit like Ice Age they have a new track out which I didn't even know they have like a new album out titled surrender and this track over here that they put out in the drop two music video for it as well it is titled if I can not be an idiot shame and did it yeah it kind of seems like the band is going back to their roots a little bit or at least the roots of their debut record their sophomore record I think hit a little bit of a slump seemed like they kind of lost what made the band appealing in the first place however this new track over here it's a bit more stripped back it's more visceral it's more gritty it's more direct again I don't really think they're doing anything much better than they did on their debut record but this sort of gives me a little bit hope a little bit of hope that they're actually going to you know again kind of start from square one and try to build from there and hopefully something different or something a little bit more adventurous I hope they don't just do the same thing you know on another album as they did on their debut but again it sort of seems like they've hit that vein of viscera once more that sort of got me hooked into their music in the first place next this new higher brothers single that I got off of the 88 rising YouTube channel they've been dropping a lot of singles and they're kind of killing it with these singles you know like this is a good rap group from the far east and I don't know dude they got good production they got good flows the songs are catchy obviously there's a little bit of a language barrier but they do put subtitles on the videos not that you guys a lot of you really pay attention to fucking lyrics anyway you know just listen to the vibe of the track and the instrumental and the flows and you're going to like it because I think a lot of what makes so much contemporary hip-hop catchy over here these guys are doing it you know they're they're on the ball you know there's nothing really sort of about their style or about their sound or about their performances that is the least bit off you know I mean I'm not going to say it's like the best written song or best produced song I've ever heard you know but they're definitely up to the standards of what you would expect from a lot of popular rap of today in the West so you know they're doing it and they're killing there get a lot of views doing it too so shout out to higher brothers the song again it's a rather it's titled young master alright next I want to give a shout out to this new for ket song planet for Tet has sort of gone back to his roots a little bit and has delivered a track with you know kind of a driving hypnotic dance beat and some elements of like acoustic sounds sort of weaved into the instrumental as well that I think are very beautiful very refined very nice on the ear it's not one of my favourite Four Tet songs ever you know but it is kind of a nice bit of a change of pace to hear something that I expected you know from for Ted because he has been kind of in the weeds a little bit kind of experimenting with a bunch of different sounds and uploading their Bandcamp and sometimes they're you know a little hit or miss for me however this one really did grab my attention and you know again it's not one of my favorite Four Tet songs ever you know but it is a nice nice production and finally in this segment I want to shout out the new complete failure track I am begun now I believe this project is going to be coming out on seasons of mist which is you know very cool left feel that's our alternative underground metal label that don't typically put out the kind of stuff that this band makes essentially this song is like some really enraged wild noisy hardcore and middle core and metalcore you know not the kind of generic you know chug-chug-chug super breakdown centric hardcore you know something very furious and dark and you know almost blackened about what the band is doing on on this track while it is very much hardcore at at its base there is something very atmospheric and you know very dark and very ominous about it you know it's not just simply this kind of bro like you know spin kicks you know camo shorts that kind of shit you know there's something really dark and strange and sort of weird and that I can't quite put my finger on you know there's something murky and very cloudy and a grim about it you know that I think makes it up kind of interesting and I'm definitely going to be keeping the eye out for this forthcoming record because this song did grab my attention next let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best best best best best tracks that I heard all week the songs that excited me the most first off the new the world is a beautiful place and I am no longer rain denies song a Dylan and her son this is a new single out from the band which I believe has just undergone a bit of a personnel change and kind of a sound change to which for me is not all that surprising considering that I think they just signed up with epitaph so they're going to be releasing music with that label and you know they wouldn't be the first band with kind of a punk edge to sign up with epitaph or release an album on epitaph that you know cleaned up their sound a little bit got a little more direct and that's exactly what the song is this is like one of the sweetest and most straightforward songs the world is has ever recorded and released and it's actually not a bad sound for them in my opinion I actually think the song is very fun very catchy very energetic very captivating maybe not as dynamic and as dramatic as some of their slower more post-rock influenced stuff but I actually do like the direction the band took this song in and hopefully you know they kind of balance this track out with some tracks that are you know a little bit more you know again dynamic slower on the deeper cuts of the album because again this sort of epitaph records the kind of label that while they are you know holding the torch and carrying the torch rather for the punk ethos you know they do sort of put bands in the situation but they do have to come out with a strong single - promoter records so again I'm not all that surprised moving on from there open mike eagle has a new song out and a new record on the way this song over here is titled 95 radios it's you know not the strongest catchiest most hard-hitting single from open mic you're ever going to hear it's one of his slower more I guess introspective rap ballad type tunes but it's actually a very sweet melody that once I listen to it several times over it really stuck with me it's a really sweet endearing track again it may take a little bit to grow on you because it is very easygoing but it's a very sweet track and of course as always I am very excited to listen to another album from mr. open mic one easily one of the most creative rappers working today moving on from there lose dead which is the title of this new song from Lou the human who is sort of an up-and-coming rapper right now that I've been keeping tabs on because he does have kind of a very special sort of dark kind of vibe to him I like his lyrics to me this song is very very lyrical very I guess a kind of confessional very dark at points and while Lou I've always read sort of a bit of an mmm influence in his music this is probably easily his most mm inspired track thus far however you know that doesn't mean he's just rapping real fast over really mediocre beat or anything like that you know like he still got some creative production he still got a lot of swagger and charisma and they're still kind of that dark moody vibe that sort of drew me to his music in the first place but you know the lyrics are definitely like you know really grim very dark here and actually a very well written to a points I would say liars liars liars dropped two tracks this week titled coins in my cage fist and the grand delusional sort of on the opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of just energy level one of which you know has more of a subdued very despondent almost like as low-key as some of the material on wish you was and then the flipside of that you know has a be it's more straightforward I would say both of the tracks as a vibe is like you know just the sounds of the vocals the vibe of the instrumental the sound of the instrumental very good in first my first impressions is that there was a point toward the end of each track where they did hit a little bit of a lull however you know I will admit I didn't listen to these songs multiple times over like again and again and again and again because I don't want to spoil too much of the album for myself because I am very excited for this record however you know first impressions from just the mere sound of the tracks I was actually very impressed and still very excited to kind of hear this new album moving on from their Juicy J oh my god this new song over here flood watch with offset is fantastic they it's it's got kind of the straightforward trap beat to it very heavy bass very sharp snares the rattling high hats the whole deal but then there's this amazing piano chord progression on the track that is kind of glam inspired it almost sounds like you know parts of it could have made sense on David Bowie's life on Mars I don't know man just the piano part and this thing is amazing and you know juicy J's flows and his refrains on this track are very catchy very dark very violent very gritty offset does this thing - I think it's a really quality track and I don't know has me kind of excited to see what Juicy J is going to be doing in the near future because this this is a great song moving on from there got to give a shout-out to my dude hot dad who has a very wordy title new single over here titled um can you talk to people around the world on the internet it's a bit of a poppy synth pop new wave throwback where he is sort of literally singing about whether or not you could send people messages like via email over the internet it's a very funny sort of tongue-in-cheek very entertaining very catchy as usual song hot dad sort of continues to have this knack for writing songs that you know they sort of flirt with the idea of making comedy music and there's obviously a silly sort of weird comedic tone to them but they're legitimately catchy songs you know they're well produced songs and they're well structured with very solid hooks you know so it's sort of a comedy music that you could enjoy almost without even you know worrying yourself about what the comedic element of it is because again it's so catchy and moving on from there I want to give a shout out to this new Deerhoof song featuring a Leticia sader of you know obviously a stereolab Fame and I got to give a shout out to this song over here because uh come down and say come down here and say that it's this track over here where deer hoof kind of take that sweeter more I guess I don't know a more easygoing almost sleeker tone of the last track and I think they kind of bring back a little bit of the quirkiness a friend opportunity and gear nervous vocals and satyrs vocals actually do like pair very well on this track like it's actually a really good pairing it's a really good collaboration she actually brings a lot to the song and deer have survived and I don't know it's just kind of a really good collaboration it's a catchy song and deer hoofs usual sort of fun and quirk is there not so much the whole low-key thing that they dabbled on with that weird garage rock album that they dropped not too long ago I think they were you know just kind of doing something a little bit more generic and anonymous this sort of me this to me seems like deer have pushing forward doing something a little cleaner a little popular a little different but it's still very much a strong deer hoof sound I guess I'll say and nearing the end of this I'm getting kind of worn out here because I've talked about so many songs in this video I just gathered all these tracks I'm like I want to talk about all these tracks I've got to give a shout out to the new Brock Hampton single over here it's titled gummy and it's a banger it's great has me totally excited for the second project they're going to be dropping this freaking year saturation to the flows Kevin abstract brings on this track are incredible they're great and the beat has almost like kind of a wild West Coast vibe to it like a 90s West Coast sound to it that I think is really good and I'm just going to leave it at that I love it I think it's a great single the lastly I got to give got to give a shout-out to Benjamin Clementine for this new track over here titled god save the jungle and this is some of the most visceral music Benjamin Clementine has come out with to date I mean I really enjoyed his last record but there were elements of it that to me read as just SuperDuper refined almost a little too hoity-toity to kind of get exciting or kind of get the blood blood pumping and you know this to me sounds like he's writing more coherent more focused more direct songs that aren't so much you know kind of a I guess kind of have an air about them this over here just seems so you know just so concentrated so potent and I love that you know because Benjamin is an incredible piano player he is an incredible singer and it's electrifying to sort of hear him using those talents to create music that is just I guess a little bit more in the main jugular of you know sort of emotion you know and we're going to leave it at that those were the tracks from this week that I am recommending to you guys hope you check them all out or at least the ones a sort of piqued your interest here again that Amazon and turntable a blank hit it down there below shirts are available as well along with all the tracks I talked to this talked about in this video and you're the best I'll see you guys in the next one again hope you got some good recommendations out of this and love you love you love you run run run run run forever [Music] 
NkwrmYepMPs,welcome welcome welcome everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and if you're like me me me me me you're in your late 20s you're a total dork for music and occasionally a little nostalgic for your youth your teen years your tween years and as you may already know music is one of the most powerful tools when it comes to bringing back some of those emotions and vivid memories from the past there's actually a really cool article about it in philosophy today which you can find a link to somewhere and while there is a lot of music that came out during the mid and late 90s early 2000 that I am very fond of the songs I'm going to list in this video are of a different breed they are tracks I hated the moment they touched my eardrums or songs that make me wince a little bit at the idea of having liked them at one time either way they really make my blood curdle now here are the 10 worst songs of my adolescence thank you number 1 okay we are good on that we don't need that again number one very few tracks in the rat metal world capture that pure essence of melodrama as much as this one does Papa Roach's last resort the band's breakout single sounded pretty badass once it first hit the radio airwaves with that horrible iconic guitar Lee that would be practice to death in guitar shops across America for years to come and the track really stuck out against other popular metal tracks at the time for being a really gritty expression of suicidal thoughts but in retrospect the badass hardcore rap vocal delivery didn't really mix all that well with the tear-stained diary approach to the lyrics do you even care if I die bleed that's right you don't you don't care what what bring it come at me bro some people might with biscuit at the top of the throne when it comes to these rap metal fusions being so terrible but even they had a shade of intent when it came to their songs sounding kind of silly for me last resort really does take the crap cake no question number 2 Sugar Ray's fly it hurts to even say it you know III don't really hate Sugar Ray and concept I do think they have a few really catchy songs that I do enjoy like every morning and I do have a soft spot in my heart for the song Mean Machine Mean Machine has a special place in my heart because it's on the Road Rash 64 soundtrack but the really horrible and tasteless pop rock reggae fusion that happens on this song is like a terrible just mutation in modern music the song really becomes excruciating thanks to the ad-libs brought by vocalist super cat on the song who I don't even know why you was invited to this in the first place spread your love on fly hit the with the eye with the empanada laura mercier on top of the really terrible ad-libs that flow like sewage throughout this track but this song is also host to one of my other least favorite lyrical cliches flying this guy just wants to fly this guy wants to fly away this guy wants to have you come fly away with him this guy is learning to fly meanwhile this guy believes that he can fly it makes me wish that I could fly to another world where people don't think flying is such a big deal because flying technology is more advanced and readily available over here we don't have songs about Wi-Fi or velcro or escalators I really want to go up these stairs without moving my feet my feet my feet number-three Will Smith's Wild Wild West believe it or not there was a time in American history where we thought of Will Smith as more of a rapper than a movie actor Minh but as he was making this major transition from The Fresh Prince of bel-air to the big screen he tried to keep a foot in one world and a foot in the other producing some singles tailored toward the movies that he was appearing in like men in black a huge success for him in terms of a pretty entertaining movie franchise and a likeable song however this sort of make a song for your movie practice also carried over into one of Will Smith's worst movies and worse songs as well while Wild West and it's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is that makes this song excruciating I mean it is in Will Smith's usual charming bad-boy delivery Wow haha maybe what really bugs me about this song is that there is not a single good clever or entertaining punch line that seeps through the instrumentation here in its four-minute runtime don't let your lip react to want to see my hand where my hit be a big Willie killed it he killed it straight fire for hire no no more fire in big big ol Willie even though this song does ruin a perfectly good Stevie Wonder track I wish with its main sample and I am pretty glad that we're past an era where music videos were regularly used to promote awful blockbuster films I still wonder what could have been if Will Smith kept this practice up for other movies that he would put out in the future like I Robot and hitch and that earth movie he did with his son he could have spit a verse on it I'm just going to say I think it's a terrible song and leave that that I cannot go too hard into this track because it would be a little hypocritical of me honey text me number four puddle of mud she hates me in the world of post music there are a lot of migraines people say that Nickelback is the worst band in the world a lot of people including myself cannot stand to listen to Scott Stapp ripoff Eddie Vetter so unashamedly every time he opens his mouth to sing but the thing about puddle of mud is that they don't even really have any single characteristic that is defining which you could even hate them for which in my book is a hateable offense pretty much the only weapon in this band's arsenal is to write a chorus that is so dumbed down that it makes the Barenaked Ladies one week look like avant-garde poetry every time the hook to this track bashes his way into the song it feels like I'm listening to a pg-13 Kurt Cobain sing in front of a bar band that plays for chicken wings every weekend at the local barbecue place at number 5 we have Everlast's breakout single with what it's like a big change of pace from the early stuff this guy did with his own solo work and with House of Pain as well both of which are infinitely more enjoyable than the very preachy set of verses dropped on this nightmare over here sort of a weird blues hip-hop fusion that tries to shove street thugs and homeless people and pregnant girls down your throat maybe it works for other people but not particularly for me which is a total shame because I do usually like songs that address some kind of wider social issue but it's really the music here that is just too cliche for words with the strings and the guitar leads of the pots the O to smooth vocal delivery instrumentally this song just has so many genres stereotypes that it doesn't actually make room for any sounds that are good on our next track we go totally new metal with the title track to the disturbed album down with this sickness a track that's brooding it's dark it's dramatic and absolutely terrible now if you've only heard this song on the radio which is where a lot of people have heard disturb and only her disturbed then you might not be aware of what makes this track one of the worst songs mm it's basically what I would like to call a domestic-abuse solo over the bridge of the song which is exactly what it sounds like frontman David Draiman dram basically goes right into this screamed monologue reenacting what sounds like his mother beating the shine out of him which is in very bad taste and likely to bring up some horrifying memories for anybody who has had a history with physical abuse luckily the only horrible memories that come to my mind when I listen to this track are having owned the CD at one time which itself is a certain type of self-abuse from which I am never going to recover number 7 LFO summer girls with groups like one direction topping the charts right now boy bands are back but because I grew up with them I still remember the previous era of boy bands and how much I hated them because I was a boy who act rap music but in retrospect some of those songs were pretty catchy except for LFOs summer girls which is most likely one of the most awkward and painful to listen to boy band type singles to come out of this era of music right from the get-go it is very obvious that LFO does not have the singing ability the production the songwriting or even the look to be a successful boy band there aren't even five of them I need a cute one I need one with crazy hair I need a mature one I need a chubby one and on top of a blatant insult to the culinary arts of the Chinese and an Abercrombie & Fitch advertisement this song is also filled with whack a suburban white boy raps that don't really state anything yeah Shakespeare wrote a bunch of sonnets Paul Revere pretty cool guy and Michael J Fox was in fact Alex P Keaton on TV we go a little deeper into the track to learn some likes and dislikes like macaroni and cheese and purple and Kevin Bacon but not Footloose oh no you love hip-hop and rock and roll your dad took off when you were four years old Wow we turned down some dark territory there that is something I rather would have not had out there and I told you that in confidence at number eight we have the cherry poppin daddies with Zoot Suit riot remember when white people reviving swing music was cool with the exception of the Squirrel Nut Zippers me neither at number nine we have what is most likely the most infamous novelty song of all time all-time and I say novelty because it is so novel for such a huge pop song to attack deep deep like subterranean philosophical issues Socrates Locke cons Plato Marx meetcha all collectively contemplated for centuries who let the dogs out oh this track is such an excruciating combination of modern hip hop and dance music production styles with Caribbean sounds sonically the song is as attention forcing and grating as a police siren I personally find the song to be as fear-inducing - and played in a public place am I about to get arrested I started looking around I get worried as someone in trouble is there something terrible happening near me and our final song in this list of reasons that the end is near comes as a result of the Latin explosion in which a lot of artists did cause some headaches but none more for me anyway then Lou Bega with Mambo number 5 essentially this song is a really awful poppy club-friendly electrified piece of land jazz genre that you should never ever ever avoid actually you should deep deep dive into while completely avoiding anything that is this or sounds like this there's all these really awful record scratches on this song a really easy be some lifted horns and lyrically what a terrible track sort of approaching you know women as if they're ice cream flavors a little bit was swollen over here a little bit of this little were there I think the worst thing about this track that bothered me right from the get-go is that it sounds like a commercial for something it just sounds like one big fat advertisement and unfortunately once this song died down in radio play and in popularity it became advertisements after being leased out numerous times to appear in various television spots and TV shows I heard this thing redone on Bob the Builder I heard it in a Guinness ad I heard in a party City ad I remember hearing it in some kind of weird fruit/vegetable PSA at one time as well it's like a few years go by and my brain is able to very slowly put dirt on top of the pile and dig this song's grave for me in my memories but then some horrible company leases the song out and uses a Neuman commercial and reminds me that it existed at one point and that is my list of the ten worst songs of my adolescence 
8sRE0JewcSA,hello everyone a new fan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is that it's time for our monthly y-you know review where I go over gauntlet style a series of albums that I didn't get a chance to do a formal review on this past month but I'm going to talk about them here round them all up in a series of very short bite-sized videos I hope you enjoy them down there in the description will link you to a playlist where you can catch more of our why you know reviews and that's it here is the video it's better than excuse my french it's it's better than excuse my french and don't try to take that away from mr. Montana because it's true okay it's true [Music] I've stepped out of my body to tell you that the Southland is boring it's going to put you to sleep boring boring if you're looking for some funky groovy R&B and neo-soul with some nice live organic instrumentation check this thing out I think it's a Jameson's most promising project so far but you know I will say in the future maybe some more instrumental dynamics maybe some more risks taken with the songwriting because even as short as this project is I think it did run a little one-dimensional by the time it was sort of near its finish but still the great performances great singing some good songwriting very passionate singing on this thing I don't know again not not a lot of bad things to say I just I just was was wanting more by the end of the project wanting more sounds more variety more of everything but you know there's like a strong baseline of talent here to sort of build upon build big and great things upon finally what I've always wanted big chiffon and Coldplay are the same fucking song I know it's taken me a while to comment on this but you know it's it's it's not because it took me a long time to figure out it was good that's it's really not the reason I'm going to be honest site I just see no reason to be excited about a Meek Mill project at this point I'd I really don't I don't see the hype just kind of seems like your average lazy day indie rock record to me I have nothing else to say so now all the original thrash metal bands sound over the hill and the bands essentially that are 10 to 20 years younger than them and are reviving that sound sound over the hill now - we're fucked I don't know I mean while this is by no means a terrible Boris album it's incredibly recorded it's super heavy like the drones are powerful and intoxicating you could really get lost in the sound of this album in a lot of ways this is really Boris's triumphant return to sludgy er droney er du mir territory I mean we haven't heard the band embraced this sound this deep and this sort of long-winded in this ambient in a way in a long time however I just feel like a lot of what Boris is doing is so typical for them at this point and it's just so much less I guess layered and intricate and innovative as a lot of the music in this style they've released in the past I mean if you're a hardcore Boris fan and you most likely are if you have interest in this record you most likely heard their older records in this style if you're stumbling upon and you care about this album you're probably going to hear just a lot of familiar territory here and if you merely want to hear the band indulge in a lot of things they've done before maybe with less finesse and and less cutting-edge ideas be my guest but it just kind of strikes me as a little average there are a few highlights on this thing but you know a lot of typical tracks and a lot of average tracks just kind of feels like foster the people's usual bland very safe very middle-of-the-road songwriting style without many memorable qualities to it sort of laid on top of more contemporary production more boomy pieces of percussion you know the the Humble Indie and somewhat psych pop-influenced sounds that they sort of rode in on are completely gone and now they're just riding over a bunch of gutless synthetics and I don't know just just doesn't really feel like anything just like before but even worse this is essentially one of those producer curated projects where there's a few good singles a few good bangers here and there but for the most part it lacks direction it lacks a strong character and persona it runs like a compilation the song quality is greatly dependent on whether or not the guest on the track is good or gives a good performance you know I will probably look forward to maybe a Muramasa single here and there in the future but an entire album oh oh oh like I can't I can't I can't I cannot with these vocals I cannot I just hands ition have you given these albums a listen did you love them did you hate them what would you rate them you're the best you're the best which should I review next simply like to like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're angry click on the video next to my head watch another video hang out longer with you boy or click on the link to a subscribe to the channel and that's it thank you very much for watching catch you in the next video or ever 
N65_VUOVT6o,hi everyone bad they need a tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and not feeling good but you know it doesn't give a shit this new Dying Fetus album the wrong one to fuck with which is kind of exactly how I feel right now so latest record from Maryland death metal outfit eighth album release now on relapse records which is no surprise as the band has been putting out music for years on relapse records and asked to be expected this is yet another album from Dying Fetus sacrificing at the altar of brutal death metal if you thought death metal was a really abrasive neish idiosyncratic genre try brutal death metal and even harsher uglier take on the original sound of death metal with heavier guitars harder grooves more guttural vocals that border on being like be steel throaty grunts and gargles more gruesome lyrics and album covers this genre is explicit in every sense of the word it's a pretty nasty unforgiving style of music and Dying Fetus is one of the few bands that has kind of scaled the corpse pile of groups that have sprung up since the 90s and it's pretty easy to see why given what separates them from their fellow brutalist s-- there's an incredible tightness to the guitars the bass the drums on nearly every Dying Fetus album but the band is able to execute this without sounding too mechanical too rigid they still keep the visceral cathartic feel of the performance and their recordings you also have the uniquely hideous and versatile vocal stylings of frontman and guitarist John Gallagher you usually have some pretty creative guitar work laced into every Dying Fetus album and the band assist for a brutal death metal band has just the knack for being kind of catchy though I do like my death metal to be gruesome and nasty and brutish Dying Fetus is far from being one of those bands that's just simply more ruckus than they are rhythm as you can hear from some of their best work like reign supreme or destroy the opposition now of course all of these sounds all these talents their trademark style pretty much carries over onto their latest release over here which right from the start does look like a little bit of a departure for the band like they've kind of nixed their big bold letter logo or something that's like really twisted and almost black metal inspired and this record also kind of breaks tradition with the typical run time of a dying foetus album which usually dips just before the 40-minute mark the wrong one to fuck with on the other hand is 50 minutes long and there's a bonus track on top of that just in case you didn't get what the band was trying to say with the title I guess dying fetuses music can be pretty nasty and I'm sitting here wondering whether or not a run time this long will actually do their music any favors especially since the band's last record was like this renewed devotion to the Brutalism of brutal death metal with less technical flashiness harder riffs more bombastic drums you know because there is such a thing as too much of a good thing and it's not like the band hasn't put out a record before in the past that was just kind of run-of-the-mill now while the wrong one to fuck with may have been constructed by nearly the same blueprint as almost every Dying Fetus album up until this point the band has kind of done it again with a series of tracks that are crushing precise well performed and produced in comparison with their last record there seems to be an increase of very intricate guitar leads flashy technical guitar work which can kind of make or break a track some of these flashy er spots do add up to some of the most memorable moments on a song and they do break up a lot of the heavier harder more mosh friendly riffs on the record however there are some spots on this record where this virtuosity almost goes to waste case in point the very beginning moments of the opening track on this thing fixated on devastation on which Gallagher and company come up with you know this really amazing very speedy guitar line that sing Capades with the bass and the drums very tightly but the band has this tendency to come up with these almost genius little mini compositions within an entire song and then they'll take that and they'll just repeat it over and over and over to sort of fill space before they hit the first big rift of the song or the next big riff in the forthcoming passage in a track and honestly even though some of these passages may be exhilarating and exciting and dizzying and require a lot of technical ability for the band to sort of concentrate on such a micro level on one single bar of a track and then just hone in on that but then not think on the Mac the entire song and whether or not just repeating almost literally copying and pasting that single section again and again and again several times does that actually do anything for the song because while these parts may be cool the novelty wears off every single time I hear again and again and again thankfully this is not so much a detriment to this track or any other song on this record that it ruins the entirety of the track and most of the time when the band does work in these more technical passages when they repeat them they add in a little bit of a subtle variation just to kind of break it up and make it seem like we're still progressing forward rather than creating the sensation where I feel like I'm caught in a technical death metal loop in the middle of a brutal death metal track I will say also as long as I'm complaining the drumming does occasionally sound a little mechanical especially the bass drums which had this very rigid constant rolling sort of sensation to them where there's no real variation in tone or volume or anything like that and this has long sort of been a production trademark of a lot of technical death metal bands Dying Fetus is not alone in that but I guess I don't so much mind it because a lot of the riffs on here are skull-crushing the guitars do sound heavy the rest of the kit does not sound nearly as flat and as mechanical as the kick drums do overall it still does sound like I'm listening through a very human performance and let's face it the majority of the drumming on this thing is incredible now as far as the riffs and the grooves on this record to sort of separate them out of these more technical passages they're crazy they're demented they create such an onslaught throughout the entire album I feel like I'm just getting bashed with each different riff and they pair so well with the vocals it's like with each new record Dying Fetus is just finding these subtle ways to improve just a little bit a little bit a little bit and just become more murderous like on the song die with integrity on the first leg of this track we have a few moments where the growled vocals are kind of layered up on top of each other for this really gruesome sound it's like actually really disgusting and the song structure on this track as is the case with most songs on this record is really linear it's winding with the exception of a few songs on the record the band doesn't revisit a whole lot of riffs and passages for the sake of memorability or catchiness so as I kept listening to this thing it's like I was able to kind of just peel back one more layer of deacon hoes skin and kind of commit more of the intricacies of this record to memory though it is worth noting that a lot of what you hear on this record will probably be familiar to you if you've heard past Dying Fetus projects especially the more basic thrashy riffs on this album which the band has probably written tons of variations of very similar riffs over the area especially on the song unmitigated detestation or the song ideological subjugation which in my opinion is kind of an entry level death metal 101 class on a writing brutal riffs it's also worth noting that there are some points on this album the band's riffs do break into some pretty slow tempos that seemed almost metalcore inspired occasionally death metal purists who kind of hate you know more hardcore centric death metal heavier death metal more breakdown oriented death metal might be a little disappointed but it didn't really bother me I felt it just kind of made the album more dynamic and it's not like the band harps on these moments for all that long most of the time these tracks are actually really dense and it's that density it's that continuous challenge but also continuous excitement and adrenaline that really makes the album for me even though the thing does last 50 minutes a few of the tracks flow into each other pretty nicely as well like be very slow ominous riffs that kick off weaken the structure actually feel like an extension off of the thrash Iver groovy riffs that end the track right before it now it's around this point on the album where just about any other Dying Fetus record would be trying to find a way to wrap it up however that doesn't happen we still have several more tracks to go and in my opinion Dying Fetus doesn't entirely justify this extended leg of this album they're still dishing out quality tracks but it's not like songs such as fallacy really bring much that previous songs didn't already even if I do like some of the speedy guitar melodies that kick the track off even if I do like the beautifully melodic solo passage in the middle of the track even if I do like some of the technical passages on unmitigated detestation and the closing track is easily one of the catchiest songs on the entire project it hits this really throttling case almost from beginning to end the vocals kind of reach this peak of ferocity as if the band was saving the best for last I could not stop bobbing my head some of the riffs on this thing which are incredibly hard-hitting it was just you know another decent bunch of material on the record I just wish maybe a few of the more minor cuts earlier in the tracklisting just been you know cast off the island so these songs could take their place especially the bonus track which is actually one of the nastiest songs on the entire thing I think anybody who's been listening to Dying Fetus since the 2000s at this point can pretty much say that they got what they expected with this record however given the bar the band has set for themselves in the past with some of their best records they really do write and perform at a very high quality level so to kind of hear an album where the band is continuing to do what they continue to do as well as they've done it in the past it's kind of not really that much of a disappointment it's actually a really great thing and in my opinion this thing is easily one of the best brutal death metal albums I've heard since their last frickin album and will most likely be one of the best death metal records of this year I'm feeling a strong seven - a light eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I do next did the like if you like we subscribe and please don't cry just leave

GlSqTuuvfdg,haha hi everyone Anthony shara moosi here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new vic mensa album the autobiography vic mensa is a chicago rapper singer-songwriter formerly of the band kids days and this is his long-awaited commercial full-length debut album it's been about four years since vic broke through as a solo artist with his internet tape and it's been a little touch and go from there like he hasn't put out a lot of material since the release of that kind of attention-grabbing well-received project outside of a couple eps and some spotty singles here and there some of which were kind of mediocre like that one with skrillex collectively all of this material doesn't really add up too much of a artistic direction going into this album i really did not know what to expect because his EPS his singles prior were just all over the place I just had no idea where Vic was going to go with this thing but now we finally have the album a substantive artistic statement a vision of who Vic is as an artist especially with a title as bold as the autobiography however now that the project is finally here I'm not hearing a whole lot that is really putting Vic in his own lane because honest thing he's just kind of sounding like an amalgamation of his contemporaries the autobiography kind of shoots for the conceptual 'ti of a Kendrick Lamar project as well as the anthemic musicality of a kanye album and a lot of Vic's rap styles on this thing feels subtly bitten off of Jay Cole now all these sounds come together pretty seamlessly it keeps Vic from feeling like you know just simply a copy of one single artists but a good deal of the time I don't really feel like these characteristics add up to all that much at least not a large coherent exciting statement a lot of the production feels pretty contemporary pretty trap influenced a lot of the time but there are beats on here that do transport me to a few different points in Kanye's career there are some cuts here that feature the balladry of 808s and heartbreak a couple of the intro tracks like say I didn't or memories on 47th Street or home record featuring Weezer these instrumentals kind of throw me back to the early years in Kanye's discography where he was chopping up a lot more soul music I'm actually kind of impressed that these instrumentals bring back a lot of the fundamentals of the beats of bling air rap without sounding too dated meanwhile the track down for some ignorant sounds like a slightly paler version of the Chief Keef or Travis Scott inspired trap that lived on yeezus I can kind of smell the stench of wolves still hanging on Vic - I also like the eerie nocturnal track beat on the song heaven on earth it has these kind of beautiful cycled little melodic samples playing throughout and the smooth somber scents on the song wings featuring production from Pharrell is actually a nice change of pace - features this beats which up over which Vic brings like this really speedy flow this lyrical intensity talking about addiction suicide it's or it's a real dark point on the record for the most part the production on this thing is really tasteful and helps the album out a lot it's one of the true highlights of the record and it's not hard to see why given that no ID has his hands and pretty much most of the production on this thing I think that's pretty much the only reason Vic is able to get away with so many grand four to five minute musical diatribes on this record and have it not just sound like really deflated and over raw and boring now as far as the concept on this thing goes I mean it's there but it's also kind of not there considering the title of this thing we would expect Vic to get autobiographical on this thing maybe some kind of look backwards into his life which is fine but even if this record wasn't named the autobiography I mean we would kind of expect Vic going into this album to rap about himself anyway occasionally on this thing we get these spoken word passages that sounds like Vic is writing a letter to kind of guide the audience from one song topic to the next but it's not like he revisits this idea where includes these interludes so often that they create some kind of story or theme across the record it's like we only get them once in a while when Vic really has a story he wants to tell on track Hendrix poem on to pimp a butterfly comes to mind but what Vic is doing here is just way less effective now the weakest link in the chain on this album has to unquestionably be Vick menses vocals now that's not to say he's a bad rapper he's actually a very capable rapper who showcases a lot of talent across this record but his singing voice which he does use quite often on this thing does leave a lot to be desired and because I feel like he gets so much of his rap style on this record from Jay Cole I can't help but feel like he suffers from a lot of the same problems that Cole does on his projects like for one almost every track here has at least one or two bars that are really bad or kind of cringy or corny like on the opener where he's talking about Tooting his own horn like Cole train or on memories on 47th where he's talking about taking over the world like Pinky and the brain and I can kind of see this line working if you gave it like a little bit of a tongue-in-cheek or self aware or kind of ironic tone to it but he said he's totally serious here fists in the air like rocky bitch I think my name Sylvester or on the song heaven on earth where he's rapping on the first verse essentially a letter to a dead friend of his which is totally fine actually a song concept I like I'm loving this song until we get to the second verse where he is rapping from the standpoint of his friend from heaven back to him and then he's rapping about his buddy smoking with Kurt Cobain which that's not really the kicker here Kurt Cobain eventually relays the message back to Vic that hey man Kurt Cobain here really like your music you're doing a great job keep it up which is a little self congratulatory to say the least I think it's also worth mentioning at this point that Vic has a little bit of a savior complex on this album or at least a little bit of a hero complex which I think gives him a bit of a false sense of security like his lyrics and what he's saying doesn't exactly need to be up to snuff it can be a little corny here and there because ultimately what he's trying to say the overall message is really meaningful it's really important but in my opinion I mean what he is spitting on this record is not any more poignant than what a lot of his contemporaries are saying it's not like he's hit upon kind of nerve or root here or some kind of you know deep understanding of his topics that no other artists who is his better has approached obviously Vic's lyrics are not the worst that you're going to hear and most of the time I think he overcomes these samples of corn with the bulk of his verses the rest of his verses being pretty quality and delving very nicely into some pretty deep and pretty gritty themes of addiction and violence his youth betrayal success there are a lot of kind of riveting chapters of Vic's life story and they play out pretty well on this album however the love songs are really where this thing suffers which starts with the song home record and I pretty much love the instrumental on this track but the topic is so douchey it's essentially about Vic pissing off his significant other because she's she's caught him cheating and he shows very little remorse for his behavior and the song centers mostly around just his girlfriend going crazy and breaking things wrecking the home home-wrecking because of his behavior we both made mistakes baby and instead of just kind of being a moment where he self reflects or something like that again the whole thing to centers around what she's doing in her behavior not what he did to sort of set off the situation or kind of get the ball rolling and the song gorgeous is even worse because Vic is essentially giving us another song about cheating where he's playing two girls at once and essentially why he can't stop which I could sort of see a song concept like this working if it were to be kind of funny or flirty or but instead Vic kind of uses this opportunity to rap about essentially why he can't help himself and drops amazing bars here like you want to own me like copyright but a shooting star so hard to hold down uh she had a pumpkin ass how could I not smash that's so bad but the absolute worst has to be the song coffee and cigarettes where Vic is essentially trying to pull off this heartfelt ballad about a young love who he had strong feelings for it feels almost as if he wishes that he could have stayed with her or gone with her kind of forged this long-lasting relationship with her that he would keep until this day and respect I'm sure given of the previous material on here and this is really where Vic's singing falters like his singing especially when he's like reaching to his upper register and straining his voice sounds terrible the lyrics are filled with all this like melodramatic and cliched you know symbolism and similes and metaphors like cigarettes ashing and writing our names on bridges and public property I wish you love me as much as you love weed I know you like to smoke like my mother-in-law was laughing her ass off at this song and just could not stop talking about how terrible it was the song we could be free that's effectively the closing track of the album is a kind of a general statement on race relations asking the listener to put themselves in the shoes of their enemy to kind of facilitate some sort of understanding less prejudice less hatred the verses between these hooks Vic essentially weaves in elements of his life story again some weeks singing vocals on this thing but ty dolla sign's spectacular features on this track actually tie up some of the vocal moments nicely but somehow I don't really feel like this track works that much as a closer like it's not much of a final statement about everything Vic has said up until this point it just kind of feels that way because it leaves the album on a kind of upbeat hopeful vibe I mean overall this album was alright I mean Vic could have certainly made a worse album sure there's some very thoughtful and grand and personal highs on this record but there are also some very cringy lows too there's some pretty good production on here there's a lot of passable rapping a barely existent concept you know it's just kind of an average album that was clearly shooting for much more than it actually accomplished I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what's your dire view next hit the

wpOna_7hIzM,hi everyone sorry Sydney girl Tanana the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Amon a album good for you this is the commercial debut album from Oregon rapper Amy May and this release over here lined up very nicely with his recent 2017 double XL freshmen cover he had a nice freestyle he performed pretty well in the cypher he was actually one of the few rappers in this year's freshman class that struck me as having any lasting power a potential career and pretty much all the tracks I've heard from this guy so far featured bouncing production some sticky hooks a smooth kind of subdued rap style that embedded itself in my head and a kind of clever carefree and somewhat comedic tone to the lyrics which occasionally run kind of romantic or introspective unfortunately though this album is not really the fun somewhat quirky maybe a little risky and left-field pop rap album that I was pulling for though it certainly tries and really implies that that was kind of what it was shooting for my issue generally was good for you is just that it does not go deep enough and I don't mean in a sense that the songs aren't meaningful this thing is just super safe and very one-dimensional and that's all as a rapper I mean a while he may reveal some very personal truths here and there he's far from being a versatile artist and performer his somewhat alternative rap style really kind of grows old and monotonous as the album drags on it just slowly becomes this vocal drone that hangs in the background leaving the production to really steal the show but it's not like the beats on this thing are so colorful and fantastic and cutting edge that they really kind of carry the album instead of being smart and playful most of the time what this album does is just simply opts for sunny and bland like on wedding crashers featuring offset whose feature on the track is so forgettable and so by the numbers for offset that I can't really even recall any of it the song features kind of a smooth track beat I mean a over much of the song moaning about his ex-lovers and how he'll never attend their weddings and hopefully this song is playing while there dancing while the track might seem kind of silly and funny on the surface it's also just like one number one spot away from being transformed into a Kidz Bop tune the song Spice Girl is slightly funnier with its constant lyrical references to the legendary girl group's most memorable lyrics but hominy is general lack of enthusiasm on the track just leaves the song feeling not quite as fun as I think it could be I'm trying to appreciate the emotional balance that Amin a is attempting to strike on this album it's almost like I'm listening to a rapper that has a little bit of a comedic tone kind of a tongue-in-cheek thing going on but he also is a little emotionally sensitive it's like I'm listening to a crying clown or a record that you can dance to while depressed but I feel like what I got an actuality here is just a record that doesn't really know what it wants what it wants to do no sure or pointed or clear direction for this thing so instead of settling on a sound an idea a style this album just kind of settles on being mellow and relaxed which makes the record very easy to listen to but also very easy to forget this relaxed approach also hurts some of the songwriting as well on this thing as some of the tracks like hero for example and very abruptly and feel kind of unfinished the song STFU has this really obnoxious auto-tune chorus that feels like one of the biggest gimmicks on the entire record and the song blind says some of the tightest flows most interesting lyrics and jazz iasts hardest grooviest instrumental of the entire album but it's just kind of like this one-minute interleaved in the midst of all of these semi slow jams that really needed a bigger break up the song of Sundays is pretty slow and very introspective actually a highlight for me on this record it's just kind of this very lacks stoner rap that I knew I was going to get going into this record and that I knew a Monnet was going to perform pretty well like this is really where he shows a lot of his strengths with the details of his family and talking about how he's religious but too lazy to go to church there's a verse on this thing that I actually believe I heard in his double XL freestyle he plays to a somewhat similar vibe on the song turf where he combines some very speedy rapping with us do delivery and a kind of hypnotic trap be it's fine and again given what I had heard of him in the past and his rap style this is sort of a direction that I expected him to go and expected him to pull off well but I kind of hoped going into this album he would have a little bit more to offer there's just a lot of very average forgettable and a very unambitious material on this project I don't really get a sense after listening to this entire album exactly who M&A is as an artist because I feel like the production on this thing his voice is flows his lyrics they're all too middle-of-the-road occasionally some lyrics do stick out but not always for the right reasons like Jesus Christ this lilo and stitch line although I do like Charlie Wilson's vocals on the track that this bar comes from there's just a severe lack of anything refreshing or engaging or exciting on this thing and I get it not everything needs to be deep but it's not like this album is crazy and ignorant or blood-pumping there's just not a shortage right now of rap music that works pretty much as background music that you can listen to passively and it just kind of hangs there I mean a is an artist who I think is punching under his weight on this album he's selling himself short if he can successfully make an album that implies it's weirder and funnier than it actually is imagine if he made an album that really operates on that level because on this thing I feel like I'm listening to a class clown that has no jokes or that I'm just peeling back the veil to get the view into the life of a sad stoner I think this guy has more to offer than what he's giving us and or at least I hope that that's the case I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition have you given this I mean a album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it

CSLAZM54ZcQ,okay here we go hi everyone get an aberrant the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Arcade Fire album everything now this is the latest full-length album from Montreal indie outfit actually indie legends Arcade Fire this is their fifth studio album and now it's been well over ten years since the band's debut album funeral genre-defining record a high point for indie rock tons of epic lavishly arranged songs on this thing packed with passionate vocals the record also in my opinion has a flawless flow and then the band followed that up a few years later with the equally epic Neon Bible a record that featured a lot of religious themes heavenly musical highs dark depressing lows and then the band's third record I also enjoyed the suburbs it was kind of like a little baby in a sugar bowl the band going in a little bit more of a socially conscious direction this time around more of a societal scope to their criticism their most direct album yet in my opinion as far as like the sound of a rock album goes lots of very strong Springsteen influences on a couple cuts here and then AB and delivered the sudden stylistic pivot with their record reflector several years ago the album boasted production from LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy and featured the band's most danceable material yet pulling influence directly from the worlds of disco and new wave now personally in my opinion this is where the band in their discography had first faltered easily the most inconsistent Arcade Fire album so far I thought it was kind of bloated the whole double disc thing really could have been cut down every step outside of the band's comfort zone felt like a haphazard experiment and not only that but as a dance music band Arcade Fire is mediocre at best coming away from reflector I had hoped that this record would just simply be a phase for the band but it's not a phase mom it's not a phase ah the dance beats are here to stay on the band's latest effort hear everything now which from the sound of the singles alone felt like the band is going to be going deeper into this territory and in fact they do there's not really a single moment on this album that feels like it kind of throws back to an older Arcade Fire which there were at least several on reflector it's almost like the transition is complete on this new record over here take the title track for example with it's glamorous shimmering instrumental reads a lot like an Abba instrumental except for wind Butler's lead vocals and the weird freakin woodwinds toward the end of the track that are actually not that good it's a song that I kind of have a love-hate relationship with my first impression of it was like oh here we go again I don't want more of this the last thing I want to hear is our cave fire indulging in this sound again however with repeated listens the song kind of won me over with it's dazzling piano melodies and lyrics about the oversaturation of the Information Age I kind of get the sense that the band is critiquing it trying to satirize it a little bit on this track but yet the instrumentation is just so glamorous and beautiful that I don't know it's it's almost like they're paying tribute to it as well like we're living in the middle of a beautiful glorious future where technology has phased out a lot of the inconveniences of mankind I think the maximal materialistic mentality of the modern age is an interesting topic for a band to approach on a record especially a group that is of an age where they most likely remember a time when they were younger where computers didn't rule almost every aspect of your life I kind of also get this vibe on the song signs of life where it feels like the band is a yearning for some kind of human or emotional connection but they just can't get it this track even though I was kind of lukewarm on it when I first heard it also won me over with its irresistible disco grooves and honestly just a few tracks into the track listing here I was kind of getting convinced that maybe Arcade Fire has turned over a new leaf and is now successfully going to be creating dance music on this thing I was really being convinced it was possible especially with Daft Punk's Thomas Bangalter on production duties on this thing as well as Steve Mackey of pulp however it does not take long for everything now to completely fall apart in concept in Arrangements in writing in everything the song creature comfort has one of the most wonderful grooves on the entire record features these kind of buzzy throbbing since sequences that are very steady some glassy reverberating lead melody some roaring guitar chords that can song an epic feel but when the lyrics come in wind butler starts forcing this somewhat socially conscious message with these gender stereotypes that feel like they're lifted right out of the tones of a really depressing tumblr post boys that hate their dads and girls that cut themselves and want to commit suicide because they have body image issues these are not inherently bad things to sing about but our Kade fires approach is just so surface-level and given the concept of the album but man doesn't really do anything to connect this to I don't notice the mental oversaturation of again the modern day outside of kind of portraying these kids as wanting to be famous and these depictions of young people with emotional issues breach into narcissism when the band depicts this female protagonist as wanting to die she gets into the bathtub she's getting ready to commit suicide but she puts that first Arcade Fire album on first like really you know I didn't want to kill myself until I heard that even if this story is true like to include it in the way that the band did it just seems really self congratulatory and super meta at a moment when maybe we should be focusing on I don't know what the individual here is doing and why it really only gets worse from there as our Kaede Fire embarks upon a couple of reggae fusions on the next few tracks the band failed at flirting with this sound on their last record so I did not want a second helping however the instrumental to the song Peter Pan is actually not that bad there are lots of interesting textures throughout the track it's not quite as flat and as one-dimensional as like here comes the nighttime from reflector it leaves a little to be desired from a lyrical standpoint it seems kind of like just a very general love song but it is written from the heart as opposed to chemistry which feels like it's written from the hips when you read into the lyrics on this thing it actually comes off a little stalkerish not to mention the refrain kind of gets annoying after several listens it is a bit of an earworm though and oddly enough this instrumental not only brings another reggae groove but on the chorus it mixes it with these roaring hard rock riffs which come together pretty seamlessly as much as an abomination as the song is from like a lyrical standpoint and our writing standpoint it's just far too corny and sugary of the song for Arcade Fire to pull off with with the lack of irony that they're trying to still I do have to kind of give it to the band for like really kind of getting these two worlds to collide somewhat effectively after this the album kind of devolves further almost like it knows it's not going to redeem itself at this point with these two tracks infinite content and infinite underscore content it's pretty much the same half written song one portion of it is this fast punk tinged indie track that kind of brings back the album central theme in the lyrics and then all of a sudden that ends and we get a slow dreamy country version of the track and then we get to electric blue which is easily the worst track on the record and not for its colorful keyboards and nocturnal grooves no it's because of one we have a really annoying lead melody that sounds like a some kind of animal being strangled and then that sound is like sampled into something rhythmic and then there are the completely unintelligible falsetto vocals from regime chisaem who I am usually pretty excited to hear on an arcade fire album usually when she brings some lead vocals on a cut it steals the show provides a nice break up in the tracklist here I want nothing more than the song to stop because her nasal like almost eardrum piercing vocal tone is so hideous I mean even her backup vocals at a couple points on the record are really shrill and brittle and just not very Oh wool after this the band tries to cool things down with the somewhat drab good goddamn a track where I kind of like the wordplay going on in the chorus that kind of ties into the visual of this person committing suicide that I feel like we were hit with on creature comfort the band is returning to it here and the you know wanting a good goddamn are sort of looking for a good goddamn sort of a angle in the hook is essentially either talking about oh I wish you know some God was up there who cared about this or some God would intervene or you know do something or fix the situation or you know a good goddamn meaning someone's interest or concern or help revisiting this feeling of loneliness in this really overwhelming world a strong feeling of isolation but these are feelings and these are intentions that I feel like I myself am projecting on the track given its concept there's not a whole lot in the lyrics here that actually kind of gives that away to me and not because I think the band is trying to be obscure or sort of hide some intentions or meanings of this track just once again I feel like wind Butler's vocals his lyrics rather are kind of approaching this topic at a very surface manner and once again we get this visual of put your food on booth and yes we know what that favorite record is it's the first Arcade Fire album thank you the song put your money on me miraculously is actually a pretty wonderful love song with ABBA vibes coming back into the fold toward the tail end of the track the song has a very cute course that essentially asks one's lover to put money on him bent on him being a sure thing that on him being there and being a faithful companion even though the instrumental is a bit of a slow burner it does have a very steady nice groove to it and it is worth your patience and the closing track matches these very lovesick vibes with this sense of heartache and longing that's pretty nice however I feel like this track kind of fails as any kind of wrap-up or summation to this very dodgy inconsistent album and concept the band is sort of thrown into our laps here it's hardly an effective send-off to this very lopsided project that being said the actual closing track is kind of this weird outro instrumental that is a bit of a reprieve where it brings back the theme melody to the title track but with this epic large string section and then this tract loops into the introduction tract the sort of introduction interlude which originally when I heard it I think is an awful start to the record and actually kind of stalls what should be an effective beginning I mean I guess it's kind of nice at the album somewhat loops back into itself but I don't want to hear again all the way through I mean I don't really like it and I'm not all that surprised because at the end of the day I feel like I'm just kind of getting a second helping of the band's last record sure everything now may head more boldly into a dance music direction it has a somewhat more coherent theme concept to it as far as length and tracklist ingo I guess it's a bit more manageable but across the entire track listing there are only a few songs that I'm actually excited by most of the record is just merely tolerable and there are at least a decent handful of tracks that I think are downright awful like literally Arcade Fire writing and recording their worst material to date so I don't know will the band finally just turn back from this ridiculous direction they've been speeding in for their past couple of records I hope so I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you

box set for a moon shaped pool and I have a 10 inch of amnesiac and anybody who gets a shirt will be put in the running to win that all right let's go into the tracks no more BS and the worst tracks of the week Oh No Oh No who's in the worst tracks of the week first off in the worst tracks but we got to give it to a Skrillex would you ever featuring Pooh Bear unfortunately this just seems like super plain and generic and formulaic EDM for Skrillex like there's literally nothing special about this song like the the vocal on the hook is somewhat catchy but I would have never guessed this was a Skrillex track had you not told me it's just a really by-the-numbers sort of EDM anthem again with really nothing memorable about it and just kind of disappointed that with the fall of dubstep Skrillex has kind of had a hard time finding his footing with his solo work again hopefully that does happen at some point though moving on from there the new Mick Jagger song featuring Skepta England lost which is pretty much a musical reflection of a lot of the recent political happenings in the UK many of which have indirectly or directly something to do with raishin you know breaks it that whole thing however this song is horrendous this is like exactly how you don't do a political track like it sounds like a joke song actually if you're a fan of the office and I don't mean the American version I mean the original the original UK version you may remember that there were like some post office you know like videos and sort of extras featuring David Brent sort of making music with a rapper who he found like this black guy who we just wanted to have be his friend and sort of show that he's like diverse and he's you know not just some old you know stuffy white guy he likes hip-hop too he's bringing in this dude to sort of wrap on his tracks and that's kind of exactly what this sounds like it sounds like a David Brent joke song like David Brent trying to write a political track or write like a meaningful song to get other people to like him it's just a really ridiculous song and skeptics is awful like the Macaulay Culkin line is terrible and I don't know it's it's really just one of the worst songs I've heard this week and I don't really think I could say anything else about it further than that but it's actually maybe just slightly better than this new McLemore song marmalade which is this garbage new track out he has featuring little yachty which was actually so bad I didn't even stick around for the little yachty verse this song is that terrible it's really just kind of a by-the-numbers pop rap track with Macklemore slathered and a little bit of auto-tune a little effect on his voice to get him to sound like some rapper who is sort of you know cut from the same cloth as little yachty but he just sounds really fucking awkward with so many corny bars throughout this song where it seems like the irony the tongue-in-cheek attitude that sort of you know like Winkie flirty kind of vibe that usually comes through on macklemore's voice that I think he gets at least for me kind of a pass for saying some of the bullshit that he does with it's just really not here the song is just a little too dumb and self-serious and in my opinion to sort of get away with just how silly it sounds but that's it for the the worst tracks of the week let me get into the songs where I was just um you know kind of met on a little on the fence wanted to mention and wanted to shout them out because you guys might be a little more to them than I am but you know still worth worth of Nod for one this new single from YG YNS featuring black youngster and why is an Lucci you know just kind of a by-the-numbers yg track at this point but by the numbers yg track is certainly better than a bad why do you track you know you got kind of that West Coast vibe on there good beat some decent flows good head Bob's all over this thing you know lots of gritty sexual violent lyrics you know he's not fucking around yeah it's a decent song the decent track give it a nod also this new track from takashi 69 Zeta 0 0.5 featuring famous decks flosser and de globo I am hip hop is pretty much new metal now that's that's essentially what this song is telling me and I'm not 100% unhappy with that you know it's it's kind of a fun track it's a little nutty and really gimmicky and you know in 15 years this will not age well but it's pretty fun for right now so I guess we'll leave it at that Kesha has a new track out of course she's promoting her new record that's coming out very soon with another track that sort of has a lot of themes of you know letting go the past letting go of pain letting go of trauma letting go all the bad things have happened to you you know it's looking toward the future but also very nostalgic it's very uplifting it's very bright it's very positive there a lot of corney's sort of clips of hers like a little baby and a little kid sort of spliced throughout the music video it's okay you know it's it's definitely not hitting me as well as the first big ballad from this album did but it's certainly not as bad as the last single so you know we will leave it at that it's it's okay I'm not crazy about it but you know this is I guess the most I've been tolerating any songs leading up to the release of a Ke$ha album ever so you know there's something to be said about that moving on from there converge has a new single out a side and a b-side of the a side I can tell you about pain I think is just kind of a your average converge track you know it's very noisy it's got some angular guitars in there a couple post-hardcore elements and there it's very aggressive um definitely not so much that it's flooring me or Wow me or making me feel like this is new ground for converge definitely not as exciting as some of the lead singles that I heard from their last record however I am actually very impressed with the b-side of this single Eve which is actually really slow sludgy dynamic and epic reminds me of some of the slower records or cuts from their last record except you know kind of uh explored a little bit more deeply I don't know I'm just kind of a little on the fence here you know in one breath it seems like the band is really experimenting and pushing forward and trying something a little different and the other breath it's like they don't really want to let go of those things that they know their fan base kind of expects of them yeah I don't really know you know it's it's definitely worth listen but it's not the best teaser track I've heard of a converge record ever moving out from their bound Sebastian we are beautiful very bland uninteresting new single from the band unfortunately I was not very intrigued by some of the dancer tracks from their last record and they're going even further in that direction on this new single over here with like a break beat and like has a some ridiculous electronic elements which was trendy and it was in vogue and it was ruling the the charts you guys weren't into these sounds then so why are you sort of dabbling in them in a kind of cutesy way now you know it's a it's it just does not fit the band it just does not fit their style it just seems really like window dressing for a lack of solid song ideas I really don't know what to think of you know Belle and Sebastian at this point I mean of course they have so many amazing records in their back catalogue but between this last album and what I'm hearing with this new single over here the future does not look bright in my opinion future does not look bright moving on from there always you know actually the song is not too bad like again the the problem in the issue that I've had with always always is that they don't really have that distinct or memorable of a sound I would have never guessed that this is always if you had not told me however you know it is it is actually a decently written song like it's one of the few tracks from this band where it seems like there's a strong theme melody a strong lead vocal and like lyrics I can actually kind of invest in and care about you know it seems way more personal and intimate than their songs typically are which I usually feel like are a little too awash in reverb a little too disconnected a little to just kind of you know I guess kind of swimming through the atmosphere and not really engaging with the audience in any kind of significant way again this is just way more personal and in-your-face and in a very nice polite and kind of enveloping you know very welcoming sort of way I really do like this tune quite a bit and now we are onto the best tracks of the week the best best best best tracks the songs that really kind of stood out to me as being the the best track so that a real week you know alright let's let's not let's let's uh let's let's not dawdle first Tara mellows math rock band Tara mellows has a new track out Lulla out titled don't say I know which you know this is the kind of math rock that's right up to my cthulhu them man I cannot talk this is the kind of math rock that's right up my alley this is why when people ask me hey are you in the math Rock I'm like yeah you know I like bands like Drive like you and the tella that kind of is a meanness that wild experimentation that attitude that energy Tara MELAS is exemplifying that here I've had issues in the past with their production I don't think this is a perfectly produced song or anything like that but a lot of the guitar leads and riffs on this thing are crazy and off the fucking wall and the vocals are pretty zany to some weird lyrics on this thing you know this is like some really Wow like some really nutty math rock with a wild personality to an experimental edge and you know just a crazy character I love hearing rock music with personality and this certainly has it so shout out Tara MELAS on this new cut moving on from there Suzanne's son for with this new track over here titled Mountaineers featuring John Grant this is a slow burner this is the definition of a slow burner this a slow starting song really kind of sets the tone for a while don't expect this track to jump out at you but once it hits that climax at the finish it's beautiful its powerful it's wonderful its heavenly it's a orgasmic stick around for that ending please please please please please I myself was a little underwhelmed at first and I've never been a huge Suzanne son for guy but this new song over here is a really cool linear direct sort of structure to it and it really kind of builds up that tension and when it lets loose it lets loose and you know and it blossoms really beautifully I just cannot stress that enough definitely listen to the song it's a beautiful tune and wonderfully arranged once it gets to that climax moving on from there oh boy did I just go to the top I think I did but I'm going to continue from here best song over here for my week possibly maybe is this new Charli XCX track boys this is a wonderful playful flirty little ballad from a Charli XCX about voice you know there's nothing really much to say about it other you know it is what it is but it's a very fun entertaining song and I highly recommend the music video for this thing because guys guys boys guys can be sexy too guys can be sexy too we can be sexy I love this track I have the message of sends love the music video let's keep going ah on this album cover stop it stop it ah if you saw this thing sort of looking at you in the corner of the room what would you do I would scream and get the fuck out of there because this is freakiest fuck this is the new album cover for the forthcoming Chelsea wolf album this track over here new song titled vex and man this song is dark as hell not only is a heavy and dense and foreboding like a lot of the material from her previous record but also she brings in some crazy deep guttural like death metal vocals under the fold on this track and I think it does her sound wonders it does her sound wonders it a lot for the track sounds heavy and aggressive as hell and I'm just loving the direction that Chelsea has been going in I mean metal has always been sort of a reference point for Chelsea certainly in her music but now she's just like fully embracing it and like the sound is just great so all the all the power in the world all the praise in the world with Chelsea wolf listen to track over here from The Killers which I'm really surprised that I loved killers run for cover this is just a really peppy energizing pop rock whether that pop rock track with just a lot of guts I don't know man it's just a song with a lot of guts this is the most energized and electrifying I've heard The Killers sounding in years and while I'm still not anticipating the album that they're going to be coming out with soon will be great this is certainly got to be a highlight for me on that record beautiful song and definitely one of the most fun singles I've heard this year and the last track I'm going to shout out is the new ski mask the slump god song catch me outside he came out with a little tape a little project recently that was on the front page of iTunes and Apple music that I gave a listen to there were some good songs on there there were some good bangers please do not underestimate ski mask with slump god he may seem like another one of these soundcloud rappers but he's a little darker he's a little stranger in this dude has a crazy flow like it gets insane on that new album how fast he flows I'm not saying that his lyrics are super deep or anything but he does have some very funny and weird references that he pulls from on time to time I wouldn't say that's so much the selling point of this new track over here this new song has some really kind of crazy off-kilter very funky production and his flow is just like so he just hits some crazy pockets all over this beat and it's just so freakin polyrhythmic and groovy and insane I like the music video too kind of feels like a you know an acid trip out of here and Loathing in Las Vegas or something like that it's just really off-the-wall and insane and this dude just has loads and loads and loads of personality you know he's not one of these generic track rappers he's not some angsty dark stupid soundcloud rapper who's like you know talking about you know you guys are peasants and you're stupid and I hate you you know though he does very much fuck with xxx tortillas you know he but still he's on his own thing he's got his own vibe he's got his own sound he's got his own sort of aesthetic and I'm really liking what he's doing with it so that is going to be it guys those are our best and worst tracks of the week our weekly track roundup thank you very much for watching I hope you got some good recommendations out of this thing again as I have said in the past

fEOCbc9lYXE,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for our monthly great album segment where I go over a bunch of Records that I enjoyed quite a bit this past month recommend them to you just in case they slipped through the cracks links to all the reviews are down there in the description box and let's let that let the let the recommendation is begin number one miraculously I enjoyed the new Tyler the Creator album alive flower boy I did not anticipate that that that I would like this I did not anticipate that it would be Tyler's best produced album I did not anticipate that it would be his best performed album as far as his rapping goes so many aspects of Tyler's music that have always been good have just smoothed out and matured so beautifully and I feel like this is the album where we're finally getting like a deep introspective dive into Tyler's developed psyche it's almost got me like you know wanting to re-listen to every single thing he's put out so far multiple times just to kind of take in the full progression and the full scope of what brought him here to this point but you know lots of beautiful jazzy instrumentation on this thing more thoughtful lyrics few few bangers high points aggressive points on the album that have quite a bit of energy great guest singers and features just not a lot to critique about this album outside of kind of a rough ending and just a wish that the themes and the concept of the album came together a little bit more tightly and greatly but obviously Tyler has progressed and evolved a lot since this past couple of Records it still seems like there's room to improve room to evolve and I'm sort of excited to see that progress happen because especially with a record like this under his belt now that potential is just very much real next pissed jeans while of now post hardcore noise rock band pissed jeans coming through with their most tribal are aggressive heavy and muscular album yet with hilariously dark and very tongue-in-cheek lyrics all over this it is a little inconsistent the flow is kind of weird there are a few tracks the feel maybe slightly redundant and you know of course the band does tend to wear their influences on their sleeves but this is a blood pumping and a very entertaining album with lots of satirical interesting lyrics throughout high energy high adrenaline and very thoughtful to next jay-z 444 jay-z comes through the record that's almost like him like vlogging or something great instrumentals very raw very jazzy very stripped down from no ID and jay-z really getting introspective on this thing like it's really sort of revealing a side to himself that he hasn't on any other record prior and of course he goes into a little bit his marriage transgressions against Beyonce it's it's a very interesting record it's an interesting record for those who want to sort of hear more from jay-z the icon the persona the person as I said in my review this is really his first album as not just simply jay-z but Shawn Carter next I have to give a shout out to the new guerrilla toss album GT ultra this is like a funky wacky left-field New Wave record really brings back the sounds of new way from the 80s and the late 70s that have kind of been forgotten with time I feel like the sounds of synth pop have kind of dominated a lot of the new wave revival that we've seen recently but we haven't heard a lot of groups like gorilla toss over here embracing you know the sounds of groups like ecstasy where you know you're getting those funkier bass lines those kookier electronics GT ultra really kind of brings all of that and more you know some new modern experimental flares a lot of interesting tunes a lot of energy a lot of pep a lot of character and it just makes me excited even more to hear what the band is going to be doing in the future love love love this thing it is a tad short does leave me watching more but it's great and finally got to give a shout out to the new very versatile and very passionate very dark very textured and very well written new Algiers album the underside of power algae continues this streak of writing politically-charged music that fuses elements of soul and gospel and blues with Punk and post-punk and gothic music like a really weird crossroads of sounds for this band songs and I feel like they come together even more seamlessly on this new record over here not only that but some of the best material some of the best songs the band has ever written to date on this thing you know most notably the title track really proud that these guys are continuing to evolve and mature and definitely keep an eye in an ear out for what they're doing on this record and for what they're doing in the future if there's one band out there that I feel like is just not getting enough hype and enough attention and enough respect right now it's Algiers because you know what they're doing is so incredibly creative and cutting-edge but I just feel like few people are kind of realizing that the new Billy woods album known unknowns which sort of slipped my mind for a second because I did a CO review of that album with Mike c-town very cryptic very dark and very sort of real like Billy woods is East Coast MC punchy er production on this thing than usual beats handled by blockhead from beginning to end on this thing love the beats of the beats love the beats Billy woods of course is as cryptic as ever on these instrumentals to me it's really kind of like a loners hip-hop album a Bohemians hip hop album maybe a little bit too abstract for your average person but you know me personally I'm sort of used to Billy with style at this point you know I love kind of not fully knowing or understanding what sort of the interest the interesting and vivid images that he's bringing up in a song are sort of what they're connected to or what exactly they mean but slowly kind of piecing those puzzle pieces together as I listen to his work again it's kind of what makes him special and interesting as an MC that he speaks in such coded and disjointed language a lot of the time and the more that I listen to it again the more beauties and the more sort of interesting intricacies reveal themselves about this record he's really sort of like a thinking man's emcee and he's an emcee that's really going to kind of not test your patience but he certainly requires patience you know I guess uh you know it's it's it's really sort of a the replay that kind of you will most likely find power in Billy woods music with and okay there we go I think that's everything I wanted to mention that I do kind of do these off the top of my head so it is good that I remembered all of those okay all right again all those albums down there in the description make sure to listen to them make sure to check them out and recommending them to you don't let them slip through the cracks and we are going to leave it at that great albums transition have you given these albums listen did you love them did you hate them what would you rate them you're the best you're

mFeDwNwEK7k,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is doing a quick little review of this new Nine Inch Nails EP this is the second EP Trent Reznor has released under the Nine Inch Nails name since adding Atticus Ross full time as sort of uh the second half of Nine Inch Nails because technically the band is just him and Atticus at the moment and I did love that EP that they dropped toward the very very very end of last year that was very low fives very rough around the edges it ended up on my loved list it was kind of like Trent Reznor throwing it back to the more aggressive and distorted in Wirt industrial days of Nine Inch Nails that was the not the actual events EP and now we have this add violence EP like more than a half a year later and this one is a bit of a sonic change a bit of a stylistic change it doesn't sound like Atticus is just simply playing a supportive role for Trent to go down memory lane on this new EP over here while there are elements of it that are kind of nostalgic it feels like at points it does have kind of a rigid synthetic sequence almost New Wave vibe to it that was a you know very much a prominent influence on like pretty hate machine you know but obviously a little bit more modern a little bit more sleek a little bit more punchy here on this EP you're sort of combining that with elements of the grand and somewhat atmospheric sort of soundtrack work that Atticus Ross is known for when he worked with Trent Reznor on like the social-network soundtrack and the with the Dragon Tattoo soundtrack so it's kind of like those two worlds colliding in a way the intro track as I stated in a previous best/worst track segments is a decent tune I like the the groove on that track I like some of the sequence electronics on there it does feel like an interesting musical throwback to the 80s in a way but you know there's something about the songwriting it's just not one of Trent's best tunes it just kind of feels like your average 90's alt rock tune at its very core and I felt like if the duo had continued from the they're down that road maybe we would get a few solid numbers sort of in that vein but in fact things get even more emotional and somber and space here as the EP continues along and while I do like a lot of the textures and I do like a lot of the sounds and the vibes and the moods that sort of come out of these tracks it's very dreary it's very despondent occasionally beautiful it just doesn't feel like Trent and Atticus are penning the best tunes here especially for the next two tracks the lovers and this is the place on the fourth cut of the EP I feel like Trent and Atticus do you really get their together for an exciting track that has a really climactic distorted sort of over barring but you know a really powerful exciting way ending that sort of gets more and more chaotic and and dense as it goes along like this Cup for me is as amazing as anything on the not the actual events EP and actually could have maybe fit pretty snugly onto that EP like would have felt very at home shoulder to shoulder with the material on that thing but then I feel like things fall off once again with the closer which I kind of had my mouth watering for because it's like an 11 minute track I felt like Trent and Atticus would really pull out all the stops on this thing but yet again it just ends up being about his average a tune as the opening cut and then the song reaches a point where this beat this riff this groove that they hit upon just repeats and repeats and repeats until the song ends as more and more distortion is sort of added to this sound wave and it just sort of crushes it and crushes it and crushes it until it's like this gurgling sort of all like garbled mess and this kind of sonic experimentation I'm usually very into it it's usually pretty stimulating for me but it just didn't feel that abrasive it just didn't feel that destructive after a while sort of the degradation of the sound of the track just became kind of predictable and it's like okay and kind of here where this is going you know by two minutes into it and then by the time it was just like this completely distorted mess it was like all right I guess where I guess we're here now um the EP is okay you know it's nowhere near as well-written or as exciting or as catchy or as punchy as the not the actual events EP a few interesting and very dreary textures pulled up it's very moody you know if you enjoy Trent Reznor's more recent and more moody material maybe this EP will speak to you a little bit more but you know there are obviously some spots like the lovers that is obviously just like it could have used a little bit more writing could have used a little bit more structure could have used a little bit more melody and the closing track here too we're sort of again embarks on its sonic experiment that really doesn't pan out and doesn't stay interesting for its own duration and I have to if I had to throw anything on this again because there will be people piss off in the comments I could say I feel like a like a decent six on this thing it's decent it's okay I'm not nuts about it there are a couple tracks on here that I think are pretty good and you know certainly nothing on here that leaves me feeling like hey I'm so much less enthusiastic about Nine Inch Nails now I mean actually you know at least some of the material here and still that previous EP does have me wondering where this is going but you know this is definitely not as mind-blowing to me or as a blood pumping to me as you know not the actual events and we will leave it at that thank you very much for watching over here next to my head when we hit that transition there is the thing that you can go check out over there which is the review of Nine Inch Nails not the actual events EP and I'll catch you guys in the next video you're the best well if you forever 
QqwXu96_ZNc,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is doing a really quick quickie raw review of the new dizzee rascal album Rask it dizzee rascal if you didn't know you should know is a really prominent grime artist over in the UK one of the most significant artists in that genre in the United Kingdom and you know he's come out with a couple of great records under his belt a while ago like last decade it in my opinion he's yet to really come through with like as amazing an album as his debut but he has this new record over here I didn't see it get a lot of positive reception and grime has been seeing like a little bit of a resurgence recently like a lot of good grime records or at least grime records that have received a pretty high profile over here in the US have been getting release over the past couple of years and it sort of gives me hope that Dizzee Rascal can finally just find the I guess the patience and the focus to deliver a very consistent and a true-blue grime record that is really truly no-nonsense finally you know like like he had in the past now there's sort of this interest in grime once again that there's kind of this revitalized demand and passion for the genre and certainly that's how Raska starts out I mean the first 8 tracks on this thing there are a couple of concessions for more American audiences like obviously notes in his flow or in the production that to me read as something that a more American audience would digest a bit easier but still like grime fans you know pure grime fans you really have no qualms with the the first 8 tracks of this thing you know it's a great run it's a fantastic run awesome flows descriptive lyrics that dive deeply into grime culture now that it's been around so long there's so much for a guy like Dizzee Rascal to bring up and rap about and of course given his voice and given his style you know he is delivery his performances are still so unique are still so bold still have a very character to them but as soon as we hit sort of the midpoint of the record we're hitting track nine we're getting a bit of a flow change and a production change and a stylistic change you know the first beat the hit me was like man this sounds like DJ mustard would have produced it or something so at least something out of the Bay Area or whatever and then from there we're getting all these pop rap songs these love tracks so I don't really think like dizzy does all that well or sort of pulls off all that well the obnoxious sick of this track which is a kind of a weird lyrical conceptual gimmick that gets annoying before the song has even finished like a really terrible pop rap ballad with a guest singer like I'm a second to last track the the second half of the album really truly does turn into a mess and I'm just not really sure what to say about this album beyond that it's really just kind of like a tale of two albums like you have your hard-nosed hard-hitting fantastic grime you know amazing adrenaline pumping cuts for the first portion of the record and then when you reach that midpoint it starts to wane a little bit he starts to dabble in some instrumentals and stuff that you did I'm kind of questioning I'm kind of like really you know is this really the best direction to sort of take it in right now is he really playing to his strengths hopefully you know he can go back to a sound like in the first portion of the record toward the end of the album and sort of stick the landing for the very finish of the record but no it actually just kind of gets worse and worse and worse and devolves further and further and further and that's really all I have to say that if I had to put a score on it because I know that people are going to chew my goddamn head off if if I don't put some kind of stupid number on this thing down in the comments if I had to put a score on it I would say you know it's a light six or something overall it's decent when you sort of average out all of the tracks because you know there's more palatable material in the second half then there is absolutely terrible material in the second half and the bulk of the first leg of the album is great but you know overall as an experience it's just kind of so-so you know and I think I'm just going to just going to have to leave it at that dizzee rascal Rask it forever 
0fgpP3u_sUs,hi everyone Anthony fan tanno here the the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of not one but two albums new records from Shabazz Palaces quasars born on a gangster star in quasars versus the jealous machines Shabazz Palaces if you didn't know is a seattle-based experimental and abstract hip-hop outfit fronted and spearheaded by Ishmael Butler MC producer formerly of the group big about planets but under the Shabazz Palaces name in my opinion he's responsible for one of the best hip-hop records of the decade black up a record that really puts Shabazz Palaces on the map and for good reason in my opinion there wasn't a single thing about this album that was refreshing cutting-edge as well as innovative there were tons of strange sound escapes on this thing punctuated with groovy loose beats stretched samples and rapping that was cool it was laid-back it was calm it was collected but still really engaging and thoughtful Riddle like very socially aware and lots of cultural satire packed into Ishmael Butler aka Pallas ear Lazaro's aka butterflies lyrics on this thing so given how great that album was there was really no reason in my opinion not to be excited for whatever Shabazz Palaces was going to bring next that would be their record Lilith in majesty in 2014 but honestly in my opinion this record felt like a more aimless version of its predecessor more watered down Messier especially with all of its disconnected songs that didn't really build on top of one another all of its unnecessary interludes it just felt like Shabazz Palaces didn't continue to grow what made the project so interesting in the first place instead deconstructing all of those elements and for what I don't know so now Shabazz Palaces is back and not just with one record but two sister albums and the book this was even a tougher listen than the group's sophomore record I honestly don't know where to start I mean for one the material that's here did really need to be spread across two disks I mean there's really only one decent disk of material on this thing I mean not only is there just not enough worthwhile music to pack both of these albums but the narratives and concepts that allegedly fuel both of these records they're barely there strung together by a thread borne on a gangster star is supposedly supposed to be like this introduction almost a character portrait of this quasars figure meanwhile the second of these two albums is supposed to be sort of a narrative playing out featuring this character yet born on a gangster star barely delivers much in the way of I don't know a modus operandi I just kind of feel like I'm listening to calcio Lazaro rap overproduction that's slightly more space centric than usual it's almost like the space concept is being used to do as little as possible on the Sonics side just as long as there's like sort of open gaps and the sounds in every direction it's it's space that must be why the sense don't really sound that interesting that must be why the beats are so stiff or lifeless or open or non-existent I mean this thing is so indulgent and so difficult at points it makes Shabazz Palaces past two projects sound like pop rap albums and not to say the group has delivered something super challenging or super dense or super intricate here that's just difficult to untangle it's the exact opposite there's just so little going on of interest the instrumentals especially on born on a gangster star are just not really that vibrant they're not that colorful they're not that interesting the inventive adventurous production of black up and to a lesser extent the follow-up record are just not here and honestly diving into the lyrics on this thing I don't feel like I'm listening to the musings of this newly minted character created specifically for this record I just kind of feel like I'm listening to Ishmael Butler give his usual opinions on the usual topics that I have come to expect him to usually approach on a Shabazz Palaces album he's essentially playing himself over a series of very inconsistent and disjointed tracks a couple of which are like mostly instrumental and almost horrendous with just how awkwardly and clunk aliy the sounds come together there's just so little in the way of gratifying materially or especially on this album the next record however I think is a little more uniform the sound of it is a bit more envelope it's kind of easier for me to get lost in this record even though it is very sparse there isn't a whole lot in the way of colorful interesting production in my opinion but it does have a vibe it does have a strong aesthetic to it that is continually delivered throughout the entire project but honestly when I get into the substance of the record especially the lyrics I'm not really getting a lot especially considering there's like supposed to be a narrative to this thing I mean there are numerous moments on this record where Ishmael sort of makes these overt pop-culture references like on the track love in the time of Kanye and while these pop-culture references especially hip-hop references continually come up it's like the the record and the attitude of Shabazz Palaces are just too highfalutin to say anything really down to earth or obviously critical at least not in a way that doesn't come off super judgemental which this attitude is nothing new for Shabazz Palaces it's just that that attitude that pretentiousness that Pappa sness is really all we have here with the music and some of the bars and the refrains on here being so lackluster it's almost like in my opinion that there's really no reason for Shabazz Palaces to bring this attitude considering how subpar the material is on this thing I mean honestly as dumb as some Mego songs may be I'd rather listen to me goes you know then bleep bleep bloop bloop bleep bleep bloop what came first the rapper or the trap honestly I feel like I'm listening to the lost musical transmission of like a bunch of old heads who started a space colony and just like who they zapped off like you know a galaxy or two away for a thousand years and this would be the music that they make they're all on like the starch wreck ship in a dark room and like a circle wearing shiny capes there in the middle of some kind of telekinesis mind-meld and they're just listening to these really Spacey just lifeless beats and just a that ain't cool that ain't cool it's like this ancient race of like after a futuristic space aliens with advanced technology came down to earth and we're like we have something really important to tell you and then we're all gathered and we're listening what they're about to say and then they just go on this like long rant about how they're born in the wrong generation because it's not like these two albums are really saying anything all that poignant at least not anything that wasn't said on the past two records with more interesting production I might add because most of the time I feel like these two discs are just being abstract for the sake of being abstract and that's it sure the tone of the instrumentals and the lyrics kind of create this otherworldly feel but this other world isn't that different from Earth and it's mostly barren to give these albums credit occasionally there are some really interesting and lovely love poems spit over these very sparse beats that are kind of nice sometimes on these two discs I do hit tracks and I do his spots that feel like that old Shabazz Palaces spark kind of coming back like when cat's claw shine alight with saddle AK was pretty good even though I thought the somewhat jazzy sample on the instrumental let the beat feeling kind of plain the song 30 clip extension might be my favorite song in the entirety of these two discs a feminist I thought was a great track once I kind of got more into the vibe of the record that also goes for the song Atlantis the song Julian's dream to most of the love songs on the second disc actually but even though jealous machines might be better than gangster star it's still a very flawed project I mean so many potholes so many lackluster moments so many dreadfully boring moments I mean the closing track on this thing sounds like Space Age mumble rap with Ishmael Butler spinning over what sounds like distance space farts I wish I was joking there's like these distant I have no idea what it is not to mention you have bars on this thing like feudalist guilds upload holy wars for a fascist jihad with hashtags which might sound like your average sort of best Palaces bar but I don't know it just seems so ridiculous the imagery and the futuristic sort of descriptions don't really have the same Flair as they have in the past and I don't know man I'm just shocked that Shabazz Palaces has turned into this incredibly one-dimensional and very predictable project despite when they debuted it was like the most cutting-edge thing of the year um I'm feeling a strong three on gangster star and I have to give a like five - jealous machines just really underwhelmed by both projects unfortunately and I'm just going to leave it at that transition have you given these albums a listen did you love and ajaita what would you rate them you're the best you're the best which should I agree next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're angry over here next to my head is a review of black up that you should check out because that album is fantastic or you know click the link to subscribe to the channel alright I'll catch you guys in the next review for ever [Music] 
fSfLoZ-L2gQ,[Music] hi everyone a cousin is ooh Tana your Internet's busiest music nerd makes my lips a chi and it's time for a review of the new integrity album howling for the nightmare shall consume legendary underground cleveland metalcore band integrity back with a brand new album they have come out with so much material over the years they've been added since like the late 80s although this is their first release to my knowledge on the metal institution known as relapse records and it's kind of interesting to hear them on this label given that in the past integrity has found themselves more often than not on labels that have more of a punk ethos to them Death Wish Victory Records a 389 but I think it's all kind of indicative of the direction the band is going in on this album the band's hardcore punk roots don't so much dominate and dictate the songwriting and performances on this album this is truly integrities heaviest and most dynamic and most patient and most metal album so far the band's Punk aggression is still here on a lot of the tracks but not to the same primal cro-magnon intensity as their past work especially systems overload or humanity is the devil this album doesn't even center around the chunky brutal heavy mid-2000s metalcore riffs that dominated their to die for album a record that I love but it kind of stands out like a sore thumb in their discography because instantly they went on to drop a series of albums that were way more rough around the edges more frenzied chaotic but also darker and more experimental to howling for The Nightmare shall consume is a different beast though the production is heavier it's clear the performances seem more decisive and just more measured but still at their core integrity is still very much a metalcore band I wouldn't say this album is like a huge disappointing departure in the way that like integrity 2000 was it's just that on this album the band finds themselves dabbling in a variety of metal style some old school some more contemporary and they just kind of apply their signature guitar and vocal work to all of them like for one it should be plainly obvious that the song blood sermon is some kind of black metal tribute with its constant blast beats and tremolo Pickett ARS their cuts on here where some of the riffs take on more of a heavy metal feel or a thrash II feel or indulge in maybe even like a little bit of Motorhead worship which the band pulls off pretty well given that tweed hellions lead vocals occasionally sound like I'm listening to Lemmy if he had been transported from like the Paleolithic era and there are at least several cuts on this record where the band takes things kind of mid-paced even slow very heavy almost sludgy with an emphasis on these large patient riffs and throwing these soaring anthemic guitar leads and solos on top and this is not the first time the band has experimented with slow more subtle instrumentation of the song before the world was young comes to mind but integrity really goes the distance on these tracks with a lot of songs on this thing like stretching out around the seven-minute mark and all them build up to essentially a 48 minute album and that's not even counting the 10 additional minutes of bonus tracks on this thing the band is really trying to write like a little bit of an epic of sorts on this record while simultaneously not really sticking to their usual sound I've never heard a band that simultaneously felt like they were trying their hardest but also were beyond giving a and while I do admire the attempt a good chunk of it though I am a little unfazed by it because unfortunately while I have enjoyed some longer integrity tracks in the past I don't think the band really has the finesse to keep these sorts of songs interesting for as long as they draw them out here and for as many as they deliver on this thing with the exception of the song seven Reese Muse though that track is definitely the most experimental of the bunch and features all these are gravelly dark spoken word passages a very melodic and climactic finish but honestly the slow guitar riff and soaring guitar solo combo only works for so long on this album especially with the bad approaching it in such a shallow way and the vocals which a lot of the time are just like this angry atonal grunting do get kind of tedious after a while as I was listening to some of these tracks I was just kind of wishing like man I I really would like to hear maybe what Scott Kelley of neurosis would do over this track or like Matt Pike of high on fire would do over this track which is kind of weird because they're not even super dynamic vocalists I mean they're kind of similar in their guttural sort of tone but I know they would have found a way to sing more sensibly over these riffs don't get me wrong I think hellions vocals work really well over the sonic mayhem of integrity x' recent work their old stuff too but without all cylinders sort of firing underneath his voice on a lot of these instrumentals it just kind of seems like he's screaming into an abyss that he's not really getting much out of because when his singing is placed over the driving heavy metal riffs of die with your boots on like the performance just everything about that track is so much more gratifying it's adrenaline pumping it's blood boiling the points on this record where the band was really sticking to their guns is essentially where it worked the most for me with a few notable exceptions like string up my teeth which might be my favorite cut on the entire record and is going to stick out to any listener of this album for the mere fact that suddenly the band breaks into this sort of hardrock groove over the chorus which features these female backup singers that are belting out this little vocal line over the bands of guitar work it's just so weird it's so kooky but it just makes the song you know overall there are more highlights and lowlights on this record some of the Bands slower more subtle experiments more sludgy experiments on this record I don't think they all pan out or at least they don't all stay exciting throughout but I do think the clear performances and the heavier punchy er production does the band and their sound a lot of justice it's also cool to hear integrity dabbling in so many styles of metal so effectively if you're looking for a grimy aggressive monstrously dark and very diverse metal record with a very strong idiosyncratic vocal sort of character to it I would give this thing a try definitely give it a recommendation I'm feeling a decent too strong seven this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would your rating

5YF9p9ywoF8,hi everyone surprised tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Lana Del Rey album lust for life this is the latest record from California crooner Lana Del Rey who for the first time on an album of hers is is shown is depicted beaming smiling scaring the viewer directly in the eyes not just like you know looking really uh you know uh blankly in the distance while just like whoo sexy Lana Del Rey really needs an introduction at this point on her fifth album it has been a very weird and a very rocky road to get where she's at today her sudden thrust into the spotlight with singles like video games her botched SNL debut her artistic evolution from her breakout album born to die to 2015's honeymoon which I found to be surprisingly impressive at points Lana finally embracing the vintage pop and rock sounds that have always inspired her with an instrumental backdrop that was a little more truer to the time period and then I was kind of surprised to hear a lot of lyrically take a bit more of a dominant role on the narratives of some of these tracks rather than just being some kind of submissive damsel to whatever bad boy crosses her path honeymoon was not a perfect album far from a perfect album but it smelled like progress to me and had me kind of excited to hear whatever Lana was going to do next but it was hard to kind of maintain that excitement given some of the teaser tracks for this new record over here the song Coachella Woodstock in my mind which I thought was going to be some kind of throwaway non-album track just because of how terrible it was know this song is on the album and it's hilarious even before the song starts just because of the title and the song got even funnier once I actually heard the lyrics to this thing which essentially reveals a really weak attempt at trying to make a somewhat political statement the sentiment of the song essentially boils down to her worrying about all the kids at Coachella because the the world is just so crazy right now all these kids that have been money to throw away on a really expensive music festival I'm really worried about him I'm worried about their children's children it's a really shallow statement a really hollow sentiment I mean there are thousands and thousands of people who are on the verge of losing their health care 90% of the casualties of our drone strikes are innocent people as our own government has documented we're in the middle of a really disgusting drug war like it just seems like a lack of priorities like oh no things are getting so bad we have to worry about people who don't really have that much to worry about oh oh oh not to mention the trap style percussion on this track and really murky synthesizers didn't really seem to complement Lana's musical and singing style all that much I mean I know this sound is really in vogue right now but that doesn't necessarily mean it does Lana any justice so of course it was unfortunate to also hear these really prominent and synthetic and very sequence somewhat rickety beats on other tracks here like on the single groupie love and I do like the very swaying whimsical gauzy chorus of this cut but be back to back ASAP rocky features placed here and on the song before it are kind of unnecessary which is why I'm curious as to why the song summer bummer just was not cut like it's not that great of a song a lot of sounds like a feature on her own track once the rap verses get started the track features these horrendous Travis Scott inspired like little auto-tune embellishments in the background that are ugly and again it just seems like the further Lana goes down the trap road the more awkward and the more out of place this music and this record sounds I'm even more confused considering that the record has 16 tracks at 72 minutes long which is just a smidge longer than honeymoon but Jesus there are at least a couple of tracks here that could have hit the cutting room floor and it would have made the album better like on the anemic white Mustang which ends abruptly has a kind of weak structure and features this ridiculous whistling that does not sound all that great in the track sticks out like a sore thumb and we're extent even for Lana's standards are kind of silly but I'm kind of getting ahead of myself here because despite the fact that there were some misleading and some unlikable singles going into this record for the most part a lot of kind of sticks to her guns here and builds on the lavish and the somewhat vintage instrumentation that made up the bulk of her last album especially toward the end of the album like on heroin and change and beautiful people beautiful problems and the get free track where Lana seems to embrace the sound of sixties girl groups which have always inspired her but she's never kind of really hugged it tight and sort of executed it and as Pepe away as she does here and honestly it's one of my favorite tracks she's ever laid down onto a record and actually the starter track loved on this thing while it did kind of underwhelmed me when I initially heard the single in the context of the record I do like it quite a bit it's a pretty solid song and it just seems like a lot of standing on an even grander platform of instrumentation this time around what just ends up making this album feel kind of awkward is hearing Lata try to reconcile the musical and cultural worlds that collide on this thing you're talking about an album that features both playboy cardi and Stevie Nicks and boasts production credits from both Sean Lennon and Metro boomin never have Lana's new school and old school influences sounded more at odds on a single album which is odd because I felt like they came together so harmoniously on born to die even though a lot of the songs on that record in my opinion worked awful I did give that album credit for kind of melding this grand orchestral instrumentation with you know these subtle notes of hip hop production now unless for life they're not really gelling all that well case in point the song cherry which features these really weird drum machine fills that just kind of click and Twitter away against Lana's Moaning vocals on the chorus they're kind of interrupting and just sound out of place ridiculous which is a shame because I feel like this is one of the decent Tunes that the album has to offer lust for life just continually delivers these really weird production choices many of which feel like they're just added into the album to give it more of a contemporary Flair like oh here it sounds really old but wait here's something that sounds kind of new most of the time on this album I just wish Lana would embrace her old soul tendencies and just simply stick to that I mean the opening lyrics of this record already acknowledged the fact that Lana is law into kind of this new world old world Time Warp why try to fix what's not broken there are some moments on this thing where I think the present is more effectively worked into the past I mean the more I listen to it the more that the duet Lana does with the weekend on this project grew on me with all the glimmering background instrumentation it's kind of fireworks Abel's voice did sound a little out of place with this backing instrumentation but I do think that once he and Lada came together it worked I dug the collab even if there are times when I think the lyrics could have been better or I was a little turned off because Lana had to put on her you know phone sex operator voice and I just don't get why once Abel starts singing on the track you can hear these like ever so subtle and super faint twittering trap style high hats in the background they're there and I don't know why they're so quiet they don't even need to be there but it's like we just need to add them there because that's it's it's contemporary its new there's some other risks Lana takes on this record like it seems like she's making a greater effort to color the background of these tracks with like a little vocal improvisation here and there where she's just reaching into her upper register and you know pulling off these these vocal riffs where she's put a little stank on it Carla stay away or on the song in my feelings where she kind of sounds like at one point like a squeaky breathy Kate Bush singing while being violently shaken after taking too many caffeine pills but you know a good chunk of this album is the usual Lana that we have come to know and and love or not love depending on your opinion but I will say slightly improved but for the most part the same strengths and weaknesses the sort of flat emotional delivery using moodiness as a crutch the limited lyrical scope I mean lyrics that I have to kind of suspend all standards for or else I'm just going to you know have my eyes rolling in that I don't we're just beautiful people with beautiful problems please don't stop the only thing that makes that very bitter pill worth swallowing is the Stevie Nicks performance on that track which is actually really good I like the inclusion of this feature a lot because it actually says a lot about Lana's sing because Stevie seemed to be such a huge influence on her though I guess the downside of this is when they try to harmonize on the chorus I feel like I'm listening to Stevie Nicks and Stevie Nicks impersonator on the same cut still though I do like the introduction of the track I do like Lana and Stevie singing separately on this song and I do think it's one of the better Tunes on the project and I know I'm being really negative on this album but for the most part it's because I think they were really obvious improvements that could have been made to this record and this album had more potential than was actually capitalized on and that's not to say that there aren't great tracks that's not to say that there aren't highlights it's just that the album is kind of front-loaded and very back loaded I think God Bless America and all the beautiful women in it is one of the better tracks this album has to offer the kind of easygoing breakbeat in the background kind of reminds me of like a trip-hop song from the 90s while the gauzy instrumentation and Lana's vocals on top sounds like something out of a dream pop tune comes together very nicely and the lyrics I like to which are partly patriotic but also kind of a female empowerment anthem to the track is very lavish there's something almost watery and murky about it too like I'm being submerged into the instrumentation on this thing and oddly enough the song when the world was at war we kept dancing is kind of a political statement and one that I don't actually mind in the tracklist here it's far less silly than the Coachella track and it's actually kind of a bit of a meta-analysis of the bliss and ignorance that some of Wanda's fans might have found themselves in once they woke up and found themselves in trumps America after election day and once again on this track too we get very envelope invent oxic a ting very mystical instrumentation the Sean Lennon cut on this album is really gratifying as well as kind of steeped in a very subtle Beatles or especially with the chord progression at points reminding me of the song something from Abbey Road song heroine reaches a surprisingly emotional climax in the second half and on the song change we get a very somber and a very hush but a really interesting piano ballad which is a little more intimate than I would have typically expected Lata to go on an album every time and we don't know what it's for there are a lot of great moments on this record it's just that I feel like Lana needed to pair this album down to its truest highlights and cut out all of the production gimmicks that feel like they were just added in there to make the record feel more current because honestly there's already enough of Lana in the present to make the music have this kind of natural anachronism to it already there's really no need to force it with hideous production and unnecessary features when I look at the entire album I look at the entire tracklist despite my lack of enthusiasm for a good chunk of tracks in the first half I do actually like more songs than I dislike on this project like for the first time ever on a Lana album ever and I have to kind of admit that a lot of slightly outdid herself once again on an album and maybe this trend will hopefully continue into the future I'm feeling a light decent six on this thing transition have you given this album but listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review max hit the
