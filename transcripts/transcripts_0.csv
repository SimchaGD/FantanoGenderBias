0vFTfoOavRM,let's start let's begin hi everyone be thin again tahno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new perfume genius album set my heart on fire immediately this is a brand new full-length album from singer/songwriter Mike had rias AKA perfume genius who is kicking off this new decade with his v LP here i have been looking forward to doing this review all week because when i think back through the 2010s few songwriters came across as so consistently captivating as mike the sonic and musical transitions he underwent during this time were pretty radical as well going from the loaf i tiny dreary piano songs of learning to no shape in 2017 one of the most immaculately produced and lavish records of the 2010s personally i think it's a pretty big project to follow up but from the sound of set my heart on fire immediately mike doesn't seem to be sweating the task it seems like he's focusing on a lot of the key strengths from that very album and continuing to hone them and just dig gold out of them just like on no shape there is a wide breadth of musical styles and fusions embraced on this record showcasing everything from showy chamber pop to Romantic theatrical euro folk with a huge dose of woodwinds some of the stylistic transitions along this tracklist are so breakneck and even occur within the songs themselves the track described features the slow grungy heavy walls of guitar least with some twangy folk and country strings and just past the midpoint the song suddenly morphs into two full minutes of heavenly new-age ambience which is a pretty daring move for the second track on your record but as hard to predict as the tracklist on this record is mike approaches every sound with quite a bit of style and grace though there is the track leave that reminds me a lot of the song choir from no shape where Mike's muttered and somewhat hushed vocals ring like that of something on a shoo shoo song I suppose it is cool that this is a connection and an influence that Mike would like to keep maintaining in his music and I do like the whimsical grouping of woodwind and harp and strings the track also has a great subtly menacing quality to it but it still remains that I don't care for the stillness of the instrumental all that much and it is one of the weaker songs here still once again we do have Blake Mills on production on this record - who totally killed it on though shape kills it here as well every mix on this thing is so well balanced and creatively textured I would even say in a way there is more aesthetic ground covered on set my heart on fire immediately than there was on no shape because once again you do get those pristine beautiful immense and larger-than-life moments on the record like the intro track or even the very quiet Jason the baroque pop flavor on that song I think is just so wonderfully clean and just it's it's like watching a diamond with light shining through it light just pure light washing over me the beauty of the sound of this track but then you also have some dream on here whose hits of drums and cymbals and deep fried vocals are also blown out the growling guitar distortion that's so persistent on this track - it sounds like a Neutral Milk Hotel song so again there's a lot of ground covered on this record sonically texturally stylistically but mics very heart-wrenching songwriting style along with his shivering vibrato and an very expressive nasal vocal tone those are enough those are bold and you're grabbing enough to tie all of these songs together and make for a relatively cohesive listen and speaking of songwriting style it would seem on at least some of these tracks mike is going back a little bit to the simplicity and the basics of records like put your back into it maybe not stripping his songs down to the briefest of runtimes but still the very bare closer borrowed light reminds me of some old perfume genius stuff as well as one more try and whole life both of which have a bit of a 50s flair to them there are some standout moments in the tracklist that come off quite hooky or punchy the song nothing at all which I read as like an ode to anticlimax or just being someone who isn't unreasonably expecting too much of people or circumstances and learning to accept things as they are in a way and the song has the swag or heavy hook that reads like some old-school Springsteen I got what you won't babe I got what you need son nothing nothing at all meanwhile the track without you is a very refined and idyllic moment on the record that is surprisingly feel good for a perfume genius song sonically anyway the distance strings the dreamy leads the gently strummed acoustic guitars the really lustrous and beautiful instrumental flourishes once the two-word hook pops in we also have on the floor which is a pretty obvious callback to 80 synth pop anthems but the way it's produced it does not have a lick of nostalgia to it and I kind of love that it's somewhat vintage but yet aesthetically it sounds like any other perfume genius song from this era it's funny in that way but the one thing that stood out to me about this track the most were the lyrics the way Mike seems to be writing about a crush on this track and it's not coming off just like a crush but more like an obsession or an illness or an ailment asking in the hook how long till this washes away how long till my body is safe crossing the name out on the page it's dramatic so those are some of the catchy ER and more direct tracks on here not to skimp over the slow burners because they can be pretty fire as well the song moon bend I alluded to earlier as having that romantic folky instrumentation that is one of the most patient and theatrical songs I think mike has pulled together so far a really operatic quality to the drama in the vocals to love the sparse splashes of chords on this track how whispery and restrained Mike's voices it's like his his singing he just weeps like a raspy violin then the beds of folk instrumentation to come in on the second half which I again I think are pretty Eurocentric our breathtakingly gorgeous the track just a touch was a bit of a highlight for me as far as low-key songs on here go if not only for just the development of the vocals and some of the crescendos in the second half that run to me like something out of a Radiohead song be this though I'm not sure what to say outside of that I loved the vast majority of songs on this album I think in a way Mike has knocked it out of the park again though I did not find this project to be as much of a stunner as no shape was while I appreciate the adventure these songs presented I think having every track so vastly different in style and tone from one another made for a pretty disjointed listen and certainly there are cuts on here that I enjoyed the song at the core of them but I think they could have been rearranged instrumentally to be a bit more climactic like one more try just to add a just a touch more of drama I'm also not really crazy about the persistently Stern groove on your body changes everything it does give the song a good kickoff but as it just fails to alter or shift or evolve as the song progresses especially on the hook that lack of contrast leaves the track feeling flat that being said though I didn't really hate any of these songs and this is really just a matter of several tracks paling in comparison to the rest of the LP I still loved the album on the whole and it will still most likely go down as one of my favorite art pop records of the year feeling a light eight on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another song that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana perfume genius the forever

HRZcBNjlPQI,hi everyone lock the knee down Tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Charli XCX album how I'm feeling now this is a new quarantine album from UK pop singer and songwriter Charli XCX 2020 has been the most hellish year in recent memory and I think as music fans we should feel appreciative and grateful that some of our favourite artists even had the will to drop a song or a cover during this time much less an entire album that's especially true of Charli XCX who just dropped her futurist pop magnum opus Charli last year named it my album of the year as well it really was a project she could have coasted on for quite a while but instead she decided to take this negative situation we are all feeling the effects of to some degree and use it as an opportunity to make some special music the conditions under which you write or make something can have a huge impact on the outcome of that thing which is why I want to emphasize that this is not just some collection of songs and artist is passively releasing during this time of pandemic know how I'm feeling now is actually a reaction to these circumstances the influence of which bleeds into pretty much every aspect of this project yeah I know it's been crazy lately but I gotta tell you man I I'm so happy I'm here I would want to be locked up with anybody but you you're my son you're my moon you're my stars you're my blue sky you're my blue jay you're my blue I'm in need of a guy my god piggie gobble gobble gooble Abu God you're my blue blue bye blue boy bye blue bobaloo boo I love you buddy well just as an example we have the opening track pink diamond whose production is harsh a little crushing claustrophobic the sounds on this one really feel like they are closing in on you meanwhile Charlie lyrically and vocally sounds like a tiger pacing back and in a cage I just want to go real hard I just want to go real hard pink diamond in the dark it's that need to get it out get out that energy go hard find some kind of release but you can't every single night kind of feels the same days blending together I'm a pink diamond I need space meanwhile with the production the hits of distortion on this one how huge the kicks feel the melting synthesizers - it's this nightmarish digital mayhem that in some respects reminds me a little bit of Death Grips which was a comparison prior to listening to this record that annoyed me I was like how could this possibly sound like that but it's it's actually kind of close essentially this track is the soundtrack to being locked away in some sort of digital prison and you're thrashing about in their song why is the following forever is a lot sweeter on the ears but it still maintains a lot of those same tense sonic elements in the production it's a little overly compressed there are these whooshing shots of noise that play throughout different points of the song - so there's harshness to it there's bitterness there's bite that contrasts with just how pleasant - the year Charlie's lead vocals are I won't know is love you I love you forever even when we're not together even in the midst of the Bliss of this lovesick anthem there is a sense of longing as well charlie wishing that she was essentially existing in a different time which I think very much fits in with the quarantine vibe of this record I would say production wise so does the track clause which features an instrumental from none other than Dylan Brady of 100 x fame I think his sound is absolutely perfect for a project like this the booming bass the glitchy electronics the insane vocal manipulations thematically even though this is one of the sillier and lovey-dovey air tracks on the record the production still does kind of carry that confined quality to it it is just vacuum-sealed but simultaneously hulking crushing heavy which contrasts with Charlie's very sweet stupidly in love hooks of I like I like I like everything about you which has a weirdly robotic quality to them that I like a lot in a way it the repetitions of those I like I like I like I like feel almost as if they are a glitch in a robot or a program or a cyborg or an AI with the track seven years the themes of love continue but this time Charlie is reflecting on all of the years that have passed in the midst of this long term relationship that she's in it's not one of the hooky er songs here but lyrically I think it is one of the most personal and compelling on the record as Charlie expresses having experienced highs and lows in this relationship but now it has arrived ultimately to a good place so hard things we've been through could have fallen but we only grew so I made my house a home with you I'm right here and it feels brand-new I used to live inside a lie with you and now we're honest and it feels so good which is not just a wonderful expression of dedication and devotion but also the path that can come in a relationship when two people hit a rough patch or rough patches and they decide to work together on their problems and their differences for just a at a better tomorrow now the vibe the emotion the themes of this track contrasts heavily with that of the next song detonate which seems like Charlie painting herself in a more inconsistent light with these heavy synthetic manipulations on her voice even heavier than on many of the other tracks here that make her sound like she's not even herself she's expressing a lot of undependable 'ti on this track or at least unpredictability closing yourself off leaving someone feeling low and blue generally being untrustworthy and this is interestingly juxtaposed against a very cute and quaint low-key electro pop instrumental these moments of deep self analyzation and self realignment continue on to the next song enemy because I guess when you're in quarantine and you're locked up what else are you gonna do but this track is set to these very springy keys and synth bass that honestly sound like they are straight out of the 80s and the confessional tone of the writing on this one comes off as if Charlie is putting a therapy session to song there is actually even a spoken word brain on this track that is literally an audio snippet of Charlie having therapy session we hear Charlie considering her enemy to be her lover the person closest to her because she's keeping her enemies close and this person knows everything about her yes the track is pretty irrational and certainly crazy but these are crazy times we live in and it is actually very real how quickly your mind can turn yourself against some of the most important people in your life the last handful of songs though on this thing I think is where we begin to get a couple of duds I finally understand has easily one of the most underwhelming vocal performances most basic structures and plainest instrumentals on the entire record narrative Lee I do like that the track brings some sense of closure to these themes of mental anguish and self-hatred but I'm just not that crazy about the tune on top of it I think Charlie could have done better to put a bigger stamp on these issues if she were trying to tie them up at this point we also have party for you which is a kind of cute idea a lot of heartening lyrics a song essentially about throwing a party for somebody albe it with a presentation that is a very dreamy and idyllic it almost seems like a fantasy but the production rings is just very hollow and doesn't provide a very strong background for Charlie's rap song vocals but I can't help but laugh at the lyrics where Charlie is going on and on about partying on someone for sure that's uh not nearly as weird as maybe it comes off at first but when I was listening to this passively for my first time I thought she was saying she was partying on someone whatever either way I still do love the track see 2.0 which is essentially a sequel to click off of her last record but it's it's got a very strange sample heavy somewhat glitchy intro that lasts a long time it's an unorthodox song structure and then in the second half we have Charlie who is expressing love admiration but also just a she's missing her clique she misses her clique so bad you know the the quarantine is essentially getting in between her and her clique it's it's heartbreaking anthems is the stir-crazy banger that this project needed massive sound gigantic bee lyrics essentially about spending all day eating cereal watching TV crying missing your friends fucking but it's not enough what is this stuff if you can't go out and hear some anthems go out at night see New York etc etc etc all of that party girl shit that Charlie's always on about you know she is she needs that it's her soul it's her lifeblood but it's not just that you know there are some bars on this track that are obnoxiously real meaning partying and feeling the heat from other people's bodies in that public space and some of us it's a sensation we're not gonna feel it for a while that closeness to other people I think is a part of the human experience and and we're being deprived of that right now and I think Charlie in her own way reflects on that interestingly with the final cut visions we do get a great sense of closure to this record sonically and thematically the slowly swelling beds of synthesizers on this track and the driving beats honestly are pretty uplifting and feel like hope feel like light at the end of the tunnel rushing over you as we enter into a brighter future hopefully the song essentially comes off like the soundtrack to reimagining a better world with Charlie going on and on and on about pictures in her mind pictures in her mind but the very very very final moments of the song maybe that's her waking up out of this dream maybe it's things turning dark or uncertainty painting her mind and this fantasy that she's in the midst of because how dissonant and ugly the techno beats and since get at the very final moments of the song make me feel like oh maybe maybe the future we're heading to is not all that great I think this record is really good I think it's great obviously has its its limitations that have been instilled upon it by the conditions under which it was created it sonically is not nearly as vibrant as Charlie it is not nearly as multifaceted as many saw from that record as well the whole thing is under 40 minutes 11 tracks in total and so far I think it is the best music I have heard this year in terms of reflecting reflecting on this quarantine this pandemic this situation that we're currently in and the emotional and mental toll that it may be taking on many people feeling a light to decent ate on this one transition have you

LqBsfpdHXX0,number one baby number one album in the country baby oh-oh-oh-oh number one number one number one number one what you got see there hater it's fine I'm happy for him I'm glad people like his music no you're not no you don't you're a hater you hate them Neve stays waiting hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new future album high off life this is a new full-length LP from rapper and auto Craner future at this point while the hype and acclaim around future's music may not be as large as it was in 2015 and 2017 his status is still legendary as a pioneer of this ever-evolving brand of psychedelic vibe doubt drugged-out auto-tuned trap while I've never been a big future fan up until this point I will say his last project the wizard that he put out last year is my favorite of his so far some of his eccentric inflections and flows combined with the more ambitious production and be switches on this thing make it a slight standout in futures discography I essentially hoped that upward trend would continue on to high off life which is a pretty funny title knowing futures past knowing his lyrical content though I can't say I went into this thing expecting a huge change in narrative or attitude as lyrically high off life has more trappin dealin and stackin than you could ever want some production from familiar faces as well like wheezy and tm88 also south side and take Keith and overall this project rounds pretty much all the bases that you would want a new future mixtape or album to round so there's honestly no reason that future shouldn't be totally in his element on this record and dropping his best stuff jest nothing but heat one track after the next so since that is the case why does high off life have some of futures worst stuff on it since Hendrix granted the album does start pretty strong with the opener trapped in the Sun the ghostly Airy court progressions hanging in the background of the instrumental are eerie as hell futures expressive and slurred kroons throughout the verses are a total vibe futures refrains on the track or catchy as hell - which is not only a bit of an earworm but also displays the duality of the lifestyle that future is always rapping about I guess I also find futures flows on high tech really catchy as well they are given a very stark presentation over this incredibly simple instrumental he sounds cold-blooded as hell on that track there is also a decent amount of vocal chemistry between him and Travis Scott on the track solitaires a coronavirus bar - but it doesn't take long for the stinkers to start rolling in to the tracklist hear that in songs that are essentially so formulaic so by the numbers so wash rinse repeat for future they go in one ear out the other they add pretty much nothing to the future cannon songs like touch the sky ride in strikers there is really nothing for me to report to you on with these songs outside of like in Andre the Giant bar and a totally forced nonsensical be switch into a passage that actually sounds better than the first leg of the song then from here things begin to spiral downward the track one of my is so understated repetitive and awkward it's mind-numbing not only that but the production on this one is kind of absolutely trash the sub-base hits on this beat sound almost randomly generated a little meanwhile are they even in tune with the total mess of keys just like on top of each other in the background so faintly that you can barely make them out anyway like this future even carries rapping over at this point meanwhile with hard to choose one this track is so redundant and structuralist the moment you've heard maybe the first thirty Seconds to a minute of it you've you pretty much know what's going on for the next two minutes I mean while I don't so much mind and sometimes I enjoy futures repetitive tracks when they are a bit more hype or aggressive this is not one of them I we'll truly honestly never quite get comatose future which this song is definitely an example of and just literally does nothing for me in total there aren't too many features on this future project but still some of them did manage to be disappointing the track featuring young boy never broke again seemed like a contest between him and future to see who could I guess strain their voice the hardest singing sort of out of their range immediately after this we had the track Harlem shake featuring young thug which is something I was excited for young thug in a future tracklist is usually a pick-me-up but what the is this is this even young thug it does not sound like young thug none of the vocal acrobatics or dynamics or expressiveness personality that you expect in a young thug verses here for the most part it is just very one-dimensional almost monotone it doesn't sound like him did he have a cold this day is he struck with the corona the aaaa ad-lib is pretty generic the flow is boring the verse itself is is painfully short he's barely on beat for a few bars uh no no thanks no thanks to this it is refreshing though to hear future go out on a limb with a few introspective tracks up the river as well as pray for a key the production on both tracks might be a little generic but still and at least futures writing does convey a real sense of tragedy specifically on key where he contrasts the lifestyle of a drug dealer against the success in the music world he is made today with a bit of a religious twist but sadly there's no real momentum built up past these tracks we are welcomed to a very very very mixed last leg past this point the song all bad is a true-blue banger featuring little Aussie vert that is very cynthy it's very hype in fact it kind of sounds like a little Aussie vert song just featuring future and even though that is the case and it sounds a little uncharacteristically zippy for a future record it's still nice to hear things energized a little bit in the tracklist then we have 100 shooters which is firing on all cylinders with quality features from Meek Mill Doughboy even future seems to be at the top of his game here he certainly saved one of the best for last on this one we also hear future getting introspective once more on the track accepting my flaws where I think of all the personal tracks on this record this is the most passionately delivered and performed but simultaneously the tracks on this thing that should be embarrassing continue to roll out as well like with too comfortable is future singing on the song even in tune with the instrumental in the background I don't think so although I can't totally blame him because this is a horrendous instrumental that samples like some really bad bits of banjo if it's not banjo I can't tell you what it is it sounds legitimately terrible and I guess if I was future I would I would ignore that and just focus on the beat but again your future nobody's forcing you to rap over these instrumentals find a better instrumental Jesus we also get once again that disgustingly lazy life is good track featuring Drake which at the time it was released it sounded like half of an unfinished future song and half of an unfinished Drake song to slam together into one nonsensical pointless track it's pretty much still that meanwhile last name and tycoon really bring nothing to this tracklist that other previously mediocre songs didn't already for sure there are highlights on this 70 minute record but a vast majority of what's here could have been left on the cutting room floor or could have been redone after the wizard I just don't get this sudden drop in quality here future his debut album isn't even ten years old at this point there's no reason that he shouldn't still be experimenting evolving and putting out his best stuff but instead he's just running off with the fumes of copying and pasting a bunch of ideas that he helped popularize years ago feeling a decent two strong three on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best

rOR1lpNnBJ0,hi hi hi hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd I hope you are doing well and it is time for another installment of our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the worst and the best tracks of the week they are linked down below of course like usual let's go over these tracks shall we of course I want to give a shout out to our turntable lab link down in the description box our patreon link down there as well if you want to use that to get some extra bonus monthly content and support us and everything we do in the process that turntable lab link we get kicked back from if you want to buy some vinyl of some stuff we have reviewed on the channel as well and now let's get right into the worst tracks of the week we have a handful over here but BAM one we have partynextdoor crossing over with trippy red on a track called excitement which i think is a bit of a miss title it should have been titled the excrement not excitement excrement not excitement because the vocals are terrible and it's dreadfully boring it's like the worst aspects of trippy and partynextdoor coming together on a one track please moving out from there Noah Cyrus sounding like a cheap knockoff of her sister on this track young and sad very sad to say the least moving on from there Metallica has come through I I mean I guess as a response to the whole pandemic thing with a 2020 version of blackened that they did from home doesn't sound that great so far less superior version of the track but hey if you're a die-hard fan that just wants to hear a bit of a new take with with much weaker production and a sound that has far less bite than the original sure why not and we also have a new track from Jonas Brothers over here ex featuring Carol G and the vocals on it our trash God the singing is bad on this one it's it's actually excruciatingly ly bad like that it's so pitchy and so nasally it's really unflattering like vocally one of the most unflattering Jonas Brother songs ever but and finally we have a track from future over here featuring young boy never broke again trillionaire not going to talk too much about this one as I am going to review future's new project this week so I'm not not really gonna you know get get too deeply into it alright let's move on to the tracks that I thought were meh worth shouting out worth pointing in your direction you might like them more than I did one we have a track over here from town to get down stay down I mean which is a 10 Tao has been around making music for a long time in the indie scene and and I think over the years has not really gotten her flowers I mean I can't proclaim to be a fan or anything like that my significant other is into the record you know the new record a little bit and I do like the vocals on it vocally I think one of the most interesting Tower Records so far as far as like indie goes I think a lot of the instrumentals are pretty boilerplate and very so-so but I recommend this track over here for sure pure cinema you know it's got a good hook I just wish again instrumentally it was a bit more ambitious and adventurous alright moving on from there little skies riot while it was not blown away by this track I will say I think this is one of the catch your little skies tracks I've ever heard I mean the flow is like really captivating right away you know really quick head Bob on this one and I'm liking the energy I'm liking the charisma on this track I think this is one of Sky's more charismatic tracks too so I don't know hopefully we're on an upward trajectory here we also have this track from Polo G beautiful pain losing my mind not sure if I'm going to cover this new record this week I guess we'll see although as of right now I don't feel shy about throwing maybe some of my general thoughts out here on the record while I do appreciate and I do like that poll og does a really good job lyrically and vocally kind of conveying the tragedy and pain of his life and his just general experiences into song I think um I I think I think a lot of the singing and vocal deliveries on the record are weak I think the production much of the time is so-so again when it comes to substance and emotional potency I think he is a cut above quite a few rappers out there who might kind of be working with a similar sound but I I think the the vocals and just beats are gonna have to be a lot better if this is gonna be like you know a total knockout in my view moving out from there yung lean acid at 7:11 some cool weird trippy qualities to this track over here I'll talk more about it and more about other tracks as I cover this one this week I think I may but I didn't really care for how redundant it was I feel like it has some cool moments it has some cool ideas but yung lean really kind of drove them into the ground and just beat them like a dead horse mercilessly to the point where anything redeeming about this track became stale by the end of it so I don't know moving on from there Katy Perry I think comes through with one of her most soso singles in a while I think that the ending is pretty intense and explosive and the vocal performance and that leg as well is very good about a lot of the verses on this track are completely forgettable and bland and tasteless and really lacking and in terms of a strong melody the chorus is is much better but I feel like the track doesn't really kind of wow until uh its final moments daisies is the name of the song obviously and I don't know I think Katy Perry has been on a somewhat weak string of singles as of late I hope that this is not addictive of a bad album coming around the corner we also have Joyner Lucas and Will Smith it's track over a year this remix of Joyner Lucas's will you know I'm not gonna hate it's it's cute that they linked up it's cute that they attack you that they got together and made a thing of it I appreciate it for what it is I don't hate it it is corny yes it is Corning it's very corny but it's heartwarming it's heartwarming as well moving on from there we have a new track from everything everything is well while this one was not as bad as their last as that is their last track it's it's still kind of a weird quirky piece of pop that I think isn't really kind of playing to the band's strengths yeah I guess I'll just leave it at that all right we have a couple of tracks from Brock Hampton as well that has just dropped excuse me mo be and then twisted featuring Ryan Beatty and Christian Alexander a lot of the same downsides as the other recent cuts like could have been structured better a little rough around the edges but simultaneously some cool daring ideas here and there I like the southern hip hop influences on mo B and some of the gang vocals on there although twisted I felt was pretty underwhelming generally from front to back but I think with better production and better vocal layering it could have been more beautiful and engaging and we have a track over a year from behemoth as well a forest featuring Nicholas Kivar force which I don't know just had a very very bland chord progression uninteresting guitar tremolo leads and a really overbearing lead vocal - sure it's nasty shirts in-your-face sure it is grim like a good behemoth track is but there are some qualities about it that I think could have been much better getting into the string of best tracks over here really really quickly got a bust em out we have this awesome track from Waylon storms over here that I want to recommend to you guys these guys are a noise rock band that are pretty heavy and incorporate some other elements of loud rock genres into their sound rope is the name of the track vocal performance is a pretty harrowing and the guitars are heavy as hell also TK meisa comes through with shook new single new track it's up aha a lot of Missy Elliott vibes on this one do not miss it it is quite great also digging this new standin on the corner track it is a very odd cross-section of spoken word and avant-garde jazz and just it's it's it literally is like going to frickin space it's totally insane I am very curious to kind of see where the weirdo left-field jazz collective kind of takes things next we also have a new banger from slow tie as well magic which is pretty stripped stripped back and raw but his insane vocal delivery kind of makes up for I guess the the overall simplicity of the track production-wise beat by kenny beats tho beat by kenny beats on this one and we have a new track from perfume genius or not really a new track it's I mean the new record is out so every track on the record is out and it's new Jason is the title the one that I want to point in your direction love it but don't want to talk too much about it as I am going to be reviewing the record this week also gonna be reviewing this new week the excuse me also going to be reviewing this week the new Moses Omni record so make sure to give this track a try as well at least at least this if not the whole album bless me I think this is quite good and ooh this guy over here dear Mari I got friends this track turned up in my inbox was intrigued by the weird music video but one over by the song it's a cute banger about friends having friends being being friends and loving your friends and being a nice friendly guy with friends we also have a cover over here of teenage dirtbag from Sega bodega shout out to Sega bodega and during electro which is quite beautiful tomorrow I listen to it the more I want to cry its breathy simple and just kind of vocals it's beautiful and Deerhoof over here I want to give a shout out to another track off of their new full-length album which is dropping at the end of this month damaged eyes squinting into the beautiful / hot Sun the more I listen to the new teaser tracks the more I am enjoying how noisy and simple and rudimentary a lot of the new material is I'm curious to see if it really ends up kind of uh warming up to me once I listen to the entire record and cupcake grilling friends is the name of her new banger over here she's Baha and a lot of fierce lyrics and bars on this one hard-hitting beat her aggressive flow and delivery is is totally just unstoppable on this one and uh also a carpenter brut finally coming through with a a studio version of a track that I guess has been in live rotation for a while a cover of a maniac maniac and OH also a four tet remix of caribou over here that you should most definitely check out that I think is quite funky and groovy very good and amnezia scanner track over here that I'm diggin quite a bit do not miss out on this one as it has a some pretty abrasive experimental vibes to it kind of a Konya influence as well as some parts ast R lists featuring Lolita give it a try give it a shot it's nuts and also the 1975 guys I like that this track is super catchy and yet a dreamy and intoxicating as hell this new string of singles for their latest record has have been really hit or miss for me but simultaneously every track seems to come from a totally different place in terms of vibe emotion musical style so pretty intriguing I wonder how many bases are going to be covered across this a very lengthy new album they have coming out very soon so I don't know I don't know guys I'm diggin it and that is it for the weekly track roundup hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this video I will see you in the next one Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever 
1h5eCTXfBGg,[Music] hi everyone deep tinny breath Tiano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new hayley williams album pedals for armor this is the debut full-length album of singer and songwriter hayley williams this LP is essentially one of those sink-or-swim moments in an artist's career where they are primarily known for fronting a pretty popular band and then they suddenly decide to break off and start doing their own solo stuff that artist is hayley williams the band Paramore who had already actually undergone some pretty radical changes on their last full-length LP after laughter making a quick break from the emo tinged pop punk and alternative rock that informed their most defining records and then swapping that out for the sounds of synth pop and new wave alternative dance but Hayley's new album sounds even more far removed from all of that since the tracklist is mostly made up of these very moody art rock and art pop songs some tracks that have a new wave flare as well but are a bit edgier this project was also released in different EP sized chunks throughout the year up until this point so the end result was an album that is is sequenced in like three different intervals 15 tracks there are some slight and gradual differences in style across each EP though as many of the teasers did forecast for this project a lot of songs here really to me just read as subpar Radiohead worship like for example roses Lotus violet iris the groovy drums the clunky bits of bass and cinematic strings all to me read like something Tom Johnny and the boys would draw up in the studio like at some point between in rainbows and King of Limbs that that specific area Simar leave it alone my friend there multiple tracks on here that to me just sound like they are coming straight out of that Radiohead era instrumentally anyway and it would be one thing if I felt like Williams and her primary producer on the record Taylor York we're putting a spin on this sound outside of maybe just giving it more of a pop appeal but they don't mind you none of these sar terrible or absolute trash and totally unlistenable simmer might have the best hook out of all of them but what made these tracks so underwhelming is that they just run like pail omage --is to a band they obviously have a lot of admiration for and believe it or not these are not the only songs or the only style that Haley and Taylor try to copy very weakly the song sudden desire with its explosive choruses of growling synth bass and over-the-top vocals just sounds like something out of Bjork's discography from the post or the homogenic era what catches me off guard even more though is when Haley and Taylor are working into these tracks completely garish ideas in an attempt to make them sound left field or weirder than they actually are like the horrendous and mutant vocals on cinnamon is this supposed to be pleasurable to the ear the stop start beats the funky bass the stark versus as well as the yeah I do not know what these lead vocals are that are really doubled up and absolutely hideous now granted I do kind of like the new wave grooves and vulnerable vocals on creepin but I don't really know if I am attracted to that track because the the first leg of this record is particularly rough honestly I don't really love a song on this record until we reach the track dead horse and while the tune on this one is good really sharp hook as well the more I listen to it the more lead dance beats and glistening synths on the course remind me of something I could have heard on after laughter but as I was talking about earlier with some of the more new wave cuts on this record a bit edgier this time around in a way though that is exactly when the record really begins to pick up at least a little bit for me when these songs that have more of a new wave influence start to creep in over yet' is another example of a track with a sharp song stronger groove and a hook that runs like an 80s pop anthem what I didn't expect though is four tracks with this sound to pretty much dominate the last third of the record but still the track pure love is a nice and bright punchy piece of sensual New Wave with a slight R&B twist I'm actually kind of impressed with Hailey's vocal transition on this track I didn't know she could pull this style of song off so well especially when she digs into her lower register and she's just belting out these husky notes with a lot of presents good yeah I can't really deny that even though I like the song I enjoy the hook I enjoy the vocal performance when I break down the instrumental while I do prefer this style on this side of the record to the more art pop and art rock cuts III it's it's still pretty derivative meanwhile the track taken has one of the more unique combinations of sounds and influences on it the rhythms and the chord progression is a little Latin there are some jazzy embellishments as well and then there is some of the tight rhythms and vocal lines that Haley is pulling off that seemed a little I guess Michael Jackson influenced I'm taken it's an odd fusion of ideas and styles but it actually kind of works we also get a funny alt dance number with sugar on the rim which sounds like the soundtrack to a small smokey underground club where you have a bunch of people wearing outlandish outfits and just voguing I mean I'd go there though I can't imagine that there are tracks in existence that would make this particular dancefloor ago a lot harder again while I think this section of the album has more of a pulse to it I still can't say it's terribly original and I'm not that much more enamored with the writing or the instrumental palettes especially on these sort of planes sort of dreamy closer crystal clear as far as Haley's lyricism is concerned I can't really speak ill of it I think a lot of the writing she delivers on this record is poetic personal and detailed really the quality level that we have come to expect from her over the years but still the songs the instrumentals and the overall flow of this record really severely could have used some work because the more I listen to this the more it just feels like a project that doesn't know where it wants to go what it wants to be it tries a bunch of different stuff and as a result I feel like it's just kind of okay at all that stuff it doesn't really master much of anything for sure there are some good foundational elements to this album and Haley is undoubtedly a very talented singer and artist but when she comes through with another project under her own name I would hope that we get a record that has a bit more focus and adventure to it also just a sound that seems specific to her overall I'm pretty indifferent toward this one sadly despite having enjoyed the last Paramore record so much and not wanting this to have fallen as flat for me as it did but I'm feeling a decent two strong five on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review

wTbjkUPpbhA,oh I feel like I look weird in my glasses now I don't wear them as much as I used to the rectangle ones anyway hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd i hope you're doing well and it is time for a review of the new natalia laughs workaday album un canto poor mexico vol 1 this is a new full-length LP from Mexican singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist Natalia LA for a day she returns to us after the epic one-two punch of both volumes of muses in 2017 and 2018 where she embraced the sounds of South American folk all stripes of it in a really big way while this sound has always been a part of Natalia's artistic DNA her previous albums trended more toward full pop twee pop and chamber pop than anything with far more of an indie appeal but with a Latin twist obviously but since the success of Musa and the key role Natalia played in the Disney Coco soundtrack she has become like this international conduit for some of the more classic sounds of Mexican music culture which is a role she is embracing hard on this new record which there is already a sequel to on the way une canto volume 1 pretty much runs like a compilation of originals covers collaborations renditions of songs from Natalia's back catalogue that are now given these extravagant and more rustic presentations even casual fans of her work should instantly recognize austell erase as well as Nuka s suficiente which sees a tight ranchera redo on this thing with flawless trade-offs between the horns and accordion some awesome luscious string sections too there are also a few tracks on this thing from useless Volume one mexicana err mosa as well as me tiara Veracruz sana both of which are extravagantly revised with dramatic acoustic guitar leads and strings and harp grande group vocals to some of the arrangements here and throughout the record fell a little overbearing to me especially on my first couple of listens but specifically with these tracks the more I replayed them the more they came off to me as the this is how they were always meant to sound one track I could not get over though in the tracklist was a paddock a Sofia the strings and horns on this one just sound too detached and sterile in comparison with the very low-key vocals and guitars underneath it sounds like something that had been tacked on in the recording by an old Hollywood sound studio this track might also feature the flattest duet on the entire record - in terms of chemistry still I love Natalia showing her ambition to cross as many Mexican musical touch stones as possible on this record there are bolero tracks on here and on the intro she goes full mariachi with one of several showy appearances from Veracruz music vets Losco holidays and the performance of the horns the guitars the vocals here it's so peppy darting from note to note with the speed of a hummingbird so much soul sounds like pure gold as well and when Natalya's vocals eventually jump into the mix it just gets better now many of my gringo americano viewers may not know this but this one this song is a true mariachi classic that has been covered and revamped countless times and it would seem like Natalya's goal here is to play it as close to the route as possible stylistically instrumentally while also packing in enough layers to choke an elephant many of the other covers on this record are pretty faithful to a songs original idea or at least a very popular rendition of said song for example the track Veracruz is presented as a first moody and then idyllic and romantic take on the classic goostin Lara track which has a serious vintage Flair not surprising considering that Lara was born just before the turn of the 20th century but not every song source of inspiration on this record is so old like with Yano vivo port vivian featuring Leonel garcia one half of the Latin R&B duo sin Bandera it's a beautiful tune for sure and originally landed on a record of duets by Latin pop great Juan Gabriel now Natalia was on that original duet on that track back in 2015 but I guess it wasn't enough to leave that song in the past she had to redo it and do another duet on it for this album which I I guess is fine instrumentally she played it a lot more rustic on this one which I like but truly stunning element of this song are the very close sensual quiet fast harmonies that play throughout the track the vocals really are a wonder on this one now of course there are some fresh originals in the mix on this thing too like my religion which is a cute accordion back track where Natalia basically proclaims music as her religion the fun you can hear she's having on the song vocally is is really infectious from start to end we also have una vida another great tune from Natalia in three time very low-key and intimate verses and bubbly courses on this one featuring cascading mariachi horns and strings finally I think the album's last third is just a tad bit mixed we do get the fiery sembrando fluores which features some of the most intense vocal and guitar work on the entire LP some incredible bite to this song despite it being one of the most skeletal stripped back and acoustic on the record lo que construye MOS i felt was a highlight - it's one of the more laid-back ranchera numbers on here one of the prettier duets as well however I cannot say the same for the sudden rap verse that pops in toward the end of in derecho de Nacimiento it really just did not work for me aesthetically it feels so against the whole old-world sound and vibe of the entire LP and sonically just overpowered every other sound in the mix I do appreciate that verses and the songs general message of resistance and giving a voice and power to the people and living for a cause so even though I wasn't crazy about that element of the song still a for ambition and great appreciation for Natalia for just wanting to and being passionate about putting forward socially substantive music finally I also wish there was more to the closing track on this record the guitar I think is just a bit too faint and even off at a few points but I suppose if there is an upside to this track being as raw and as naked as it is it's in Natalia's voice her performance here is nothing short of an incredible showing of her dynamics and personality especially when she's really selling that birdcall inspired refrain that also that yellow that she breaks into it in the very final moment of the song is is pure power it's a very good record it's a very very good record and I loved it I loved the hell out of it another amazing showing from Natalya on this one sure at the end of the day these tracks flow more like a disjointed collection more than they do a tight thematic grouping of songs but it's still one fantastic tune and performance and recording after another you can't really go wrong and ultimately I can't really deny this album does accomplish what it sets out to do which is give the audience a taste of the artists and sounds and ideas that have been key to the rich and unique tradition of Mexican music feeling a decent too strong eight on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana natalia la for COD a the forever 
VEm5LU1YfeA,Magga hi everyone my theny girl Tana here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new car album descendants of Cain this is a new album from Brownsville rapper kah his fifth full-length record today under his own name though he is no stranger to collaborating under different nombres the hermit and the recluse LP he dropped back in 2018 I would highly recommend as it is excellent if you do happen to be new to kosm usek I also recommend the Knights gambit as well as honor killed the samurai though it's hard to go wrong trying any one car record because he is easily one of the most consistent artists in the underground the poetic and spoken word ish tone of his delivery his quality over quantity approach to writing his smoky understated voice cinematic production choices the way he plays the mandolin opening company inc no I don't think he does that in his music but sometimes his music is so quiet it's almost like you could hear a pin drop even in the context of similarly minimalist spitters such as rock Marciano khat is still a creative enigma truly idiosyncratic this leads to a certain level of predictability in cosmic as he tends not to vary too far away from his unique sound however there can be another level of intrigue added to his stuff if he manages to work in a concept at the very least though I did go into this album expecting to hear subtle dramatic instrumentals set to one CD yet smart bar after another given the title of this thing I wouldn't be surprised to hear a biblical angle to these tracks to just look at these songs patron saint's brother's keeper pray I have a needle unto the dust going into this I actually started to wonder if this was going to be on the level of the Greek mythology tie-in on Orpheus a little while ago digging more deeply into descendants of Cain though I found that narrative Lee this was not quite as cohesive with a vast majority of these tracks now we're getting a steady dose of Christian mythos but it often doesn't come consistently enough to tie the entire record together even when it's not cause always steady and skilled pen is dropping lustrous lyrical gems the album's opening lines are among my favorite bars of his ever all of this of course is delivered at a very slow pace with a lot of emphasis on every word and of course much of the time these lines are adding up into grim focused topics on individual tracks like unto the dust where Kai is talking about people around him not always dying of natural causes not just passing away death in his world is usually violent and tragic there's also the track patron saint's which is not one of the more structured songs in my view but still Cod does go at great lyrical lengths to explain that the patron saints of his world in a way set a negative example for him because of the dark paths they led now obviously khat is smart enough to put this in a greater context of poverty inequality social injustice manifesting itself in a ruthless street life but catching on to that does require a lot more patience than I think a lot of people are willing to give to a hip-hop record these days or really any record honestly which is why listening to kosm usek can sometimes very much feel like reading a book which of course I don't mean as a knock against the record it just contributes to how unique the experience of a cop project is and it certainly makes listening to his stuff worth it especially when he is dropping some of his best and most robust verses yet like on a solitude of enoch had to use your fists to change your fiscal figuring out how to get rich became the ritual as teens bought full magazines if we had an issue we all had beef but for dinner having gristle and that cinematic beats which in the second half is nice speaking of the production on this project which I most definitely should make a note of my favorite beets really end up being some of the most unlikely like the acoustic guitar strumming faint strings and angelic vocals that make up the background of old justice the piercing and strange sound effects dissonant Keys and sparse percussion on prey are fantastic to the the off-kilter grumbling bass loop of unto the dust is pretty ear grabbing as well I will admit though the jangling and tinny bells just going off in the background of Land of Nod are the most pleasurable sound I don't think they add that much to the track for the most part though these beats they run in usual cough fashion they are quiet they are simple not doing too much but they still serve as a powerful foundation for his style there is though some production that runs maybe a bit too typical to my ear or just feels far less dramatic or gripping like the vaguely dreamy and also somewhat funky soul grooves on the eye of a needle which doesn't ruin the track but it does take the wind out of cos sails a little bit especially when the track hits this point where there's this sudden beat switch that makes a little to no sense in the overall instrumental composition of the song it is also a bit underwhelming to here cos circling around familiar themes such as paranoia without too much more to add to them the extreme amount of distrust on my brother's keeper for example is impressive but it's not anything we haven't heard from Cobb before even with the angle of the story of Cain and Abel being worked in the background I will say though this project does have one of the better endings of any column so far with the song I love Cadiz is best - poetically tribute some of the more positive influences in his life even though it doesn't necessarily fit very snugly in with the biblical themes of the rest of the record it's really refreshing to hear him rapping about something that is so uplifting inspiring and I guess just more heartwarming overall I liked this one I thought it had a lot of highlights and I certainly wouldn't tell a CAF fan not to listen to it even a newbie as I think this project still serves as a decent introduction to what exactly he does and what makes it special but chances are in the long run I will find myself going back more to honor kill the samurai Orpheus as well as Knights gambit feeling a light to decent seven on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my

_v2rjiXHvzQ,in all my years I never thought it would end like this help me Cal I can't Betty looks like we're surrounded on this one no not only am I gonna die I'm gonna die with you wait I got it just say the words I hope you're not serious saying the per third time could be dangerous you get it it's our only hope this new nav album it's not good yeah this new now yeah it's not very good this is a new album from NAV canadian rapper singer and producer it is the third time I am formally reviewing his work and yes yet again I think it is not good which given my thoughts on his past two projects given his performance on those projects given his lack of evolution and growth on this new project should be absolutely no surprise to anyone although I suppose in at least one sense it was to me because good intentions I did go into this record with good intentions in fact especially considering how much I enjoyed one of the teasers to this project Turks featuring gonna as well as Travis Scott and sure while Travis could have gone a bit harder on this track the instrumental was lush and gorgeous and immersive and even NAB's vocal performance didn't really under well me in the same way it typically does on other tracks and features so maybe in some way nav would turn a new leaf on this project maybe I have been exhibiting a bit of bias against the self-proclaimed brown boy and all I really needed to do was just acclimate myself to his sound to his style here are a few projects and now this one is gonna come around and really hit me well it did hit me as one of his most annoying projects yet standing at 50 minutes and believe me it is it is a long 50 minutes with 18 entire tracks and a relatively stacked feature list - Travis Scott like I said young thug is on here a few times future appears as well little Dirk there's even a posthumous pop smoke appearance on this thing - and if I could kick my deeper thoughts on this record off with a compliment I will say generally I think NAB did make some slightly better production choices on this one the instrumentals aren't anything out of the norm for him their trap their spacey it's a strong vibe however the full appeal of this project hinges on NAB's lyrics his vocals his flows his songwriting and those are as terrible as they've ever been yes with what seems like more appearances from other guests maybe a slightly increased production budget as well NAV artistically isn't really any better off than he was a few years ago really every key flaw of Knapp's previous projects also shows up on good intentions but maybe III guess with a grandeur showing for one there are weird and eyebrow-raising bars all over this thing like with the opener thank God I ain't got no baby mama between my VD if I come inside she got a king inside a ballet haha wow you you did that one on track six from this record status featuring little Uzi vert there are all these really weird verbal repetitions that make for a really awkward flow all over the track especially when NAB says things like Gucci on every sock on sock got her sucking on my cock cock cock god I stalk in rock rock rocks summertime need a drop job job there's also a really weird moment on the track coast to coast where NAB is talking about I guess it's drug use his drug addiction saying a fucking I rap about drugs all the time because I do them too double cup filled with mud I'm about to abuse you which I I'm thinking in the context of the song he's talking about like abusing the drugs that he's rapping about but the the inflection of the line does make it feel like it's a weird aside where he's like hey now I'm all drugged up and I'm about to abuse you this bar here about his jeweler hooking him up with canary-yellow jewelry and likening that to his jeweler pissing on him was certainly a curious moment and then there are tracks that just topically and conceptually are really gross or off-putting like on she hurt and where it's it's it's just bar after bar after bar of pure pandering patronizing but maybe some people would call it sipping but still it's not really that great of a look then there are other cuts like Brown boy which given how much have reps that in his songs I was expecting a little bit more out of like I don't know maybe like a really cool brown boy anthem that everyone who he feels like identifies with him could really get down with but for the most part the track just sort of sees him feeding into this delusion that everyone wants to be him and would trade places with him and is so incredibly jealous of him bit of a missed opportunity there but on top of it and this is an aside I feel like tracks like this in a way work is dess racist erasure and I will not stand for it but honestly the greatest crime of NAB's lyrics isn't that he has all these awful standout bars that just stick in your mind because they're so unbearably cringe really it's more again that his content is so general as he's just continually rapping about how much drugs he's doing how many girls he's fucking how much he's chilling and vibing and all that without much in the way of any variation or specifics and sure there are points on the record like overdose and other personal spots in the tracklist to where he's rapping a bit more about his come up his background his family his addiction and his were negative and I guess depressive feelings that he deals with a week-to-week but again I feel like he really fails to make this connect to the listener in any significant or emotional way because he doesn't really orient anything around these thoughts these ideas these feelings a lot of the time they're just packed into fleeting bars that go shoulder to shoulder with the same generally druggie and a materialistic content he delivers most of the time the reason NAB's music feel so vapid and substance list is that there's not much of a focus on anything of personal significance or emotional importance even as he's bragging about the money he's making or the designers he's wearing it's all pretty low impact as it's very unenthusiastic its flatly delivered and it's not paired with the greatest vocal melodies or performances in the world either so I guess that's the next thing with this LP NAB's vocals and singing are still terrible his voice is tiny it's thin it has no presence it has no personality with the touches of auto-tune he places on his voice he sounds robotic it's like he's an AI his delivery is so stone-faced and emotionally deficient and he sounds like this for nearly 18 tracks almost an hour after a while it becomes mind-numbing especially mind-numbing because his writing is still terrible I have no idea how it is that NAV continually writes with these same super basic cyclical tiny tiny flows like tiny flows very small flows microscopic flows I will admit that I don't think about this as much as I should when I review hip-hop music but NAV really makes me come face to face with it and it's that when he is writing a verse it's like he can't conceive of a flow for that verse that lasts longer than a bar or might vary up slightly on the next bar creating some kind of greater pattern I'm just having my brain slowly fried because it's being deprived of any kind of variation or stimulation outside of this one little evident bet that that the middle bet bet that the banana bet bet bet medvedev it have bet bet bet bet bet bet bet like Jesus please do something else like for a few tracks it's not that great but as the album really starts to wear down on me mentally I am just having my soul sucked away just one minute at a time beyond that there are some tracks that are sleepier and more boring than others like Saint Laurent and tracks the feel more under written than others like the cut here with Don Tolliver where the ending is pretty abrupt and structurally there's way less to this track than pretty much every other song here so yes there are spots on this thing where he is genuinely half-assing it again but just like with wreckless and just like with bad habits this album is so so so so devoid of anything interesting or gauging or even vaguely memorable now what's worse and this is hilarious because NAB does not have an original idea bumping around in his head of course he had to release this project little Aussie vert style which if you guys remember he recently dropped his eternal a-take project and then just a week after he sort of came out with a deluxe version of that project attaching an entirely new project to it little Aussie vert vs. the world - so he had one album stacked on top of another a week later NAB has done the same thing dropping Brown boy - but he didn't even wait a week he put this whole thing out just again a few days later and what is hilarious about this in comparison with a little Uzi ver thing I mean I'm not crazy about either project but they both sound pretty distinct you know eternal a take has a totally different vibe than little Aussie vert versus the world in terms of the production aesthetics in terms of the guest appearances in terms of the overall flow of both projects Brown boy - stylistically sonically vocally instrumentally everything does not really sound that much different the good intentions it's like you just took the same fucking shit and just stacked it on top of the same fucking shit huh I am tired I grow tired I grow so tired of this please please I I want to suffer less I want to suffer not as much as I'm suffering now please on the next record if we could please just have a like a bit more of you know like like it like a smidge more of emotion just something anything anything just anything other than this and then more of this on top of this anything this nav albums it's not good 
Ok1V0DmhlOg,hi everyone you're the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another edition of great albums where i go over a series of records that i thought were really good over the past couple of months the the initiation of this whole quarantine thing threw me off didn't end up doing one for last one month so now i am deciding to uh you know get my ish together here and tell you guys about some records that i do not want you to miss out on these are albums that i think over again the past couple of months i i have shown to be pretty good sticking out standing out in my mind highly enjoyable all the links to reviews and stuff for them are down below so check them out give them a listen take some time you know do some self-care on the music end of things here we go code orange underneath wow this is a crushing futuristic experience loving what this band is doing with metal right now with industrial music and just how cutting edge the production techniques on this record are i love how synthetic and high def and sharp it all sounds and yet so incredibly distorted heavy and visceral as well the band really makes a fantastic blend of metal and electronic music without really taking away from the core appeals of each style so uh heavily heavily heavily messing with this record over here loving it also shout out to rap ferreira also known as milo scallops hotel and a few other pseudonyms too he has come through with this purple moonlight pages project which is a very smart verbose and dense little jazz rap record with a lot of a very detailed and organic production on it too some of his best flows and rhymes in a while as well he's just killing it just killing it on this record love to hear milo at a high point and i love that after all these years he is still surprising us still trying new things still every once in a while he's got a left hook in there like bam didn't didn't see that one coming ninja bam that's this is one of those moments i got banned next shout out to horse lords for their new record over here the common task which is a really cool and groovy combination of experimental rock kraut rock psych rock math rock it's very busy it's very abstract and out there some very dry and prickly bits of guitar and drums and it's just a very odd sound but also just again the grooves on this the linear uh directions of a lot of these songs and the intense pacing of them as well keeps me engaged from start to finish on pretty much every track here uh digging what these guys are doing yeah hell yes horse lords want to also shout out here songwriter and electronic music producer nicholas jarr on his new project here census it's really interesting how every solo project from nick goes in a totally different direction and even this one i did not see coming as he is dabbling in a lot of very abstract and formless and experimental and ambient music on this project really going out there into the darkest recesses of sound i also love the variety he approaches this lp with because despite the entire thing being so shadowy and strange and left field he finds a lot of interesting ways to i guess embody those ideals of course also want to do a mention here of the new strokes album the new abnormal which in my opinion is their best record in years some killer songs on this thing and a bit of a new direction as well one of their most lo-fi recordings in a long time and also the songs on this thing are pretty expansive you know really foregoing uh the usually brief and verse chorus verse structures these strokes are known for these tracks really sort of stretch out into a lot of strange territories rick rubin on production as well and some of my favorite stroke songs ever too so yes the new abnormal yes laura marling song for our daughter fantastic singer songwriter record with one amazing song after the next i i like how no bs and no frills this album is laura doesn't really make it to be much more than just a really good quality batch of songs with good storytelling great vocals quality instrumentals super simple everything you need nothing you don't but simultaneously not bland and underwhelming and skeletal or anything like that i know i've pointed to the lyrics being good already but i'll just reiterate one more time i think this is some of the best storytelling on any laura marling album at least in regards to some of these tracks so check it out also hell yes to rina sawayama coming through with her debut record over here sawayama totally killed it with clarence clarity on the production love the variety of pop stylings on this thing how improved the vocals are too the great song writing as well there are some moments where i think the production could have been better but uh yeah i love all those qualities of the record also how personal she gets on a lot of these tracks too with this album and i was hoping this would be the case i really did get a better sense of who rina is as an artist and a creator just all around quality album and expect many more from rena to come it should also be no secret that i am enjoying the electronic cumbia art pop fusions of lido pimienta's new record miss colombia as well really awesome portrayals of these styles coming together over great songs fantastic production stunning vocal performances too also love that um lido tries her best to really tribute and make clear connections to the indigenous styles of music that influence what she does so much do not do not do not do not do not under any circumstance miss out on this record it will undoubtedly at least for me be one of the best latin records of the year next shout out to black dresses with the record peaceful as hell which is a crushing abrasive noisy uh poppy it's it's uh god punky it's uh i just love how hard hitting and visceral this record is and just how cute and friendly the songs are the record really does live up to the title peaceful as hell it's nice it's kind it's sweet in some respects it is easy on the ears but it's also trying to make a ruckus make hell of those feelings make hell of those sounds it's killing you with kindness it's gutting you it's just disembelling you with kindness it's decapitating you with kindness it is just bleeding you out uh and and uh freezing you to death with kindness let me not neglect to mention producer chris keys teaming up with rapper quelly chris again for the sequel to innocent country innocent country too which made for chris's most sobering melodic and mellow record today in my opinion pretty potent project emotionally that may hit you just in the way that it needs to during these quarantined times finally a shout out to a really good somewhat psychedelic lo-fi noise rock record from the boys in dope body a home body the band is back with a fully locked and loaded quarantine album over here and they are sounding as good as ever even in this somewhat diminished capacity uh they're kind of a doing a bit of a mixtape thing over here with a lot of random ambient and experimental music interludes too some of those influences do seep into the core songs of the album and and when they do that's really awesome and yeah just some of the most fun songs the band has dropped in a long time especially since uh they've been broken up for a little while so uh it's it's been a while it's been a while it's been a while so uh yeah shout out to all of those records they're all linked down below don't miss out on any of them i think they're all great i think they're all fun and um yeah yeah that is it tran position have you given any of these albums a listen if you have that's awesome if you haven't please again check out the reviews look the records up and i will see you guys in the next video over here next to my head is another one that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel anthony fantano great

fdd87GmShe4,uh hey hi hey hi hey hey hey hello hey hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd I hope you're doing well and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the worst and best tracks of the week they're all linked down below like usual so you can check them all out for yourself and come to your own conclusions the tracks that I thought were worst best and meth this week are listed as follows but first our turntable AB link is down there our patreon link is down there in the description box as well we get kicked back from the turntable a blank hell yes so if you get yourself some music over there and that is how far back my thumb goes that's great also our patreon page if you want to support us and get some extra bonus monthly content along with access to our discord that would be amazing too and a few shout outs in this video that have been past musical shoutouts past from Austin to me to give to you first off we have oak Jung Lee's another old story apparently this is a highlight from her debut album with her new quartet some very nice chamber music with an improvisational Flair and also we're gonna give a shout out to this live set on NTS from echo 2k and blade drain gang comes through with a great live show for NTS radio again according to Austin and also want to give people a warning here because there there are like some flashing lights in this video so those of you who who have issues with those sorts of visuals keep in mind okay just a bit of a warning there with that alright worst tracks this week worst tracks this week what are they we have a handful one good intentions new project from nav we have a song from a title status featuring a little woozy vert and I'm saying nothing about it I'm saying nothing about it whatsoever it's in the worst section that's all you need to know right now because I am reviewing good intentions very soon all thoughts on this track and others will be said in that video so sorry sorry you can't know right now it's secret okay okay all right me goes Taco Tuesday a new single from the trio and it's easily one of their worst songs ever Cornelia exchanged beat just really dumb all around I'm surprised like it am I wrong is this not a Taco Bell ad because if it's not this should be a fucking Taco Bell ad like I'm surprised they would release a track this embarrassing without it being like an advertisement tie-in for something maybe it is and I'm not noticing but this should definitely be like you know Tostitos salsa or something it it lights it should be an ad for something it just sounds like me goes doing a commercial but they're willingly releasing this is like hey this is like the best music we can make right now it's trash alright moving on from there a Kalani can I featuring Tory Lanez I know a lot of people are kind of hyping up her new project over here but I'm just finding many tracks including this one to be so bland so sleepy so forgettable vocal performances like way way way way way below the threshold of engaging I'm not even finding anything remotely enticing or sexy about it either I just don't really get it it's very sleepy comatose well I guess what passes for R&B right now yeah I can't really say much about it frankly moving out from there we also have this track from Chris Brown and young thug go crazy they just dropped this new project Simon B and I am not really seeing the appeal of it frankly I mean some of thuggish vocal performances are pretty good but I just don't think he sounds all that great or at least he is not complimented within this overly squeaky clean super pristine I guess backdrop that you usually get on a Chris Brown album it seems like a thug er was kind of moving more toward Chris Brown's sound and vice-versa at least on a great deal of the tracks here and yeah it just seemed like a overproduced to me you know just a little soulless little too I guess sanitary I guess and what I love so much about suckers music and his sound a lot of the time when he does come through with a great project because I'm still talking about it um uh you know III like how wild and out of control of feels and this just came off too measured to me you know just too predictable too bland but that's how Chris Brown's music usually runs alright let's get into the math section tracks that I was not blown away by but certainly wanted to talk about or a point in your direction we have a new track from woods over here can't get out which I guess is a fitting title for these times that we live in currently and um kind of a surprising track from woods as its felt like a bit of like an 80s track there's some about it that felt uh like a little new wave air or something some beautiful glistening tones cascading over each other on the chorus again not quite as weird or folky as Woods's music usually is and and even when they have drifted away from that stuff in the past it at least still felt a little bit within the bands wheelhouse or like they're not moving too far away from their typical sound but this just felt like a big change of pace and not really in a bad way I will say the verses are kind of underwhelming but the hook is spot-on moving on from there fire tools a music project I want to give a big shout out to over here as i ignorant lee just sort of came upon fire tools recently even though fire tools has kind of been a thing for a little bit apparently but still what I am digging on some of the tracks from this new project specifically the song over here it's now safe to turn off your computer is that it's um a really odd and experimental combination of like black metal and industrial and vapor wave I mean I'm not crazy about every piece of it that I'm hearing but it is a really unique combination of sounds and styles coming together more cohesively than I think they would on paper just thinking about such a thing conceptually moving on from there we have another track from Mike Skinner aka the streets where the fuck did April go I'm digging this more than some of the other streets stuff that has been coming out as of late still a little underwhelming not a lot of bite to it but what's funny about that is that this is one of the least hip-hop songs to drop from the streets in this current run of like you know singles and teaser tracks and stuff this this is almost like borders on unspoken word like over a dance beat a lot of the time a lot of some vocals too it's not too bad you know I think there are elements where the vocals could have gone a bit harder where the instrumental could be a bit more lush and a bit more I guess dramatic to really sort of emphasize the singing and emphasize the storyline of the track but but still you know it's I guess I will keep tabs on what might continues to drop under the name the streets because you know it's it's a still an event for him to be making music again in such a big way all right a little big have come through with a new single hip no dancer I think after the blow-up of their last dance craze the outfit is trying that one more time with this little hip hip jig that's kind of cute I guess the song itself is a nice blend of House and pop and euro dance but not one of their catchy and more eccentric songs for sure the dance itself is is okay I guess don't know if this one's going to be quite as much a craze as the last one but I guess we will see all right moving on from there we have Justin Bieber and ariana grande teaming up on a somewhat bland track Ariana's vocals I think are pretty good but the song and instrumental itself is pretty trite at this point like we've heard this song before and Justin Bieber adds virtually nothing to it so I don't know it's it's well-intentioned and you know I guess we need songs like this at least some people do at this point in time but this is um could have been better could have been a lot better all right we also have Jenny Beth of savages Fame coming through on a new track over here heroine love her vocal performance on this track but I'm just not really seeing what's so exciting about the instrumental not that she needs to be doing her thing over this very fiery wild reverb heavy punk rock and post-punk but there's just not a whole lot of bite beyond the drums on this track the drums are pretty good but everything on top of them is just like really falling flat and not that intriguing whatever is going on it needs to have a bit more punch to it doesn't have to be guitars doesn't have to be noise or anything like that but but jeez like get something else besides the layers of whatever you have going on here because it is bland we also have Joe Goddard working with Hayden Thorpe of a wild beasts fame on this sweet little piece of dance dance pop excuse me unknown song I think it does drag on for a bit or at least it lacks of enough variation to make the the final leg of the track interesting but it's got a good groove to it and Hayden I didn't necessarily think would vocally work too well in this sort of context and yet he does so shout out to this song and Joe and Hayden we also have Bob Dylan coming through false prophet new song new single while I'm not crazy about the quality of the vocal performance I do like how dramatic the song is and I do feel like this is a one of a Bob's darker songs in a while so it's a little gruff it's a little nasty it's a little bit of a reflection and then the dark Griff deed type of paradigm we live in currently so I don't know give it a shot give it a try we also have a Denzel curry over here shout out to him who has dropped this a little freestyle over here with two verses on it him and a Tommy Swisher on the track cool soul sample and beat I'm just saying though and it's got a lot of motivational inspirational lyrics in it not too bad not too bad at all we have also over here a new track a new single from Charli XCX as we are on the cusp of her releasing her new quarantine record I finally understand is the song it's it's easily the most like low-key track of this teaser cycle thus far I can see myself digging on this a bit more in the context of the record and it may be growing on me with some more listens but I will say as a single with a first impression where first impressions like really matter it did not hit all that hard I'll say that moving on from there we also have bad bunny over here who has dropped a surprise record out of the blue don't know if this was always intended or if this is sort of like a reaction to the current you know situation we're all in the midst of but bendy Sione's I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly is the name of this one and it's not as creative sonically and instrumentally as a lot of the tracks off of his last LP vocally it's pretty strong I suppose but the song isn't really there the instrumental is not really there I'll maybe dig into more tracks from this but just as a taster this is kind of so-so you know feels like almost going back to his breakout record in a way where things are just a little bit too stripped back alright we also have over here a couple of new tracks from Brock Hampton we have NST and also the song what's the track things can't stay the same and pretty much - Lucy type tracks from Brock Hampton without like the best production quality and the most members involved in everything but still some interesting ideas flowing throughout these tracks I'll say that neither of them are terrible and you know that they both certainly say to me okay so Brock Hampton said I was like some banger type ideas you know left in the tank and and maybe what they're kind of signalling with these two tracks is like hey we're gonna go a little bit harder in the future stay creative try some new stuff try some different stuff here are some samples here's some like g-funk here's some like southern DJ screw-type fusion shit it's all over the place and certainly again intriguing so a shout out to Brock Hampton for uh holding us over and keeping things interesting with these two tracks even if they're not like the best song as I've ever heard from the group or anything like that also did a full-length review these tracks over on the Fantana channel to feel free to check those out alright we also have a track over here from none other than Alex Cameron it is a paul kelly cover of the song before too long yeah drags on a bit and I think the instrumental could have used a bit more variation or at least taking some more liberties with the track but I don't know it's not bad it's not bad I guess I'll say what about this cover that struck me was a I can see how a song like this with a narrative like this would matter so much to Alex Cameron because he writes in a very similar fashion as far as like what he enters a track wanting to say wanting to message to the listener how to deliver a narrative to the listener I I could see how it artists like Paul Kelly would be a big influence on him alright we also have a Guba the new track from 6-9 did a review over this on the Fantana channel and yeah it's okay it's okay it's got some decent moments that that junkyard dog scream your brains out type of delivery it's still there it's still pretty hard-hitting it's like six nine hasn't skipped a beat missed a missed a step it's like he wasn't even gone I think the track could have gone harder instrumentally and there are some portions where he is trying to like really rap straight that are pretty underwhelming and boring and and the message or rather the the tone of the song doesn't really amount to much more than the type of shit he usually raps about combined with I don't know if you really want to subject yourself to that go for it but I'm not here to be trolled you know so I'm not here to be trolled all right best tracks the best ones that stuck with me this week let's go buh-bam willie nelson we have a track over here that is a Johnny paycheck cover of I'm the only hell my momma ever raised it's a pretty low-key country ballad at least the way Willy delivers it his rendition over here and you know it's it's just a my son Mother's Day drop you know so if you're looking for that extra little you know last last Mother's Day thing to throw in or belated you know hey mom sorry I didn't call yeah here's a cool song check it out mom love you if you're looking for that kind of thing you know maybe this is your song maybe this is your youtube link we also have over here a new track from Weezer Hiro reviewed it over on the Fantana channel - I thought it was pretty good solid hook little guitar heroism cool power pop vibes as well Weezer a sounding solid so far for this ridiculous fucking looking album that should be dropping at some point this year all right we also have a new track from sotai enemy it's a banger he's back with a bang ha and just good flows great energy references to that terrible award show debacle that he was involved in a little while back yeah but some loving the vibin blood in the energy so ty sounding his mean as ever we also have Sleaford mods over here on the cusp of dropping a compilation of tracks to span back to the earlier points of last decade second is the name of the song and it sounds kind of like yeah you know your classic super minimal driving post-punk II very verbose Sleaford mods you know just like the older shit ii diggin it loving it loving it also over here ooh want to give a shout-out to this student because I sort of came across his music on Twitter and dug it quite a bit at least what I have heard of it over there tried a little bit more on some of the streaming platforms and thought the rest of the record child that he has out was just okay but this song over here really stood out to me all my dogs and it's sort of a lazy day sort of dejected a little bit King cruel ish a little bit Mac DeMarco ish type of ballad and I and I don't mean those comparisons in a mean way or anything not to write the kid off or anything but at this very very early stage of his career where he is fusing those sounds that maybe like a little bit of like some hip hop production in at least like on the b-side in everything because you know there are some sequence rhythms in there that add a bit more punch to that type of balladry on this song and is some of the lingo he works in the lyrics to I think you know is at least a nod to that genre as well it's a coulomb an amalgamation of sounds but ultimately is like you know very much about it and you know some some cool dejected vocals it's a it's a little weary it's young and weary and kind of digging that vibe kind of digging that vibe so all my dogs check it out check it out because I think I think kid has potential alright moving on from there preservation producer preservation working with navy blue on this new song over here which is titled North bridge and what struck me about the track is that it's it sounds a lot like kah of course then I wasn't surprised to sort of remind myself that preservation has worked with kah so you know if you've dug on navy-blue especially when he recently worked with Earl because he has that a some rap songs track and you want to hear him over a beat with a very sparse you know skeletal sort of a delivery and build that is of like a Qasim then I guess give this a try shout out to everyone shout out to everyone Earl maybe blue preservation cos shot it to everybody shot and everybody move not from there Lydia Ainsworth whose work previously I was not really all that familiar with but I am liking this track over here forever it is a nice solid lush and detailed piece of chamber pop with a lot of personality to it lovely to listen to lovely to listen to Lianne La Havas has come through with the new track paper-thin it's super low-key guitar vocals not like super rich or lush or layered production or anything like that but if you know LeAnn and you know her music and you know her fantastic voice she does not need much more presuming here that we are being teased you know to expect some new music some new something down the pipe I hope so maybe she's just holding people over during this time where everyone's stressed and wanting music and all that but you know what would be nice sir right now and then some new Lianne La Havas I don't know because she's always dropping some quality shit all right we also have Kim Petrus over here Malibu new single which is a super punchy catchy tight and rhythmic new pop single it has a strong Michael Jackson vibe coming through on some of the grooves and some of the vocal lines too pretty impressed that Kim could pull off such a style you know with so much grace and so much I guess faithfulness toward a MJ sound so digging it liking it liking it a lot we have also over here Johnny Pierce in the drums coming through with like a guided meditation piece it's pretty lengthy but it's also a very fun and tasteful and engaging and interesting maybe you know in in these troubled times at the moment this is exactly not the type of thing that you need and this isn't necessarily my vibe all the time either but uh I don't know I found intriguing I found it creative I found it refreshing and regenerative mentally and emotionally so I don't know give it a shot it's a it's a little guided meditation I suppose it's a guided meditation we have so here Jessie where save a kiss which is a excuse me cool little single where she comes through with a very grand chorus on this one I'm loving the rush of vocals on this hook and digging this track almost as much as the last teaser too it's it's been a while since I've really looked forward to a Jessie ware project and I would say I'm getting to that point again I'm getting to that point again I'm getting there again we have also over here Fontaine's DC who I loved some of the teasers to their last record was not really crazy about the quality of the album once I heard the entire thing but I am being hooked in once again with this new single a hero's death which is a very cool verbose piece of post-punk with an interesting music video attached to it too but I don't know I I guess we'll see you know I'm liking the band's sound on this one I'm liking the energy I'm liking lyrics as well remains to be seen if I end up being blown away by deeper cuts on a new record or anything like that but I am I'm still fucking with what the band is doing here and there and this is certainly an instance of that we have also over here Dirty Projectors who from what I understand now are planning on dropping more fire EPS I did a review of their last EP over on the fan tanto channel loved it fantastic EP and now they are dropping more music with again more EPS on the way lose your love is the name of this new one and it's got a great beat behind it some awesome vocal layers super poppy super catchy I'm not quite as funky as the stuff from the last project a wandering furnace Seymour grooves and just more strong hooks on this new one it would be interesting if every EP had like a different flavor to it and I don't know just like in the direction of this new track like in the sassy kind of fun tongue-in-cheek little music video as well and yeah just digging it loving it digging it we have also over here Christine and the Queen's coming through the Neil Young cover with some great vocal work some great vocal layering as well maybe not as dramatic as the last cover that I have covered from Christina in the Queen's but this one certainly is is up there you know again the vocals are a super impressive on this one give it a try and also shout out to Bibby o who I'm not always a fan of Bibby o stuff but every once in a while Bibby o drops a fantastic little fulk banger and and this one in particular is very very very beautifully arranged instrumentally sleep on the wing is the title of this one and it's it's quite lovely it is very lowly it's a lovely song compositionally and just in terms of just the the again the the arrangements worked into it to so give it a shot I also want to give a shout out to Shabalala on this one who were coming through with a new track on us and in fearing if in fear no adios and feet and in fear no años in in fear no sorry espanol is not you know my forte but anyway this song is crushing it is heavy as shit it'll just smash your skull in it's it's you know it's got some metalcore vibes it's but but yeah it's so heavy and crushing it's you know it's it's got like the girth of a doom song you know what I mean just just visceral vocals visceral everything uh I felt like as far as the band's sound the wind was taken out of their sails a little bit with their last LP and while this new song over here is not quite as jeroni as as like the album of theirs that I really kind of fell in love with and it's really sort of turned me on to their stuff I I am liking kind of the intensity being upped a little bit on this new track over here so give it a try give it a shot it is badass and that has been the weekly track roundup everyone thank you very much for watching hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this video and yeah yeah let me know uh if you love me and just chill just hang out just wait for the next video the next review to come out it will soon and yeah I'll see you guys very soon on the YouTube channel because I'm you know we're here every day doing our thing here every day pretty much every day alright I'll see you soon bye bye love ya 
Uka2_LVDiv8,hi everyone stately home Tanner here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new dope body album home body this is a brand new album from once disbanded and now recollected Baltimore rock band dope body it was back in 2016 when the band called it quits it was a bitter end to what I saw as a vastly underrated and underappreciated discography I mean natural history and life er alone made dope body one of the best noise rock bands of the 2010s in my view the band finished things off on a somewhat abstract and risky note with 2015's come a relatively short project filled with these crushing heavy cyclical abrasive songs separated by these experimental sound pieces I even did an interview with the band around the time they released this LP where they revealed their intentions to drop records maybe in quick succession that were shorter filled with strange disjointed ideas ran a bit like a mixtape and even though there were some gaps on counc I would have loved to have heard filled this was still a prospect I was excited to see come into fruition but dope body called it quits before they were able to make good on their plans but now the band is back and they have chosen to start making and releasing music again at a very odd time that would seem they are embracing this with a consciously quarantine angle project home body with track titles like living room and hermit King the band is keeping it a little low fie and close to home not only that but it would seem the band has fully transitioned into this mixtape mindset they were evolving into around conch maybe the brittle sound quality and chaotic mixing helped get them in the mood I don't know either way the odd flow of abstract sound art and funky noise psych ragers as well as mutant pop rock makes for a fun and messy listen and as varied or as randomized as the sounds on this record seem to be they all melt together into this uniformly weird scuzz out experience the whole record kicks off with Jonny bag of smoke which had strong pulse to it thanks to some driving bass and drums all of which is colored by the sunburned guitar leads and wishing shots of noise I cannot describe what these sounds are but they're on tempo and they are very shrill and add quite a bit of character to the mix this is also just one example of many on this LP where you might get a hard rockin track in the band somehow is finding ways to throw in some extra layers of noise just to make things a bit more abrasive or left-field or chaotic the track is pretty catchy too despite trying to overtly avoid doing a straightforward verse chorus verse type of structure the song especially pops when the band starts to bring in these gnarly descending guitar chords just before giving way to this disorienting sound collage I should also note that frontman Andrew Lyman is on this track and many others here sounding as expressive and as wild as ever after this we have the song sour apple which is much sweeter than the intro surprisingly the hook on this one reminds me of like a solid piece of 90s radio pop rock I don't know what you've done to me but it tastes like zap Apple I don't know why but this hook is something I can imagine like Jane's addiction's singing back in the day but obviously it's being delivered now with a much more abrasive sound and lower fidelity mix also the drummer cymbals on this track just sound off like white noise and I can't completely tell because the sound of this track is so cacophonous but are there some hand drums in there somewhere there's some extra rhythms and they're just adding a bit more of a groove to it and I love it but still that hook and the fuzzy sugar-coated guitar leads that color the background and in a very busy way they do a lot to sweeten the deal meanwhile the track fade to you is a bass II compressed thick crushing but also casual and somewhat nonchalant rocker with a very laid back vocals there's also something about the vocal line on this track the chord progression the bass - that runs a little bluesy but aesthetically it's so far removed from that sound I wouldn't necessarily call it a blues track I guess if I had to compare this to anything it sounds like a piece of music that arose from the swamp after like 25 years of there being toxic waste mercilessly dumped into it after this point on the album is when all of these strange abstract instrumental bits start to work their way in many of them just about a minute and change we get a decent variety of sounds and textures coming out of them to some looping samples and ghostly vocals snippets on Lily which kind of reminds me of like OneNote Rick's point never is replica the track pepper presents a lot of prickly synthetics meanwhile ESD is a dark ambient piece with a very vast atmosphere there doesn't seem to be much method to the madness on these tracks but nothing drags on for longer than it really needs to and I suppose the tone of these pieces is as difficult to predict as the tone of the core songs themselves on the record since on one track you might get some writhing blaring noise rock with a psychedelic slant delivered in 7/8 time mind you then on another track living room we have bare naked rhythms that are back with these throbbing synthetic bits of bass and very noisy guitars some vocal riffing as well easily the most stark skeletal and maybe impromptu song on the entire record there are some other hard-hitting highlights that I thought were worth making note of - like the very loud tense and abrasive hermit king one of the most killer songs here the robotic grooves of no scene are pretty refreshing - then there's the closing track Redux which is a huge triumphant shot of noise and Colour it's a short track yes but it does successfully bring together the album's love of ambience and also psych leaning noise rock with a kind of druggie aesthetic to it for a record that is this rough around the edges it is a pretty grand closing even though this record is very noisy and and maybe not as well produced as some of dope bodies recent stuff at least the stuff they were dropping just before they broke up I really did enjoy this one this has become in a very short time one of my favorite projects from that like with conch there are still some elements that I would love to see smooth over or worked in more creatively or expanded in a way that just leaves the tracks here feeling a bit more complete but generally I did love most of the tracks here and I thought the band did a pretty great job of transitioning into this mixtape mindset they were beginning to work with onk-onk what's even more impressive is that they pulled it off under the current conditions feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana dope body the forever 
AaTq83KFeKo,hi everyone ex-anthony a12 tano here the internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new umbra vitae record shadow of life umbra v thai is a super group of sorts who have been turning heads in the music scene due to their connections to 100 demons hate breed twitching tongues the red cord converge even job for a cowboy and uncle acid and the deadbeats which is a really interesting series of bands to have connections to before starting a new group but i think one could make a pretty educated guess as to what genre they might be dabbling in i'd say it's about a 99.9999999 chance it's going to be metalcore so yes a group of guys with a lot of metalcore in their background started a metalcore band but this band also adopts a style that has undergone quite a bit of change over the past decade and that's deathcore the primal and breakdown heavy hybrid of death metal and metalcore that peaked commercially in the 2000s and now is more varied than it's ever been as you have a lot of groups these days going progressive with the style complete with guitar riffs and super slick production thinking of bands like uh the contortionist as well as uh born of osiris whose album covers literally look like galaxy brain memes you have other strains that have been popping up over the past 10 years too shibalba who brings doom metal into the fold also uh thy art is murder that has a bit of a more of a technical edge shadow of intent who are one of the more melodic acts on the scene though it may be a surprise to anyone who might usually avoid anything labeled as death core the genre is not nearly as homogenized as it used to be it's certainly worth giving another shot especially if you're the type of person who might have heard job for a cowboy back in the mid 2000s and felt utterly disgusted that wasn't me though i loved that shit so of course i was excited to hear what umbra's take on this style was going to be given the variations we've been seeing as of late but i quickly found the songs on this record don't sound like an entirely new venture meaning the band is fronted by jacob bannon of converge and also has kurt blue of converge doing production and that seems like just enough to make this sound like converge kind of doing like a death metal thing still having said that nothing on this record really drags on for too long nearly all the tracks here end around or before the two-minute mark the 10 tracks in total don't even add up to a full half hour so this is a pretty blistering listen everything hitting you very hard very fast in a very short period of time like the track return to zero which if you listen to that it will absolutely smother you with layer upon layer of drums and bass and guttural screen vocals richard these portions are segued to and from with these really sticky tremolo pick guitar passages also there's a nice nice nice heavy sharp breakdown on this track too in total the track is animalistic it is visceral it is deafening it's like a brick to the face not the most original writing in the world but the energy is certainly something to take into account i was also pretty impressed with the absolutely demented riffs and grooves on fear is a fossil which pairs really well with the monstrous layers of vocals and some of the passages of super sinister guitar leads too i also want to take note of the track intimate inferno which is one of the more slow burning songs on the record a moment with a bit more melody woven into the madness i love that passage of speedy blast beats that kick this track off and the way they're topped with these very dramatic and somewhat grim tremolo guitars and just a dissonant groans as well though i have to say i was disappointed to hear the band embrace this all too common death core stereotype when they wrote this really great gloomy passage around the midsection and then suddenly transitions it into a slightly slower version without really adding all that much to it shut up beta boy that part's for the pit here here well regardless the whole record is really destructive sounding if you're looking for something that is going to melt your face in 26 minutes or less you might just enjoy this but for me the more i listen to this thing the combination of death metal and converge style metal core either started sounding too obvious or like oil and water not only that but there are many passages on this thing where the writing isn't really all that flavorful like the track ethereal emptiness despite kicking off with these throttling blast beats and some kind of impressive guitar work when the track suddenly busts into one of the most generic breakdowns i've heard in the past few years it warrants a bit of an eye roll we also have a lot of tiny and short-winded death metal leads and chunky cro-magnon guitar riffs on atheist aesthetic which i found to be similarly dumbed down and basic and in its 76 second run time i failed to see what polluted paradise really brings to this track list that no other song doesn't already to some degree these songs attention grabbing synced up drum and riff pattern sounds like a watered-down version of what they had already done on fear as a fossil i guess the squealing guitar leads toward the end are pretty interesting but not enough to make me want to come back at the very end of the album is where we get its two longest songs blood blossom and shadow of life the former of the two being the most typical piece of death core on this entire record so much so if it weren't for jacob bannon's muffled screams all over this track i would have no leads whatsoever as to who is even involved with this and while i don't usually endorse the instrumental wankery of a lot of the more technical deathcore bands out there at least a group in that style would be working more detail into the drums and guitars finally with the closer we actually get some impressive dynamics being worked into a song spanning past the three-minute mark dramatic and heavy verse riffs on this thing a lot of grim harmonies too bannon's vocals are certainly brutal enough from here we transition into an engaging and fluid series of guitar passages and drum patterns a really cool ghoulish outro solo too it might be the most metal and anthemic cut on the entire record and somehow it is the better for it to sum up my feelings on this record though it's okay it's not bad but not mind-blowing either certainly it's novel to hear this group of guys making this type of record but my interest in this lp doesn't really expand beyond that and a handful of highlights more often than i expected these songs on this thing rode the line between being typical and just somewhat boring which is kind of amazing though considering how short the record actually is feeling a strong five to a light six on this one tran position have you given this album a listen did you love it did you

SWiRwPkHU8o,hi everyone basically tanana here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new car seat headrest album making a door less open hey hey over here you mean like this like Nick yeah but keep going perfect this is the latest full-length LP from singer multi-instrumentalist and songwriter we'll Toledo's car seat headrest one of the most buzzed-about music acts to break off of the band camp circuit car seat has been lovingly devoted to the Matador label ever since the middle of the 2010s and the music has gotten better and better the massive increase in recording quality and fidelity shown on teens of style the amazing transition from teens of style to teens of denial one of the most ambitious and top-notch indie rock records of the past decade recently we also had the triumphant redo of a once low five fan favorite twin fantasy back in 2018 which for some reason in my memory feels like it just came out I wasn't expecting to hear back from Will Toledo so soon especially with such a peculiar single back in February can't cool me down it presented a pretty significant change of pace for will sound and mind you in concept and not against will going more electronic or indie tronic he certainly wouldn't be the first songwriter to do so but generally I'm not really into how unrefined and skeletal the composition on this track is nor how dry and unscoped the sounds are regardless of the style of music will is going for on this track it still just sounds like a demo which is an odd characterization to make of wills music I know because usually his records have a bit of an amateurish and blemished Flair but to reference teens of denial just because the recording on that record is a little distorted a little rough around the edges that doesn't mean that the performances and the instrumentals aren't dynamic that the songs aren't sharp and focused that the vocals aren't captivating because they certainly are however I'm having a hard time paying those same compliments to the material on wills new effort here to take it back again to can't cool me down while I think the song and hook at the core of this track are fine there's very little about these bare and stark synthesizers and vocals that propels the the songwriting and there are similarly underwhelming songs elsewhere on the LP too for one there must be more than blood my mind starts trailing off before we even get to the halfway point on this 7-minute track and once again it's not really anything against the song as the core of the track but the Gong Gong Gong Gong synth lines along with the very rigid and stiff beat that backs most of the track it really kind of puts a damper on the linear and somewhat epic build will is trying to work into the song this build is deflated by this rhythmic backbone that makes the whole thing just feel stagnant meanwhile the style of a track like Martin is very much more in car seat headrests usual style we have some spunky guitar chords kind of punchy drumbeats a sweet power pop hook as well easily this track could have slipped into the tracklist of teens of style without anybody batting an eye but is it one of my favorite car seat songs not necessarily there's also deadlines which is another rock-oriented cut in the tracklist but this one feels like we'll playing a bit of musical cosplay creating a song that's like a hybrid of The Strokes and a heavy blaring alt-rock chorus you see it's new but not necessarily abnormal in some respects the instrumental on this one is a bit too regimented but it's still one of these sharper and more well groomed songs on the record for sure even if it's not the type of sound I seek in a car seat headrests song but the most out of character moment on the entire LP hands down goes to Hollywood God how did we end up here what is this crummy faux edgy 2000s garage centric rock with a garish chorus why this sounds like the sort of thing Beck would have done back in his prime but to like charity this like with a really big funny nudge in a wink that doesn't really seem to come through much on on this I'm just waiting for out another the creative flair of the track or the interesting spin he puts on it to hit me and it's just not it just sounds like exactly the type of rock music I would just usually not want to listen to and there's just so much of this track that feels overkill and dumbed down what's funny is this is not even the weirdest moment on the entire record for one we have the him remix which features all of these revving and somewhat abrasive electronics that are met with these vocal chops of will singing just calling out very dramatically the intro sounds like part of a black dice song but then we get all of these pounding rhythms and guitar solos cycling noises and flashy synth lines it's a weird hybrid of rock and organ and electronics pretty daring actually in terms of its build up of different sounds and styles and it reaches a pretty fantastic climax to the progression the pacing of the track is actually really engaging more engaging than some of the more I guess conventional songs here really I do like the track it's a cool unexpected turn but there's nothing else really on this album that is reinforcing it and that is pretty much the case for everything else here - it's like every new song presents another hard left turn hard right turn it's a total crapshoot in terms of are we gonna get a good song a bad song a rock song an electronic song some weird bunch of sounds coalescing chaotically there are other tracks here I would point out as highlights like weightlifters which i think is a really killer intro deadlines thoughtful the other deadlines on the record later on the album I thought was another standout moment despite it being another big change of pace for will instrumentally here it feels like he is giving a big big big nod to the synth waves onra with all these driving beats and buzzing cinematic synth chords that are a bit of a throwback he even works in this tiny little Crystal Castles ish synth lead toward the midpoint of the track that's actually pretty sharp the tone of the song is moody but it is still incredibly catchy and the final leg of the track presents a solid climax too but again despite this being a decent highlight there isn't anything else on the record that reinforces this it's it's really just almost randomized it's like will underwent some kind of challenge on this record where he had to write a different song of a different style that was chosen for him by some kind of AI or something the lack of cohesion direction and inability to make all of these ideas coalesce in a meaningful way I think is embodied in the closing track famous everything about this instrumental from the beats to the effects to the senses just clashing to my ears and Will's somewhat sung somewhat spoken vocals aren't really bringing it all together either in fact the way he's saying things like please let somebody care about this please let somebody care about this over these throbbing synthesizers makes me feel like he's trying to engage in some kind of meta commentary on this project and his music current day also as he's a repeating change or mind change your mind is is is he morphing and morphing into David Byrne himself right before our very ears on this song why yeah despite enjoying a good handful of songs on this record it really is a mess not only are a lot of tracks here just not up to snuff when it comes to Wells usual quality level of songwriting and instrumentation whether that be on the production side the performance side or the composition side not really seeing what the sudden embrace of electronics and since on this project brought to the table either outside of maybe a few tracks Will's going to have to get a little bit more ambitious and adventurous if he's going to pull this off because embarking on a bunch of experiments that go awry I don't even think is making a doors biggest issue the most glaring problem on this record for me is that a lot of the songs and instrumentals just feel kind of half-baked and unrefined so really for me it comes down to just there being a lot of untapped potential here I'm a decent two strong five on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my

GHkJpVTe568,hi everyone Matheny checked Hanna no you're the internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new elder album omens Massachusetts metal and heavy psych outfit elder they are back with their fifth full-length LP here which follows a pretty acclaimed series of albums thus far the band's dead roots stirring record is easily one of the most celebrated releases of the past decade when it comes to metal fans who love their stuff heavy slow a little trippy too progressive is another term I would use to describe the band's music at least some of it certainly the more ambitious song structures and expanded instrumental passages on their last full length LP reflections of a floating world previously elder wouldn't necessarily be a band I'd refer to as a prog rock band but this style of music is no longer taking a backseat in Elders sound as it's now more broadly informing most portions of the five tracks delivered on this new LP now of course it's not a total replacement for the heavier and more psych oriented elements of Elders style but the band's definitely spending less time spacing out too gnarly riffs and righteous solos and now seem much more content to be calculating these multi-phased maze-like song structures now in concept this is cool this is fine especially since the band was already dabbling in this a little bit on reflections where they certainly showed that they could take fans on these grand musical excursions and still keep it pretty heavy pretty visceral but just to show how much further the band has gone into this sound on the track in procession I can't say I saw the Harmonized analog synth and guitar solos coming nor some of the very obvious Pink Floyd worship in the second half during this groovy instrumental passage it is a little derivative but I guess I can't say too many negative things about it just that I'm not really blown away by the playing or the progressions as elder doesn't try to come off too flashy I guess I suppose that they did that might have gotten in the way of them effectively balancing out the prog ear sections and sounds with the heavier more stoner metal influenced bits which which I think they do pretty effectively especially during the first section of the opening track omens where we get this absolutely thunderous righteous riff touched up with these watery fantastical leads and funny little wah-wah synth bits as well also some really base and grand chord shifts hanging in the background making the whole thing just sound larger-than-life honestly some of the portions of this track do remind me of the band Baroness a little bit but if they had favoured like slower tempos and slightly more psychedelic sound palettes the mid point of the song is a bit of a lull but I think that is at least partially made up for by the crushing ending which features all these synced up riffs and drums just going at it it's a great start to the LP and honestly the best song the album has to offer but the influences that course through this tracks veins don't always manifest in the best way on the following cuts the whole first portion of the track Halcyon is just dead on arrival it just sounds like some really jangly bland post-rock like some early maguire something but with way less personality the track isn't really at its best until the Mellotron passages in the second half where the song suddenly gains at least some sort of grace the soaring and harmonized solo passages that follow this are a fantastic payoff too but not enough to make me want to come back and withstand that drab intro the track embers was a teaser to this album that I did not like on first listen and getting more familiar with it in the record itself I still do not care for it mostly because of one key factor the vocals got the singing on this track stinks they're not just weak generally speaking they are embarrassing for a band who up until this point their their vocal work has been pretty decent sure that doubled up in bellowing roars on a dead roots stirring aren't exactly groundbreaking or anything but they did they did the thing they got the job done meanwhile all the portions of embers that see Nicholas DeSalvo reaching into his upper register are very difficult to listen to now having said that you can't count the vocals against this record too much I guess as there are so many portions on the thing that just featured no vocals at all and even when the vocals are here they're not mixed all that high either the it's it's clear the band doesn't necessarily want them to be the most vocal of points in the mix but if you do choose to home in on them as you're listening to these tracks you will notice right away they're not all that good and it's pretty impossible not to focus on them on this track because they are particularly prominent here truly the vocals do create a situation for me where it is difficult to finish and enjoy this song and to be frank the singing isn't that much better on the previous tracks we then have the closing track on the LP one light retreating the singing also sits very prominently in the mix here and it is also not all that good especially considering how they sit against these relentlessly noodley guitar passages winding and winding and tangling underneath in such a way where not much is really translating from them so now even some of the instrumental ideas are kind of falling apart thankfully the second half of this track is a lot more intriguing than the first there are some passages here that are actually quite beautiful we get more weepy Mellotron not anything new in the album at this point but still a nice change of pace in this particular composition that then expands into some very hypnotic and mellow guitar passages that eventually lead us to a pretty heavy and epic finish and that's the whole record I am so torn because there are portions of this LP that I think are quite good there are moments where I think the more progressive elements meld wonderfully with the stoner and encyc sounds but simultaneously there are a lot of spots here that I think instrumentally and compositionally could have been a lot more ambitious could have been a lot more muscular in terms of performance and play and yeah while I did discount their importance on the record a little bit earlier it is tough to ignore just how bad the vocals are they don't entirely ruin every song on the record but there are some spots here especially on the last two tracks that are made unlistenable because of them beyond that I'm not against the idea of Eldar going in this stylistic direction but I guess remember that shadow of the Bands you are pulling from on this LP looms long and looms dark and for the most part I feel like this record does kind of get lost in that darkness feeling a decent too strong five on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you

back so a shout out to cult crimes and the new EP which is linked down below try it for yourself and also Frank jab see who's come through with a quality little EP this I love hating you project which the the the title track the lead track off of that is is quite good I think is actually one of Frank's best songs hands down point blank period the hook really bursts on this one and it feels like one of his most self-serious songs - so good - listen give it a try alright let's get into the worst tracks this week of which there were a lot there were a lot of bad songs this week and there were some other songs this week that I'm sure some of you enjoy but uh for reasons that I will go into they rubbed me the wrong way personally okay let's go let's see first off yg laugh now cry later new single very very very utterly boring under-produced not a strong hook either this is a total throw away of a track have no idea why he released it I suppose his vocals are kind of intimate on the song which is not bad because yg does have a voice that I like he does have a personality but this is not one of his best performances so without a strong beat or a chorus to carry that there's not really a whole lot to this song moving on from there SIA saved my life is the name of this new cut over here and I was utterly disappointed by it I think it is one of her most generically written songs in a while and on top of it the vocals on the chorus aren't even really that great actually one of her less flattering vocal performances in my view on top of that the verses are sort of like that stereotypical very subdued under-delivered type of pop verses that only exists to bore you into a lull just so the hook feels like it's hitting harder than it actually is that is a quality about CEA's of music in the in the past that I have commended her for sort of avoiding I thought that you know she was kind of above this very thin and cheap you know sort of pop song trope but she is dabbled in it here for whatever reason moving out from their new track from Remo Drive the band is still not really bouncing back from a lot of the quality material on their debut I feel like they're really almost in no-man's land at this point especially on this track over here star worship which i think is one of the blander songs I have heard from them thus far I feel like the further we go with Remo Drive the more we just trend into very bland indie rock unfortunately we also have a new track from Machine Gun Kelly MGK is going in a bit of a rock direction with the song kind of a pop rock and pop punk thing it's not incredibly good and the vocals are actually very unflattering the instrumental is generic and boring for a song that is supposed to have a bit of an edge to it there's not really a whole lot of bite to anything that is going on here so yeah pretty drab we also have this new song from higham I wanted to like it so much I know alone but the instrumental on this thing is so skeletal and redundant the beat actually gets a little annoying after a while and on top of it the the the sisters of Hyams sisters their vocals are so heavily processed on this song to the point where that it just sounds alien a robotic it's not a great sound it's not a great sound and I don't think it's one of their stronger songs either first track from this new LP I was truly and honestly disappointed by but out of so far nothing else is sounded like this so I guess you know there's there's that but this is certainly a song that I will be skipping once this record drops glass animals speaking of vocal processing this track features even worse vocal processing the vocals just are manipulated to the point where they sound utterly soulless not only that but the instrumental like the title sort of suggests is dreamy but it is dreamy without much in the way of textural or sonic exploration it's just a lot of bland and uneventful sounds you know it's it's it's more not so much dreamy but just putting me to sleep in a very unflattering way we also have French Montana Tory Lanez Tori's performance on this track is not all that bad but this is one of French is more embarrassing songs if you ask me because his flow and delivery sounds absolutely silly the beat is pretty much a throwaway as well but I guess kudos to French for keeping it up despite of sounding foolish in that weird little tiff that he had with the internet over whether or not he has more hits than Kendrick Lamar which is ridiculous we also have a new tract from lil baby as well as 42 Doug we paid which is just a very tuneless annoying generic piece of auto crooned trap it's very much a throw away as well let's get into the tracks that I thought were met not terrible but not blowing you away either you may enjoy them a little bit more than me let's go one we have a track from Shu Shu off of a a new various artists said let's just put it out to put it out type of compilation from I believe a a group that manages tours and performances for a lot of artists on the European side of things and Shu Shu just happens to be a part of that group and took part in releasing a track on this compilation and I swallow the moon is the cut I'm not super crazy about the instrumental but Jamie's performance here vocally is pretty dramatic so you know check it out we have also a new track from big thief a lot of qualities of the writing of this song especially in the chords at certain points reminds me of like a classic Beatles track but to love in mind it's a cool piece of indie folk with with some pretty ideas and kradic vocals moving on from there we also have Lovers Lane this track from an artist that I have just recently been turned on to his name is Pilar E if you are a huge emo trap or emo rap fan this is kind of the song for you it is a very moody piece of I guess I guess synthetic Bedroom produced emo music with you know kind of those classics somewhat mathy guitars hanging in the background but there are elements of hip-hop influence coming through in the production it's a really cool blend of again emo and hip-hop but it leans a bit more on the emo side I will say that I do wish the song changed up a bit more but but still we also have a new track from Metz they put out a new single over here acid is the name of this track it is wild it is relentless it is harsh it is abrasive like a good piece of noise rock should be the vocals and the writing aren't the best I've ever heard you know Metz's never really stood out to me in that way but if you're looking for something really cathartic during this point in time give it a try give it a shot we also have BQ eco to the friend Joey badass and boss surprisingly it is boss in my opinion who sort of comes out ahead lyrically and vocally on this one but still I thought this was a somewhat mild piece of jazz infused trap it's it's okay you know if you're familiar with these three guys you know they care about their lyrics and they care about their flows and everything and you know they care about their their pen game and all that so they certainly put effort on that front but you know I'm not saying this is like the best I've ever heard from from these three guys but still bosses not the one I thought was gonna come out ahead I easily I would have thought it would be Joey but in my opinion it really was boss moving on from there we have a new new new new new song also from Miss Jess Williamson whose tracks I have been tracking from her forthcoming record smoke is the name of this new one it's it's easily my least favorite of all this heater tracks so far and that's mostly because the song I felt was pretty forgettable and instrumentally it wasn't nearly as creative or as out there as everything she has been teasing toward this album with so far but who knows maybe this somewhat low-key number will grow on me when I hear in the context of the entire album we also have Drake over here Drake shoutout to Drake he has that new demos project out that I will be reviewing very soon Payne 1993 with playboy cardi is sort of the cut everybody has been talking about in the wake of it dropping because that song has been anticipated discussed fans have been wondering when they're going to end up hearing it and the like with a to see slide it's a little under produced stylistically Drake is borrowing a lot from playboy cardies aesthetic on this one but I think he does a pretty decent job and meanwhile playboy cardi's feature kind of stinks it's not that good he sounds like a cut-rate young thug on the track in my opinion should have kept that one in the vaults we also have doji cat with say so the remix featuring Nicki Minaj which has created quite a bit of pandemonium on the Internet and you know I understand why I mean to have a Nicki and dosha crossing over is pretty fantastic but still having said that the song is okay just as it was previously say so is not a bad single but having said that Nicki's inclusion is just like painfully tacked on like the beat just drops and it turns to this very simple plain like hi-hat sort of pattern and then from there Nicki does her thing but then meanwhile like nothing of the original track is really there it's like just it's like the the track got cut and she just got copied and pasted into a section of it and then the rest of the song goes on almost as normal it's I don't know kind of lazy in that sense I'll say lazy I feel like if Nicki was going to be included in this song they could have done a better job of weaving her in in a more cohesive way to where she just doesn't feel like an afterthought moving on from there we have a new track once more from the Dixie Chicks not as crazy about this one as I was the lead single which I thought was easily one of their best songs to date this other one over here is a bit more of a ballad a lot more low-key Julianne rather yet Julianne calm down again doesn't hit hard as the first taste of the new record but certainly by no means bad leagues better than a lot of terrible pop country out there we also have another track from the music project I've talked about in this series before disheveled cus oh my god is the name of the song and yeah it's it's not all that bad it's a decent piece of I suppose old school indie rock with some angular and interesting guitar work in it I'm not super crazy about the tune or the vocals certainly not as crazy as I was about those factors in the last single to drop but they're not terrible you know if you've got a bit of a nostalgia for this era of music and you want to hear maybe some more ambitious guitars thrown into the mix give it a shot we also have have have have have this new track over here from none other than bad bad not good the Canadian jazz outfit is back with a very moody piece of I guess kind of pop kind of jazz it's a little dreamy as well they're elements of it that reminded me of the band wild beasts but again with with like a stronger jazz influence there are a lot of elements to it that I liked especially on the instrumental side but I just felt the vocals and especially the vocal harmonies that were working to the song we're super super super weak really needed to be retooled I will say that alright moving on from there next next next we have ARCA back with a new single just just realizing now that is that is like a badass like metal claw on our cos arm right there that's that's lit but anyway ARCA has hit us with a new song a new track over here titled non-binary and the production is absolutely wild I love that quality about the the new single over here in Arcis as seen fit to change the pace a little bit on this as she is rapping on this track at various points and there are even a few lines where the the vocals border on spoken word a little bit and I do like how self-affirming the vocals are but I will say that the lyrics really could use some work I could see where she's coming from with them and then what she is trying to portray with them but the I they really could have used some retooling I think some of the bars kind of rough next we have a track from amber Marc 1894 which is a pretty funny track about essentially turning down men's advances but like in a club setting but the way the whole video is shot it's like clearly shot and sort of directed under quarantine so like why anybody would be in the club in those conditions I don't know but it anyway it's it's just kind of a funny quality about the track I will say the beat is great a lot of the vocals are good although I do think the the the the concept the title the lyrics of the song I think are a bit heavy-handed in the the message they're trying to deliver but still it's pretty catchy and will certainly lead me to keep my ear to the ground for whatever Amber's doing from here all right let's move on to the tracks that I thought were the best this week which we have a handful of first off we have this new track from the band proto martyr which is titled worm in heaven it is a slow burner it is moody it is sad it is clearly influenced by the likes of Nick Cave as well give it a try give it a shot it's certainly fitting for the times we are currently in we also have a new track over here rather a remix from Megan the stallion for savage which is one of the better tracks off of her recent EP and now it features Beyonce and Beyonce's appearance is quite good and to contrast with say so she actually like kind of complements the song really well and sounds like she's in the track not just randomly thrown in but yeah hell yes - this fucking remix moving on from there we have Lucy Dacus singer/songwriter doing a Yo La Tengo cover of Tom Courtenay and it's a quite a good rendition you know it's it's low key on our guitar in what I assume is her apartment you know and nothing in terms of like huge production value or anything but it's it's still a good a still a good rendition we also have linguae egg nota doing a cover of Dolly Parton's Jolene in the intense destructive amazing way that you would probably imagine she would it's it's great it is immense and I will say nothing more than that we have Jesse Lanza over here with this new track face which I'm digging quite a bit because I think this is one of the most fantastically produced Jesse Lanza songs of all time it's really jittery I'm loving the house grooves as well it's it's a little out there I'm digging it quite a bit and you know the vocals aren't too bad either so I've give it a try give it a shot we also have the the band Hines over here who hails from Spain I believe just like the kids is the name of their newest single over here and I am loving it now in the past Hines music has always been very grating to me a bit of a turn-off because the recording quality of their stuff was just like just a little too low Phi I felt like they did a great job of upping the fidelity a little bit on this track while still kind of maintaining that rough around the edges you know we're just a band of friends making some fun music type of vibe which again I thought was a really good and and the song isn't bad either the song was actually quite good in my opinion so uh you know I feel like this is a high ends kind of really reaching a creative balance here a very good one in my view all right moving on from there a gorilla's song machine newest output from that is this track featuring the late Tony Allen and also Skepta how far it's got some amazing production on it as well while it doesn't really have the presence of Damon Albarn's voice which I would have liked to some degree it still is another great piece of music from the song machine series so uh gorillas continue to kill it I also want to give a shout out to this track from Bell Witch and Ariel ruin heaven torn low the toll which is a fantastically depressing droney piece of doom metal really mournful as well and certainly has me looking forward to more tracks from this crossover into the future and that is going to be it for the weekly track round up everyone thank you very much for watching hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this video and I will see you in the next one Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever 
ugJucHACZr8,yeah hi everyone friendship fry here the internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new dance gavin dance album afterburner this is the newest full-length lp from post hardcore and math rock outfit dance gavin dance they are now on their ninth album and 15th year and over that course of time the band has proven to have some pretty impressive staying power though personally the band's saccharine progressive and dizzying brand of post hardcore never really spoke to me for as long as i've known about them i made that much known when i did a review of dance gavin dance's 2015 record instant gratification the response to my review on that one was pure pandemonium really i just found the album to be incredibly grating and needlessly busy look i do love a lot of early math rock but i don't see what this very gimmicky guitar wankery brings to uh this semi-sweet post-hardcore sound not only that but i couldn't really get into the band's vocal dynamics either hardcore screams set against soaring cleans is a pretty tried-and-true formula at this point but dance gavin dance's insistence on infusing uh the cleanly sung vocals with like this angelic level of sterility is just so tacky to my ears i also can't help but roll my eyes when the band suddenly breaks into a watered-down take on another genre that's outside of their usual wheelhouse wow let's do a hip-hop verse ooh some funky licks now look in dance gavin dance's defense they did tone down a lot of that silliness on their 2016 record mothership which in my opinion is actually one of dance gavin dance's better and more tasteful releases and while i wasn't as crazy about it i did think their 2018 follow-up artificial selection was relatively low bs as well the mathrock guitars actually flow a lot more coherently on this one many of the hooks actually pop and on top of it the singing as well feels a bit more organic the cleans balance out a lot better with the screams i did see this album as a big improvement on instant gratification when it dropped but it did take me a while to really appreciate how much better it is than many other albums in their discography too to be honest though i was hesitant to say anything overly negative about this lp the year that it dropped because so many fans hated the instant gratification review for obvious reasons i just felt that uh my take they would have gotten nothing out of it anyway but still for whatever reason i have gotten a lot of requests from fans to talk about dgd's a new lp over here and uh morbid curiosity got the better of me as well and i admit i was a little disappointed because i was hoping the band would come to an even greater sense of maturity and fluidity in their songs post mothership but it seems they are actually just up to their old tricks again on afterburner for one the cleans somehow sound even more processed than they ever were in the past right now to the point where they they come off almost alien look at the vocal harmonies on one in a million it's like i'm listening to fleet foxes but uh if the vocals were all like uh synthetically generated ais and once again we get a lot of soulless math leads that uh sound like random calculations of uh tonal nonsense to be fair these are not all over the album but it's literally the first sound you hear when you hit play on the thing this type of guitar work colors numerous tracks on this record sometimes hanging in the background sometimes working as a transitional point like on strawberry's wake and once more we get a lot of ridiculous and unflattering genre excursions where the band sounds like a fish out of water like on calentimiento global which is an attempt at a latin and post-hardcore blend which might be tolerable if not for the weirdly chipmunk background vocals sounding obnoxious as hell yeah it's pretty gimmicky and some of the rapping returns as well on the closing track where you can actually hear some trap beats yes i wanted some trap on this and and i got some trap i i really got some trap climb that ladder ass don't matter drip mad hatta watch it burn cutting zanz in a space station also those funky synth back passages on parody catharsis and and what is that vocal break oh i got a leg up i killed the whole game and i'm fed up and with those soaring clean vocals with the don't wanna be a shoulder to cry on don't turn the light on don't tell me your name what in holy linkin park is this even more perplexing than this is the hook on the track three wishes multiple stab wounds yeah which seems a little overly dramatic for a song that uh is is about like a relationship falling apart some groovy alt-rock bass fuzzy garage guitars and a middle section that sounds like some watered down portugal the man are just some of the disparate ideas that make up the total uh mess that is parallels it's like we're trying to transition on this one as quickly as we can from one half-hearted idea to the next so in these respects unfortunately the band hasn't really improved on after burner uh but that's not to say that there aren't some highlights on here there kind of are though i would much rather prefer to listen to any number of amazing screamo bands that i've talked about on this channel over the years uh many of the screamo passages on this record aren't all that bad i would also say the chorus on lyrics lie pops pretty well too it was real real nice to meet you hope you learned what i had to teach you not to mention the synced up riffs and double bass drums between the hooks are pretty thunderous and heavy visceral structurally i would say this is one of the more coherent songs on the album too night sway stands out as maybe being the heaviest track on the entire record the riffs are pretty bassy and massive and that opening is just killer and you have to kind of admire the seething hatred radiating off of the lyrics on born to fail maybe i'm not deep enough into the dance gavin dance lore i i don't know what kind of scenester beef has caused the lyrics on this track but they are a petty yes but also pretty pretty gutsy uh to be called out this hard damn look overall i i felt this album was not nearly as hard to stand as instant gratification but uh the band's upward trajectory they were building on mothership i feel like has very much crumbled under the weight of afterburner unfortunately feeling a strong three to a light four on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is

o_dycSOZtm8,hi everyone chocolate and raisins here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new quake Chris and Chris Keys album innocent country - this is a new collaboration album between Chris Keys California producer and Kweli Chris Detroit rapper this of course is not the first time they have crossed paths creatively as back in 2015 they released a innocent country the first one which in my view is one of the odder projects in Chris's ever-growing discography which is saying something because Chris isn't exactly your average MC he has a uniquely congested tone of voice very laid-back delivery lyrics that deal mostly in social commentary introspection absurd humor and he'll often go into an album with a loose focus on the topics at hand or the instrumental aesthetics of the record how those all work together maybe not so closely it becomes a concept but just enough to where each one of his albums has a distinctly different personality Kweli has also been in my opinion on a creative streak as of late putting out some of his best and most well-received material to date guns being you as great also everything is fine the collaboration he dropped with his significant other the criminally underrated Jean Grey but given that innocent country 2 is an unexpected sequel to an album in the quail egg Chris discography maybe we're not in for a change of pace here maybe we are going to hear something that is just like that original record it is a sequel after all no not the case wrong wrong wrong wrong like I said earlier in the review innocent country the original one is one of the more left-field records in Chris's catalogue with all of these warped backdrops of soul and jazz supporting this short series of sometimes cartoonish surreal impressionistic songs but in many ways innocent country 2 is vastly different for one I think innocent country 2 is of a slightly higher fidelity the instrumental sound a lot richer especially those jazz pianos the attitude on this record is a lot more acted to and with that it's worth noting that innocent country 2 is also a much more self-serious project quell a sharp sense of humour does show up at some key points here especially on the intro montage of clips that are supposed to I guess catch up the audience on innocent country so far though it's just like a weird series of hilarious snippets but generally speaking innocent country 2 isn't nearly as weird or as funny as qualies records tend to be there is also quite a bit more singing on this record especially from Chris who given his rap voice you might assume is a terrible singer but his vocals actually aren't too bad they do appeal in a certain weirdo soul type of way especially on tracks like black Twitter as well as sudden death innocent country - in my view might be a little long and difficult to sum up topically but still this is quali at his most somber as well as mellow sometimes those dour feelings lead to some powerful moments and other times not quite as much like when qualies verse comes up short toward the end of sacred safe where his vocals aren't really holding that strong of a tune nor are his lyrics as interesting or as multi-layered as his features before him plus the jazz instrumental on this one feels like something flying Lotus or Madlib would do if they were trying to play it as straight and as bland as possible I mean the pianos are great but there's not really much else about the beat texturally that is gripping there are also points on the LP where the features don't really stun all that much either like with pink sifu on grease from the elbows where I think he plays it a bit more understated than he needed to there's also make it better featuring Starr Busby who from the looks of it looks like a very trained and seasoned singer but she spends a good deal of her feature pulling off these very weak neo-soul riffs that sound like Erykah Badu on not her best day there's the kind of meandering horizon which I think drags on a bit as well it feels like a track from one of Chris's older records but not with nearly as much ex tricity or instrumental flavor to compensate for how redundant and low structure the song is these are my least favorite moments on this record by far but thankfully they're not all that bad and there is a hefty heap of highlights throughout the rest of the album we have the sad and captivating honest which is loaded with these glamorous and depressing pianos warm bass it's not too much unlike a lot of the jazzier cuts off guns and this instrumental serves as a great foundation for Chris to deliver one heartbroken verse after another as he details this romance that just went awry the bitterness the betrayal the mind games the manipulation it's poetic its thoughtful and it finishes with a funny phone message at the end too we also have the equally classy and luscious living happy which is tagged with these thick and beautiful vocal harmonies along with these refrains that are mentioning in succession all of these old dances as lyrical equally begins to go down memory lane talking about what his life used to be and speaking of throwing it back bottle black power buy the business instrumentally and vocally sounds like something off of chris's ghost at the finish line record maybe it's him playing up his nasal voice or the funny overdub flows on the hook or even how quirky and eerie the beat sounds sure it is one of the funnier sounding tracks on the LP but still it works as an excellent piece of social commentary on those who may want to profit off of pro-black politics which is one of a few afro centric moments on the LP especially the family focused ritual where Chris makes room on the record to tribute some of his loved ones let me also make note of the incredible tracks that finish up the back end of this thing graphic bleed outs the beat on this thing is so gorgeous I want to fucking cry god damn the keys are so wonderful the harmonies they are lovely and the sound of this beat seems to inspire Chris quite a bit as well his voice is the most animated it is on the entire LP his delivery even borders on theatrical at points which is surprising given how low-key he typically plays it and he treats us to some of the most evocative wordplay and word choice on the entire LP as well don't let him sell your soul and stay faithful loving in grief let it out and if need be let it be don't blow with the winds wherever's and what's some openings never shut once one delivers the cut with this and a good vocal performance from merrill Garbus of tune-yards fame and some killer flute solos as well it's one of my favorite songs of the year we also have Mirage which is an immense song featuring contributions from Denmark Vesey Earl Sweatshirt it is a seven-minute monster with pained group vocals dreary pianos a powerful monologue at the finish - it's got the power of a posse cut but then also the tenderness of a funeral eulogy when you fall is also an awesome moment of finality for the LP in my opinion some decent features there as well and overall I felt this was a very good record from Kweli Chris and Chris key is very very very very good in fact there were a few spots that were either underwhelming or felt just a bit unambitious for cuale the album is topically scattered to a slight degree I felt but some of Chris's best work does show up on this album there are a whole lot of features but a vast majority of them are quite good and Chris Keys production is nothing to sneeze at either yeah I do think it's a little too pristine on the first leg of the record but consistently it is mature tasteful with wonderful touches of jazz and soul all over while this is not my favorite quali Chris record I still see it very much as a part of the current creative winning streak that he is on feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this one transition did you give this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Kweli Chris Chris keys for 
x0GzWxPJQUs,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new lead open Yenta record miss Colombia this is the sophomore full-length LP of Toronto via Columbia singer and songwriter Leto pimienta this record comes a few years after her pulling a surprise win for the Polaris Music Prize for her debut album la pop asa that project while rough-around-the-edges still had a lot of cool elements flowing through it since an art pop neo psych fault music but all of it had this profoundly Latin twist while they weren't the most cleanly crafted songs of 2016 some really bold ideas wrung through the dense and chaotic layers of synths and effects and vocals but now Leto is taking a profoundly different approach to the songwriting and production on Miss Colombia you'll find a similar balance of influences and styles on this record sure but there is a newfound clarity to the songwriting and production just an impressive laser focus that was not present on the debut and not only has this resulted in a huge improvement in Leto sound but also one of the most forward-thinking latin records that i've heard in the past couple years cuz there are gorgeous stunning wondrous and well arranged tracks all over this thing like the beautiful simplicity of the opener para transfer beer which has the sweeping theatrical vocal lines set to these wonderful layers of horn harmonies it kind of sounds like something out of like a classic Bjork record this is a grand enchanting and enticing start to this LP but it's not the full view of what it has to offer this is not just some standard art pop affair which you might get the impression of just by listening to this we instantly transition away from that style on SOT kou haces the intros distant lead vocals sound effects and odd choppy samples read like something out of the start of an animal collective song but soon we're hit with all of these digitized indigenous rhythms which set a very meditative tone Lido's beautiful voice just slices through this very Spacey mix even on the thunderous hook which is packed with fuzzy bass and these honking horn sections absolutely what we're hearing here is electronic pop through and through but leader does such an excellent job of maintaining the roots of the Columbia music that's inspiring what she's doing what's also inspiring her music when we dig into the lyrics is her experience as an indigenous woman who views herself as being a part of this rich cultural and musical tradition solido continues exploring these sounds and ideas throughout the tracklist in various ways on the track nada I don't think I've heard a sharper combo of cumbia and art pop in my life the track is painted with these quirky synthetic rhythms and slightly dubby vocal effects - booming bass and horns once again provide an amazing backbone for the song and the mysterious synth leads and vocal harmonies that top all of this are just so lush damn it's like I'm listening to a cerebral explosion of pastels and neons while on the following track Ledo gives an excellent vocal performance over even more eccentric horns and some steel drums - uh and she sounds like an angel on this song it's it's just great it's fantastic and the the instrumentation is so well balanced as well even with the bass booming and just rumbling as hard as it is the the the sound of these tracks they're so well engineered I also ended up loving the very textured punchy and odd beats on the track no poo day even though the song here is much more dramatic than any number of tracks on this album there's something about the rhythms that reminded me of the type of rhythmic textures and Tambor's that you would get out of like an early mi a record meanwhile once again the Bjork influence creeps in once again on some of the melodies and songwriting but it's not entirely a bad thing as the way all of these ideas coalesce especially with Leto's personality her personal story and her vocal style it creates a pretty singular experience it's not derivative I'm not trying to make that case here so as far as flow goes thus far the album really is cooking with gas but it's past this point that we reach a really odd moment in the tracklist coming through is another piece akin to the intro on the record where we have Ledo weaving her singing into these layers of horns but now also some reads - it's a very elegant moment on the record but still feels a bit transitional I wish it progressed to a larger climax then immediately after this we hit a spoken-word passage from veteran of the Colombian music scene Raphael Cassie on e cos e on e someone who has been covered quite extensively in the western music press by any journalist who is looking for some kind of insight into the afro-colombian scene and while yeah it does disrupt the flow of the record it is a bit lengthy and it's not a song from a music nerd standpoint it is a pretty interesting piece as Cassie Ani does his best to explain how he got involved in the music scene and the generational passing of the torch as it were when it comes to this very communal style of music now this whole piece is just a preface for the next song on the album where Leto seems to lead a jam with Cassie on a sextet otavalo it's a six minute number that's presented in a very raw fashion for me the first experience with this track was a bit jarring because it sticks out like a sore thumb in the tracklist not to say I'm totally unfamiliar with the style of music that's going on here but it was odd to hear a woven in so abruptly into this batch of songs it's clear and admirable that she doesn't want the more indigenous side of her sound to fall on deaf ears so she is trying to illustrate that with this interesting bit of musical anthropology regardless of how alike it sounds - everything that came before it it is an interesting performance I mean me call-and-response vocals and the really great rhythms and drums and the wild energy of the whole thing is fantastic again it could have been incorporated into the tracklist and in a way that was maybe a bit smoother but I still like its presence on the record especially as Ledo embarks on another track after this one the scratches a similar itch sans the sextet oh of course where once again we get a lot of rustic vocal harmonies hand drums but now all presented with much cleaner production the ending of the record overall is pretty strong with resist oh yeah more sharp songwriting essentially set to very quirky and colorful digitized cumbia rhythms I would absolutely love love love love love to hear more tracks from her in this style in the future and the closing track is essentially a lunar version of the melodies and lyrics explored on the intro cut but now with more of an emphasis on vocal harmonies as opposed to horns which I felt was a pretty thoughtful way to close the record out especially with these themes of transcribing coming back into view in the lyrics which makes me wonder if there is at all an intention there to make a statement on Lido's attempts to transcribe transfer translate the influences of those who came before her and the way she has kind of recontextualized that into this new art pop ish hybrid of sounds regardless of the narrative on that track that is actually what she is doing on this record and doing so incredibly well with again great songs great vocal performances great production and I can't praise this record enough even if the flow of the whole thing and the way certain ideas or tracks were presented when they were presented wasn't necessarily the most ideal I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the Bell is well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Beto pimienta forever 
L1ClMFpPGro,this glenn danzig record it's not good hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is but do you know Danzig legendary songwriter vocalist he has come out with some amazing music over the years his first handful of solo records are fantastic the first two of them bonafide metal classics but I'm sure the bulk of you who are familiar with Glenn's voice know it thanks to his time fronting the grandfathers of horror Punk the misfits I'm not alone in this but I just want you to know because of my strong feelings on Danzig I refuse to listen to any other era of misfits than the Glenn Danzig era screw the Michael Graves era get it out of my face so I really truly do love I adore I obsess over those early misfits albums they were a huge part of a punk phase that I went through and are just incredibly important to me and what I love about a lot of those records are not just how rough and an aggressive the performances and recordings are of those albums it's not just the horror references but it is Glenn Danzig voice and what I love so much about it is just how much presence depth and melody rings through in his singing not only where his vocals macho and melodic but the tambour of his voice also some of the chords that were underlying a lot of the classic misfit songs were inspired by some classic rock and roll stuff even a bit of rockabilly specifically the music of Elvis Presley so I guess at the time I thought it was cool to pick up on this very clear reverence for someone like the king of rock and roll in this legendary punk band this influence in this connection to this era of music is something the misfits have even tried to maintain post Danzig like on their project 1950 record which is nothing but covers of songs from that era although that's neither here nor there because we're talking about a Danzig record yeah I mean let's let's get into it Danzig coming through with a covers album of yeah Elvis songs while yes it is true that Elvis didn't really write a whole lot of his stuff biggest his best his most popular songs he was an enigmatic performer and popularized a lot of songs popularized a lot of tracks back in his day so on these 14 tracks Glenn is doing what I imagine is is best to tribute that except it it ends up completely disgustingly horrible I don't know how you miss the mark this hard on a covers album you have or I imagine you have the voice you have the passion and the interest in the material that you are covering I imagine you have connections to artists who can pull these songs off instrumentally in some way shape or form how did this album turn out so bad I suppose Glenn does come through with an interesting mix of choices in the tracklist here not only does he pull on a lot of deep cuts here but he makes sure to give the audience a variety of songs from the early years a touch of rockabilly on like baby let's play house then moving later into a bit more of the Las Vegas sort of jumpsuit sunglasses rhinestone era where he is singing over much more lush instrumentals but unless you are already familiar with the source material you would never know because the instrumentals on this thing sucks so hard and they all suck in exactly the same way so did it all just alright let's let's talk about the instrumentals the pianos are so basic and played so ham-fisted Lee they are very awkward they are very ugly to the ear I guess I'll leave it at that but of course more of a backbone than the piano on this record are the guitars they are thin they are very distorted they are blaring and yet they are mixed so quietly it's like they're loud but yet they're so distant and you can barely hear them anyway because the volume is just incredibly low then there is the drums yeah the drumming on this thing went when I guess there there is drumming to make note of is it dammit it's barely even present but when I do actually hear like a full kit it is some some real like like bad local band shit this is this is not like top tier drumming in any way shape or form take note of the track one night for example where the guitars and drums and vocals come together in a way where it just sounds like a really bad barb and it just sounds like a shit ass bar band playing and and singing because the vocals are not great either I don't want to give up too much too soon in this review but but I'll get back to the sound of this thing for just a little bit also there are a lot of weird just like engineering mistakes or oversights on this record as well I mean you are blasted right in the face with one on the opening track is it so strange where there's this very audible like clicking tapping I think it's coming out of the guitar but it's very persistent and it will not stop there's even a point where there's like an audible mist-like strum in the instrumental too and look and listen this is not like a mistake in a cool like rough lo-fi oh we're just going so crazy and animalistic type away and we've lost control and maybe there's a few mistakes like slipping in here and there no these are very like slow boring drably performed songs that are absolutely passionless from a presentation standpoint I mean I would say what is here sounds like just bad karaoke but if someone was actually karaoke at at this level of skill you would be booed off the stage I imagine oh the recording and the instrumental performance is like they really aren't there the musicianship on this thing truly is is bad it's embarrassing it's almost like watching one of those shreds videos on YouTube where you know the the audio is pulled out and then it's filled back with somebody who's like playing instruments bad on purpose I just can't really explain it and and somehow it gets worse and worse and worse for example on the track fever which is a song honestly and I didn't even know Elvis said it had done a cover I'm familiar with and I absolutely loved the Peggy Lee version you give be boo-boo-boo and and Glen's rendition I imagine Elvis's rendition wasn't all that much different but God the drama of this version just is is not there it is not flattering to the original track actually I'm feeling a little bad doing this review because if these versions are your first exposure to any of these songs they they might be ruined for you although I suppose that's not entirely true because there are tracks on this thing that are so bad and so horrendous they sound little to nothing like the original like on the track always on my mind which in my opinion is a BU is a gorgeous Elvis ballad but I'm not even sure if they have the for transitional chords up into the hook on this version right either that or the instrumentation just sounds so demented it's it's like I'm hearing the inbred version of the original and you know let me touch down on the vocals really quickly in this review because given how much I have loved glenn danzig voice over the years even on some of his weaker solo stuff the singing on this record is is bad is is terrible like what why why glenn is repeatedly missing notes blatantly missing notes over and over and over and over on multiple tracks there are songs on here where he like utterly fails to nail the hook again and again and again every time the hook comes up I'm just wondering did they listen back to these like they didn't care that he wasn't like in tune most of the time again this is coming from someone who for a majority of his career has been a very competent singer and this isn't just the case of oh well you know vocally you you can't live up to Elvis you can't sing as good as Elvis no it's it's not really like about having the most technical skill under the Sun or anything like that it's not like this had the most technical skill of any singer alive no Glenn is just singing a lot of these songs blatantly out of dune I will say with girl of my best friend he pulls off his best performance in terms of just sounding like Elvis and his vocals are measured enough to the point where he's not veering too far outside of his range or completely falling out of the tune of the song of the key of the song but that's really the only point on this thing that just does not sound horrible on a vocal front but it really all comes together into an abattoir for Elvis's songs like it's it's like the point of this record was to just slaughter all of them mercilessly yeah it just sounds like I don't know a bunch of drunk uncle's doing Elvis covers that that's pretty much what it sounds like and and uncles who have maybe just picked up their instruments recently like you know that they haven't been playing them for all that long they just decided to start doing this Elvis cover thing for fun and each song here is just like another recording of them totally killing it in the garage or on the back patio I don't get how this album ended up this way like considering everyone who's attached to it how did nobody be like yeah like these all kind of need and another take so they need something they need help help please help like even under the most lo-fi or punk sonic standards this completely completely fails to cut the mustard I don't know if I have anything else to say about this this is just straight bad Glenn could have done a lot better especially just by Elvis you could it man you're disrespecting the King on this I feel like that is what that is what is being done here inadvertently maybe but but still it's actually worth wondering is the material on this somehow less flattering than Doug Walker redoing all of those Pink Floyd songs on the wall I suppose maybe the Doug Walker stuff is worse because he's actively trying to disrespect the wall as a piece of art and musical and cinema franchise but still this this comes at least kind of close yeah this Danzig record it's not good 
nRDrr5rBZl0,hi hi hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you are doing well and it is time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the not-so-best tracks of the week you know what it is they're all linked down below for your own curiosity I do want to give a shout-out to our sponsor in this video the good people over at the ridge they make these nifty nice metal plated minimalist wallets that fit nicely in your front pocket I've been rocking mine for quite a while now or place your disgusting old bulky leather wallet today using that link down below promo code melon 10% off also a down below is our turntable a blink and our patreon page if you want to get some extra bonus monthly content from the channel and support what we do in the process and let's get into the worst tracks of the week we have a few we have a couple we have a handful first Suzuki the new track from little Uzi vert it is terrible repetitive mind the mind-numbing annoying subpart B bad vocal mix and Uzi is doing this awful like baby baby voice thing I don't know what his deal is on this track though in his defense playboy cardi's newest track man did sound like a leftover from uzice recent project eternal a take so maybe hoozy is kind of you know paying it forward with the doing a baby voice track so um I don't know now that you guys have made mediocre versions of each other's music can we just like you know go back to doing what we do best I suppose yeah maybe maybe we also have a new track from Missy Elliott which is one of her most skeletal awkward and annoying singles ever you know maybe with a better groove and some more very lyrics this one could have been a lot better but this this is a little much little much I don't know happy what Missy was thinking on this one I know she makes very colorful in eccentric music and I like that about her but this was not so much yet in my opinion we also have a new track from everything everything progressive pop and rock band and you know can a progressive I guess all rock if you could if you could say such a thing but anyway in bird song is the name of their new single and this sort of sounds like a somewhat bright digital futuristic Radiohead slow burner but truly what is awful and what I cannot stand about this track is the mix in the last third the instrumentation grows more and more dense as the track progresses which in theory is fine but during its loudest moments the synths on this frigging song are searing like they are ear piercing they're deafening like god they crackle like a freaking campfire it is a hideous sound just really disappointed by that one yeah that could have sounded a lot better in in my opinion moving on to the tracks that I thought were meth not blowing me away but still worth pointing out still worth making note of pay attention pay attention we have a new track over here from a metal outfit a bit of a blackened death metal band by the name of old Tsar through the downward dynasties is the name of this track it's got some gnarly ass riffs ok vocals ok vocals but you know the performance is pretty raw and pretty energetic so and it's it's not a bad cut at 5 minutes packs a lot of punch within that span of time give it a try we have also this new track from Kid Cudi and Travis Scott the Scott's reviewed this one over on the Fantana channel full-length style if you want to get more details and thoughts on this song but generally I wasn't too crazy about the lack of structure overall lack of a strong hook and I thought that it mostly just felt like Travis Scott song with a Kid Cudi feature not so much you know like an evenly cut collaboration but between the two I I think there's potential here but I would love to hear more music from them from them in the future where it sounds like you know there's a bit more of a Cuddy slant to what's going on stylistically moving out from there we have a new track from Isaiah Rashad and it's it's okay I mean his flow and his delivery is pretty energetic and then certainly you're grabbing to an extent but structurally the song is a mess and I do not get the appeal of the more low five sections of the track it just kind of pulls a lot of the bass and guts out of the song and the instrumental and it just sounds really thin and unappealing I guess I just don't really get what he's trying to do aesthetically and sonically with this production in the the the the different sounding sections of the track overall it's like different portions of it were mixed in different ways and some sections sound decent other sections sound pretty unflattering I just don't really see the appeal I guess moving on from there we have this track war dance from the band no age it's a somewhat decent lo-fi rocker with some neat guitar passages here and there we have also this new track from Mann Mann which i think is one of their better cuts from this new album cycle certainly a great chorus on this one and surprisingly Rebecca Black is a featured on the song it's it's just kind of you know somewhat quiet background vocal and everything but sort of cool that that connection is is there I guess moving on from there Lamb of God metalcore outfit Lamb of God is back with a brand new single it is new colossal hate it's pretty heavy riffey hard-hitting though Lamb of God I've always felt as a pretty mean potatos metalcore outfit this is not really any different but hey if you love that tried-and-true Lamb of God everything you need nothing you don't type of sound type of approach you will most likely fuck with it it's not bad it just doesn't really stand out to me all that much we have a new track over here from The Killers and this this is one of a handful of songs this week that has a really strong 80s a new wave feel to it I would say there's actually sort of sort of a David Byrne esque tension to the vocals at some points on this one too while I think the vocal performance overall was fine and the tune was decent it just felt a little bit too derivative I feel like the other killers didn't really put their own spin on this one over here fire in bone we have also this track over here from none other than Kelly Lee Owens it is titled Knight it is a pretty mystical piece of techno with a driving beat and I guess some dreamy vocals as well I wish the the the vocals popped out just a little bit more there was a I suppose a more intriguing structure to the whole thing but the grooves toward the very very very end are fantastic I love the way the beat progresses at that point it has some high points some low points it lulls a bit too but I'm still pretty interested to hear what Kelly is going to be bringing on the next full-length LP also over here we have a new track from Yangtze of Seguros Fame coming through with some more solo material it is a slow-burning piece of wondrous and somewhat sad art pop with Ag Cooke production though uh you know fans of the PC music stuff I don't think you're gonna pick up a whole lot of those types of hyper pop details in this track over here maybe outside of the super digital and heavily processed vocals though in my opinion that is one of the least likable characteristics of the track I can't truly say you know what portions of the the the production here can be attributed attributed to AG but I just thought it was a alright aesthetically not one of the bolder works I think Yangtze has been a part of we have also over here a new track from Jessie where this is another cut this week that had a very distinctly 80s sound this one had kind of a synth funk feel the way the track sounded it was almost like something um that I don't know like it like like Prince would have written for another artist or one of his girl groups or something it sort of felt that way stylistically outside of the instrumental sounding pretty derivative and a few of the lyrics here and there being a bit too basic it's it's not a bad cut from Jessie it's it's not too bad especially if you're in a bit of a nostalgic mood we have also over here a new track from Earl Sweatshirt featuring Mack so it is a pretty well structured song for Earl anyway whole world is the title of it I like some of the grim lyricism the beat is not too bad either the song overall reminded me a bit of Billy woods honestly I'm sort of wondering as a result of listening this if Earl fucks with his music at all and if he if he doesn't he absolutely should I'm also listening to this new duck sauce track over here a bit of a house a disco flip it's not bad not one of the best teasers they've dropped as of late but it's got some good grooves on it it's pretty fun we have also this track from Dara Dorian which is a pretty psychedelic funky number that's a little long-winded and Spacey a little hypnotic as well and meditative not a lot about as sonically and vocally that's really sticking out to me but it is titled monk's robes and I will say its sound is very fitting for the title we have also over here a new track from car seat headrest certainly better than the last one there must be more than blood is the title of it but I'm still not really crazy about just how stiff and electronic all the instrumentation is is sounding I I think going in this direction didn't necessarily have to be a bad thing but the the way will is executing in this instance I feel like some of the soul of his lo-fi work is kind of lost in the the more rigid transition he's making to uh I guess this more sequenced instrumentation it's a little unflattering in my view we have also overhearing you track from bright eyes not liking the overly slick production and the super predictable songwriting from Connor on this one but I suppose it's got those fundamental brighteyes elements that sound at least still somewhat special they haven't completely lost their luster over the years and at least since Connor still has it I just feel like it's not really translating in this overly I guess agreeable instrumental palette we have also this new track over here from a little baby and you know as you guys know I didn't really care for his new LP but it seems like we were getting a little bit of extra out of this album cycle all in is the title of the song and what I'm liking about this is that it's it's easily one of the most impassioned verses I think I've ever heard from little baby the way he goes off on this instrumental he's really performing from the heart on this one I'd say it's actually pretty hard hitting emotionally how he goes all-in on this song essentially I will say the instrumental is is pretty average you know it's it sort of baguettes the the whole I guess emotional outburst type of deliveries going for on this song but still it's it's it's still a high point for little baby I would say we have also over here a new track from ab-soul who was also dropping some material this week along with Isaiah Rashad it's the I'm not even gonna try to say it it's a freestyle and you know that there are some questionable one-liners in it you know like like what what is he saying like milk milk the game or milk it for all it's worth like mammary glands okay all right there all right men but still that quirky left-field abyssal energy is there I like the transitions in the instrumental the energy is great it's been too fucking long man it's been too long since we have heard like you know some some decent ABS soul music some some freaking absol musics come on man let's let's get it let's get some at let's get an absol album a tape of something going let's do it let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best ones this week the ones that really stood out to me the ones that really stuck out to me we have first over here band called nothing no where death is the name of the song this is a bit of a weird bit of rap rock I guess it reminds me of rap rock that I used to listen to and I a teenager but there's something like a little darker and edgier about it and I feel like the heavier portions toward the end or are great and on top of it it doesn't really get like Corning like a limp Biskit song or anything like that that's you know it's obviously like some aggressive white rap it's it's got very much kind of the that tone to it which again sort of throws it back a little bit for me but I don't know this to me feels like a little are a little more artistically valid yeah a little bit less cringy than some of the stuff I used to listen to when I was a kid some of y'all might not fuck with it that's fine but you know 16 year old me is living for it we have also over here this new track from a posthumous track posthumous single from juice world I did a full-length review of this one over on the Fantana channel as well have quite a few thoughts on it there but I will say over here with the guitar sample the straightforward track be the vocal melodies too it's it's pretty much the juice world formula however it is done incredibly well and I think is a great tribute to you know juice world's musical legacy so I guess I'm just hoping that the rest of the tracks on this most likely forthcoming record do the same you know I would hate to hear anything coming out of the vault that is unflattering or just not juice world's best so uh there you go we have also over here bodyguard the new track the new single from JPEG mafia it's a good one it's one where he is a sort of sort of bringing in the pop and the R&B influences quite a bit it's passionate it's lovely it's got a somewhat glitchy lumbering instrumental that backs up his voice pretty well and just Peggy is continuing to kill it going in this somewhat sensitive direction so let's do it we also have this new track from James Blake you're too precious love this one seems like a mix of the piano song hurry and the quirky strange electronic sound play in beats that we have come to expect from James coming together in a very even way I like these very strange progression of the song too and hopefully he stays creative on this new album cycle because this one was a pretty pretty enchanting we also have Nick Hakeem over here songwriter music producer who was coming through with this uh yeah pretty chill piece of loaf I songwriting someone someone loaf I it's mixed fidelity it's mixed fidelity I'll say and it's just a really chill straightforward tune with some great vocals you know it's it's just got a lot of good basics to it I guess is what I'll say and I just like how rough around the edges it is - I loved the the oddly soulful track that I reviewed or talked about in this video series from Nick a few weeks ago and diggin on this new track as well so I'm just keeping my ear to the ground on Nick's work because I'm just liking what I am hearing Nick's been around quite a while and it's a sort of strange and disappointing at least to me that I'm just stumbling upon his stuff recently we also have this new track from Deerhoof over here farewell symphony it is an idiosyncratic piece of noise rock and only the way that dear Huff can do it it's abrasive it's in your face it's got that quirky weird energy to it as well some decent grooves and some some just burning weird melodies on it as well diggin it I'm liking it we have also over here Christine and the Queens who has seen fit to drop a cover of Travis Scott's highest in the room and dare I say it's better than the original Wouter so great job on that we have also over here Charli XCX Claus amazing new single production from Dylan Brady of 100 x fame it kicks ass great hook great beat great everything I love it love it love it and has me super psyched for this new album cycle and also the 1975 have come through with a new track if you're shy let me know also a bit of an 80s throwback on this one strong New Wave vibes coming off of this track especially with that sex solo at the very end that's it's pretty much an 80s anthem to a tee but still I think they do the style and they do the song that they've written in that style a lot of justice Armin's good production dig it quite a bit and I think that is going to be the weekly track roundup for this week thank you everyone for watching and listening hopefully you've got some good recommendations out of this video and I will catch you in the next one Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup 
IothoUVKPas,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd hope you're feeling well it's time for an EP review of this new Cal you cheese project to feel alive this is a new tiny batch of tracks from singer Kelly u cheese it's been just a few years now since the release of her big breakout debut record isolation back in 2018 where stylistically and vocally she really came into her own finding power in a dreamy series of tracks that underwent these chameleon-like changes from Latin pop to dancehall to neo soul and R&B so far Kelly's music has proven to be so versatile she really could go anywhere at this point so of course a new batch of tracks is going to be exciting because where will they take us next but despite the excitement I had when I saw this EP was dropped out of the blue that I left this thing severely underwhelmed it's pretty much to the point where I'm not really seeing the point of this project as fans are just sitting here hunkered down waiting for something bigger to come down the pipe whether that be an album or a mixtape as the tracks on this EP feel like they are just barely scratching the surface of what could be a larger better produced concept thematically all the songs on this thing circle around love and romantic conflict like many of the songs off of isolation in her early releases but I guess there's kind of a story coming together on the four tracks here as we progress from the love sick bliss of honey baby spoiled where there seems to be a touch of doubt in this very early stage of the relationship still though Kelly seems to be enjoying the sex the affection the nice things that come along with this relationship then when we finish things up on the closing track we have Callie delivering these breathy vocal harmonies over plucked strings saying stuff like love the smell of you burning your last bridge with me Oh things in this relationship turn really really bad really really fast over this very short series of songs given this I can only imagine how many details how many pieces of the plot we are missing out on by rushing to the end of this thing so quickly also I can only imagine how much of a powerhouse this closing track would have been over a more ambitious instrumental as this cut and pretty much every other cut here production-wise is relatively stripped back even many of the courses don't really pop which again is pretty much why I'm coming out of this EP feeling like I'm just experiencing lost potential as there are so many details that were not really privy to and structurally instrumentally nearly everything on this EP sounds half-baked just compare it to her early stuff just compare it to nearly anything off of isolation don't get me wrong for the most part Kali brings the usual sensual sweet soft subtle vibe that trademark sound that aesthetic that you expect on top of it there are moments of flashes genius lyrical bits like I want war but I need peace this track is easily my favorite track on the EP and yet it's far from one of my favorite cally songs in general there's nothing on this EP that I found to be outright terrible outside of a few questionable lyrics and the vocal performance on the opener not being Callie's best necessarily I do appreciate the little bit of progression I guess we get narrative ly across these tracks again from that intro to the point on I want war where Kali is really just making it known her needs are not being fulfilled her patience tested but still the highlights on this thing are so few and far between I'm just hoping what's here is like leftovers or something or just a very light stripped-down version of something bigger and grander and more ambitious that we may hear down the line at some point because while yes this EP does tick a lot of those usual callaloo cheese boxes and that's great and that's fine it doesn't go nearly as far creatively melodically structurally instrumentally as anything she has done prior so feeling a light five on this one transition have you given this EP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what's your dire review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the Bell is well over here next to my head is another video to check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Kelly you cheese forever

fsTud32GJrg,hi everyone Hanover here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new West Side gun album pray for Paris this is a new full-length LP from prolific Buffalo rapper Griselda Records artist Westside gun this makes the first addition to his ever-growing discography in 2020 it comes hot off the heels of his popular Hitler where's editor may 7 mixtape that dropped last year along with that really good Griselda group tape but now it's a different year it is a different album but for some reason I am going into this project here expecting roughly the same thing meaning very simple and sample heavy instrumentals some of which may have a boom-bap flavor mid-paced flows that come along with a uniquely nasally delivery that is a little Ghost Face ish a lot of coke talk a lot of gun talk as well as quite a few wrestling references great features from fellow Griselda boys Benny and Conway thematically a strong contrast between street smart thuggish Ness and upper crust decadence and the ad lids finally on pray for Paris I guess I expect there to be a strong vibe a strong aesthetic but not necessarily super robust or dynamic or multi-phased songwriting and look this isn't to say that West Side gun is incapable of doing anything else but this is the horse he rode in on essentially and so far this is just what Griselda's hardcore fanbase loves so I get why Westside would want to stick to his gun and also meet the expectations of his fans who have supported him through his come up because love him or hate him you can't really accuse West Side gun of changing up his sound or style to pander to bigger artists or a larger audience whether that be a Eminem or jay-z through rock nation the artists who choose to work with Griselda are always having to meet them where they are at and that's a really admirable thing to have that kind of leverage and have that sort of power and resolve to just hunker down and decide that you are going to do your thing on your own terms so no matter what I say in this review let it be known that I know that there is really no reason logically that Westside Gunn should give a shit about anything that I say because he's kind of doing what works for him but still having said that if you've listened to anything Westside has done as of late or Griselda for that matter you pretty much know what you're getting into with pray for Paris from the intro which is just entirely an audio snippet at a Christie's art auction where a piece sells for millions and millions of dollars to all the butter ad-libs on the closer which are also met with lines like on the cover of Vogue just me and my stove I feel like all I can really report is that Westside skills have been honed a little bit on this project and that there are a lot of quality features that help build these songs out and prevent them from feeling so bear or one-dimensional the track jorge bondo has a killer combination of Westside and Benny and Conway it's the Grizelda boys it's as good as any track off of WW CD it has this amazing boom-bap be instrumental with all of these weird plinky dizzying piano runs they also go for a twofer on this record with the same great energy on the track Allah sent me the only thing really missing on this track was a better instrumental I think this beat is just kind of okay but still the chemistry between these three guys easily makes up for that there's also this amazing million dollar man audio snippet at the end of this track that honestly does does kind of get to me because it brings back like a lot of young kid WWF memories it really does we have the track three to seven which features not just Joey badass but Tyler the Creator which seems like an odd placement for a Griselda track but it actually kind of works even if Tyler's verse is a little uncharacteristically braggadocious plus the tracks serene jazzy instrumental mental super-smooth hook our likable to certainly it's a lot more detail and structured than what you typically hear in a West Side track it's just a good vibe good instrumental good versus quality hook to no more no less given West Side guns style and the things that he raps about it only makes sense that you would have a track with Freddie Gibbs and rock Marciano with a $500 ounces the Westside does end up landing on the back end of this track feeling a bit like an afterthought especially since his verse is the least robust of the three which again does serve as a reminder that sometimes Westside can emphasize a bit too much his style or how he says something over the substance of what he's actually saying still I do have to point out there is something truly dramatic and poetic with how he goes about the track Versace and it's not just the gorgeous vintage vocal sample on the instrumental it's also when he is reflecting on his time in jail and missing his family toward the end of the track that really hits hard however I'm not sure how much the gun sounds actually add to such a somber moment on the project we have a DJ premiere be on the track Shawn versus flair which is actually so good it kind of makes the song I do wish it was longer though maybe there could have been a feature there but still there are some more major missteps on the record that are worth pointing out like the way Westside pitches his voice down on the track Claybourne kick it just ends up sounding really goofy and awkward and I don't see really what it brings to the track at all then there's also the very awkward Keyshia plum feature on party with pop smoke which sounds like it was recorded on the cheap and not eacute or mixed very well into the track on top of that it mostly seems like a poetic fetishization of the type of lifestyle that west side is always rapping about like if if no-name had had dropped this but but it wasn't so so good if he got a felony it's guaranteed to excite me gun and drug charges give me butterflies evil is Satan but I see God all his eyes this seems like it's trying a bit too hard but okay we then have the unlistenable french toast which instrumentally the piano runs and the drums on this thing make it sound like a leftover Tyler the Creator beat from flower boy or something on top of that what really ruins the song is Westside singing it is terrible it is awful even with the knowing clip at the end of the track that acknowledges he's not really much of a singer it really does kind of kneecap the track really kills any hope of me enjoying it you know wale on the song doesn't even really get it get a chance to save it the the the singing is so excruciating overall I guess I thought this album was okay I liked it more than fly god I liked it more than the recent Hitler where's Adam a mixtape but I still feel like Westside is at a point where he is punching very deeply under his weight like the music he's making could be so much more impactful and yet at this point it's not however to what I said earlier he's in a position right now where he doesn't really need to do anything other than what he wants to do so I mean if this works for him if this fills his bank account and it makes him happy and this is what artistically he feels like he gets something out of doing by all means do it because it seems to be working guys like Tyler the Creator don't just saunter on to your record when you have nothing good going for you so feeling a light to decent six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should our view next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit

XGTBxV-RLwI,ah hi everyone yeah that any head here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Fiona Apple album fetch the bolt cutters this is a new full-length LP from legendary singer-songwriter Fiona Apple one of the most enigmatic musicians of the 90s and her once in a blue moon album release schedule has now led us to her fifth full-length LP which is an interesting release for Fiona instead of getting more conventional with age she is kicking off her 40s sinking even deeper into the tense idiosyncrasies that have informed all of her records thus far in a lot of ways fetch the bolt-cutters isn't just the Fiona Apple that we've known but the Fiona Apple we've known was always there behind the sweeter and more accessible aspects of her early records because she is sounding more in her feelings than ever the resentment the bitterness the love sickness on these high-strung tracks it's all turned up to 11 and the emotional strain of it all is enhanced by the very raw rickety instrumentation which is certainly noisier and more unorthodox than anything that was on idler-wheel in 2012 by comparison on bolt cutters the vocals are wild the pianos are a little blemished here and there the drums don't even sound like drums half the time they're more like anything that could have been banged on next to a microphone which makes bolt cutters like any number of Tom Waits albums in that sense an artist whose catalogue I'm sure Fiona's is is well aware of beyond that I want to say I think there are a lot of admirable qualities to this record but it is not without its flaws in fact I can't help but feel like this home studio setting that fiona has embarked on this album with has led to tracks that are a little half-baked especially when she seems to be working under the impression that the junk pile percussion and lack of a lyrical filter are replacements for just a good song like on the title track where the noisy odd bits of rhythm along with the dissonant chord progression and talked some vocals make for a very curious intro the instrumentation blossoms beautifully for the first minute or so with a lot of jazzy resolutions but once the hook hits it's like the track hits a brick wall from there it turns very stale very fast and not for a lack of good ideas but a lack of variation an overabundance of indulgence as well as tension but with no release with the track relay it's a somewhat similar situation the kickoff is great bold ear grabbing but what sounds like a cool intro just ends up being the song itself four minutes of chance and naked vocal harmonies and booming drums and as much as I like the sentiment of the song the whole thing is just a bit too grating and messy with the song for her I like the tragic bitter lyrics all over this track but the incessant zany vocal harmonies along with the breakneck transitions just sound like a lot of time and effort being sunk into a gimmick for sure the ideas on this track would have made for a cool year grabbing moment in a more coherent song but what we're not getting here is a coherent song especially when we go into this droning vocal transition past the midpoint that just seems like an excuse to bow out without the audience thinking you're just cutting things short look I get how the more abrasive sounds on this record along with the the dogs barking makes for a really cool interesting blurb but if we're being honest with ourselves here it's not like these elements add up into the most crazy experimental singer-songwriter record of all time the songs off this LP that ended up sticking with me the most were the ones where these more unconventional bits of instrumentation and percussion were used to back up a more focused song the opening track I want you to love me even with the slightly weirder instrumental approach is classic Fiona Apple through and through the elegant but grim piano also Fiona's vocals on this track growing more unsettling and wired and the lyrics on the track just demand love in such an unapologetic way and while I'm in this body I want somebody to want and I want what I want and I want she is like a wanting machine and animal acting purely on primal desires as lyrically she also goes about rationalizing these feelings in this behavior with all of this flowery language lyrically I think it's a very smart contrast I also love the way the cycling piano passage at the end of this track transitions right into Shamika as the intro of that track is like a faster version of that piano phrase and this track essentially presents us with a story going back to Fiona's childhood where she was dealing with some bullies then another tougher kid I guess gave her some words of encouragement saying she saw potential in her and the way this track plays out it feels like one of those weird spotty childhood memories that you don't remember the full context of it but for whatever reason maybe because you had some intense feelings around at the time you just recall elements of it very strongly fiona says on the song that Shamika was not gentle to her she was not her friend but she got through to her and I guess at the time she must have needed that and it meant so much that I guess she had to stick with her long enough for her to record the song for this record we also have the very haunting newspaper which is so dark in tone it reminds me almost of like a Nick Cave song but narrative Lee the track seems to be inspired by some kind of broken or missed connection with two other people as she describes this male figure kissing her and kissing this other person and then Fiona wanting to get in the middle of that but then this guy is like basically poisoning this other person against her by saying things behind her back and basically trying to force her out of the picture and when reading into the lyrics this guy seems to have some abusive tendencies too so in a lot of respects it is a very harrowing track especially with Fiona's vocals on the hook which are easily some of the most expressive and dark on the entire LP the song ladies emotionally and instrumentally is a pretty big change of pace with its swaying groove and kind of charming vocals there are some similar themes on this track as well about not allowing men to dampen the fire or desires or agency of a woman narrative Lee it's not as specific or as to the point as newspaper it's a lot more big picture and abstract cosmonauts I thought was a great highlight on the LP - despite the instrumental being as cluttered as it is but this was in my opinion the last robust song on the entire LP as everything past this point feels a little under written a little too much like a motif or just one of the more left-field spots on the record I didn't get quite as much out of but look despite my complaints of which I do have many with this record I still did end up liking it and I still do admire a lot of qualities about it and for sure it's going to stick out as one of the most unique releases in fiona's catalog because of the the instrumental approach the rhythm just how raw the entire presentation is as well as how great some of the songs on here are and look even some of my least favorite tracks on this thing do still come forward with good ideas I just wish those ideas were packed into more coherent songs or were pushed even further into the deep to the point where they were truly daring and experimental as good as many parts of this album are my biggest fears we may only ever hear them in this state I don't know how many more records Fiona may make along these lines and it would have been amazing to hear the ideas on this project presented in a more robust fashion where they all felt a bit more groomed and a bit more thoroughly explored still I'm feeling a strong 6 - a light 7 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video

SyWmV_oD2us,hi everyone St Athan e fu tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new rena saw a yama album saw a yama this is a new full-length LP from UK via japan pop singer-songwriter Rina saw a yama it is a debut album that I have been highly anticipating ever since the drop of her 2017 EP that rocked my world that record was an awesome revitalization of Ott's era dance and diva pop and I just have been waiting here very patiently for more the closer we have gotten to the release of this album the more excited I have been because arena has been teasing toward this record with some great singles on top of it we have pop Alchemist Clarence clarity handling the bulk of the production on this thing it really is a brave new world for pop music right now and Rina is contributing to that and she is defining exactly how on this new batch of tracks and just like on her EP in 2017 it is with a mix of something old something new but now with more stylistic variation instrumental ambition and with there being more tracks on this thing generally Rina really gets an opportunity to explore her heritage her identity along with her personal philosophy and feelings on the world at large on numerous tracks here and she's doing all of it over this grand and subtly weird production that only Clarence clarity could bring to the table the expanded tracklist on this project also allows Rina to explore the various shades of pop and even rock that inspire her music and the results of that are equal parts catchy and exciting especially on the next level intro dynasty what ok we're gonna start things this epic with the bells and the booming drums and the heavy ass guitars to be honest the instrumental is compressed just a little bit too much the finer details of everything do kind of get lost in the thickness of it all but hey message received either way I love reena's lyrics on this track about coming to terms with your past your heritage how that can influence your life path forward and also struggling with breaking away from that the grooves are hard as hell the way the orchestral and more rock instrumentation meld is is pretty even Rena's vocal on the track the harmonies are so slick and gratifying to she is most definitely grown as a singer over the past few years thankfully on the next song and the vast majority of the pop-oriented cuts here the mix isn't so suffocating the track excess is all about living a life of excess of greed also feeling like I I guess you deserve it reena's vocals as well as the instrumental like some songs off of her EP a while ago reminds me of like some 2000s era Christina Aguilera but now the instrumental with Clarence clarity being at the helm feels way more left-field a lot of strange edits peppered throughout it all so these grinding descending metal riffs jumping and occasionally to transition the song from one section to the next Darrin Aaron an earner which juxtapose very nicely against the tracks acoustic guitar licks and very sweet vocal harmonies and glassy since the metal guitars though make a return with a vengeance on the track STFU which has all these groovy jump the fuck up riffs rattling high hats buried away in the background also Rena throwing in these sinister laughs one of which at one point is is done in melody also the way she's singing on this track it's the kind of vocal that reminds me a little bit of some Evanescence but I mean that in the best way possible it does read a little Evanescence also the poppy acoustic transitions into a very light chorus where Rina can be heard saying very gently shut the fuck up I love it this sound and this style as being recontextualized so creatively on pop records of course we've had a few examples of this over the past few years especially with Poppy's new I disagree album but still I think STFU over here stands is one of the more creative and interesting instances of this also the lyrics of the track are pretty cool with Rina singing about being angry and validating that essentially whether that be directed at a person or something that's just getting on your nerves we then transition into something a lot easier on the ears with comme des Garcons like the boys which is a very chill piece of electro pop with a prominent synth bassline normally this is the type of thing I would hear embraced by an artist or a group if they wanted to make a really bland like runway jam or something that was fitting for the dressing room but the way this track turns out it's actually a few cuts above anything of that nature there are also a lot of fun and interesting details packed into the instrumental to Riina's lyrics go the extra mile as well as she explores themes of egoism and confidence and how those cut along gender lines meanwhile the track Akasaka said instrumentally and vocally sounds pure Clarence clarity like it could have been a track from one of his past couple of records from the kooky sound effects and edits throughout the instrumental to the demented and strange ways with which he alters arenas voice on the song I do think rena puts her own spin on this track vocally though she sings quite well throughout it and lyrically we have some themes that are similar to that of dynasty where rena almost seems like she's falling into a negative emotional pattern that was on set by her parents or something that her parents had gone through being from japan originally rena seems to spend most of the track just lamenting about jetlag and traveling and feeling displaced or out of place or like she lacks a sense of being here even if instrumentally it does stick out like a sore thumb in this tracklist and it is quite a bit sadder than many of the other songs here it's still a major highlight for me the emotions on this record change up big-time though on the following track paradise in' which runs like a very cool combination of pop punk and j-rock with a super-huge soaring melodic chorus many of the songs lyrics dealing in Rina Living somewhat recklessly as a young girl having these weird experiences like being hacked at one point in her life it's just kind of a cool blissful euphoric trip down memory lane in a more carefree moment of her life we then get another highlight on the track love me for me whose message of self-esteem and self-acceptance comes through pretty clear being worthy of love and acceptance without having to present yourself in an over-the-top or a deceiving way but really the selling point of the song for me is it's really sharp combination of synth pop and new jack swing on the instrumental with a really modern punch the hits keep coming in this damn tracklist bad friend is a first moody and then righteous anthem a great pop tune reflecting on old friendships and essentially losing connections with those who at one time in your life might have meant a whole lot to you and feeling responsible for not maintaining those connections as life's changes I guess altered your path and maybe made them less of a priority the fuck this world interlude feels a bit much to just be an interlude I think it drags on a little too long I wish it had a bit more punch to it as much as I do agree with the sentiment who's gonna save you now instrumentally is a pretty big change up as we enter into this pallet of arena rock that is fused with all of this fake crowd noise of people clapping and cheering also the way the instrumental is mixed the boomy guitars and drums and the reverb on the vocals it all sounds like it's meant to come off as if it were alive but it's really not personally I think it would have sounded better if it had been put together like many of the other tracks here but these issues aren't so terrible they ruin the song and the song at the core of this track is still good along with rayna's vocal performance we then get a love letter to Riina's country-of-origin on the track tokyo love hotel where she seems to propose that she knows and loves and cares about Tokyo and Japan in a way that is deeper and and I guess more conscious than that of someone who is stereotyping or kind of just fetishizing Japanese culture really what ends up me capping this track a little bit though is how compressed the instrumental is I don't know why the song is so damn thick even though it's just a synth pop instrumental a la like emotion era Carly Rae Jepsen thankfully this tiny low in the tracklist gets picked up immediately by the fantastic chosen family a gorgeous emotional and impactful ballad where Rina is exploring one again these themes of friendship saying essentially it doesn't matter who you are where you're from what you did as long as we're connected then we can be family we can be close we don't need to be related to relate we don't need to share genes or a surname the building instrumentation on the track and also the way Rena kills it vocally on the back and wow the notes she hits the volume the presence the power all of that adds up and makes this one of the most just hit me punch me in the heart songs here we also have a pretty hard-hitting closer in the tracks snakeskin where Rena dramatically explores these themes of change also being used marketing her pain in a way as a commercial artist I suppose and this is all happening over a jittery multi-phased and very busy instrumental with a few weird breakdowns narrative Lee it's interesting but I'm not entirely sure what makes it a tie-up still you can't really argue that the record isn't going out with a bang on this one overall though this is a very good start to what I hope is a very robust catalog of albums from Reena saw Amma yeah there are a few tracks that are more underwhelming than others a few missteps a few points where the the production could use some work maybe a bit more stylistic anthem attic focus as well but still at this point in her career all of those things are much further along than you would expect them to be and there are still a ton of killer songs in this tracklist and good stunning impressive vocal performances - so while there are certainly room to improve here in a lot of ways Reena is coming to us fully formed feeling a light - decent 8 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my

AOr3oZEmLFk,hey hey hi hey hi hello hey hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd I hope you are doing well and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the worst and the best tracks of the week you know what it is all the songs and everything are linked down below so you can check them out for yourself like usual along with our turntable a blank which we do get kicked back from so buy yourself some vinyl over there of some records we reviewed on the channel also a patreon our patreon page is linked down below get some extra cool sexy bonus monthly content for a very cheap tear also access to our discord as well so I check it out check it out and also shout out to the blame our Crevier loop daddy who has a new song out essential workers anthem a tribute to all the essential workers out there who keep the world turnin while the world is literally burnin not not literally literally but you you know what I mean so shout out to them shout out to mark that is linked down below and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the worst this week we have a couple one French Montana that's a fact this song is boring that's a fact productions really hollow soaked and reverb French doesn't really do much lyrically or vocally to pick things up or make the track interesting it's just boring and I don't really get the is is this art like a referencing Family Guy is this trying to look like Family Guy I don't really get it moving on from their new track from car seat headrest Hollywood total mess of a song cringy actually sounds like a very awful garage punk revival single from the 2000s and the lyrics I just do not get like what exactly about this point in time culturally necessitates uh I hate Hollywood type of song I mean Hollywood is not the be-all end-all and is certainly a worthy of quite a bit of criticism but it's like hot Hollywood Hollywood is the object of your anger right now and in this moment in time and okay and and even if it's a bit ironic or post-ironic I don't know it's still even in that context doesn't really seem to make all that much sense I don't get it I I guess I just don't get it moving on from there we have a new track from 21 savage as well featuring a summer Walker summer walkers actually the highlight of the song her vocals sound pretty great the few points where they are placed meanwhile the beat is boring and 21 Savage is sounding way way way way way too in his feelings all over this cut not not that you can't be emotional but he just comes off like super desperate and you know you don't want to sound desperate on a song you really don't let's move on to the track so I thought were me they weren't terrible but they weren't blowing me away either you might like them more than me here we go we have a new track from none other than Tom mich as well as Yusuf days featuring Freddie frickin gives Gary and Gary Indiana rapper Freddie Gibbs and the title of this track is Knight Rider and it's a very chill smooth somewhat soulful smoked anthem Freddie Gibbs singing on the cut a little more than you're used to hearing him sing and it's okay it's got a chill vibe to it it's got a chill vibe we also have new track from the streets call my phone thinking I'm doing nothing better I do like some elements of Mike's lyrics on this track and I think the concept is cool and it's nice that there is a bit of a tame impala crossover with this track too but the beat is grating and one-dimensional as hell and is doing the song absolutely no favors whatsoever we need an instrumental redo thank you Sam Smith and Demi Lovato come together form like Voltron on this new track this new single over here I'm ready which sounds like a combination of like a modern pop song but a little dark little moody with a some trap backing and then a few transitions into passages that sound like something out of a Disney musical you know like like when the princess is sort of finding the love of her life and is kind of proclaiming that in song in the midst of the storyline or something it's it's a very weird huge infusion of sounds and ideas and it's it's sort of works a little bit I guess I'll say say that I like Sam Smith's vocals on the track they're pretty good we also have a new track from Russian and well aan juice world who actually does really well on this song rest in peace juice because if it weren't for him on this track I don't really think I would like this as much as I do which is a little bit it's not a perfect track and I do think and well and Russian aren't the best vocalists in the world but a juice really does add that much to the song where it does make it worth listening to moving on from there man the new single from play Blake Rd meth it is man it's literally just made for this segment I guess it's made for this section you can check out my full review of this track over on the Fantana channel but yeah it's it's a pretty boring song playboy cardi's voice is just okay the beat actually kind of stinks it sounds like an eternal a take leftover and I don't know there's not really much of a groove vibe or flow to what's going on here to really enchant the listener I think it just sounds a little silly I guess moving on from there we have a new track from Paul Banks's own mus thankfully this is like the least dreadful song of the bunch that has been a teasing toward this new project so far though I still would not say it's like you know one of the greatest dreary rock songs I've ever heard in my life moving on from there we have a new track from a new single from a none other than Kalani everybody business and I think Kalani has some pretty expressive moments on this track but I just do not get how sterile and oversimplified the instrumental is I feel like there really could have been a lot more done on the production side to enhance the drama of this track and Kalani just kind of ends up sounding a little unsupported by the whole thing frankly we also have a new track from Jody gimme love new single reviewed this one over on the Fantana channel as well didn't think it was all that bad awesome back end with some fantastic arranged instrumentation as questionable as I think the hook is give it a try give it a shot it's got some atomism some admirable qualities to it and ooh there we go Jeff Beck Johnny Depp isolation John Lennon cover it's not bad but I just do not get what it is about this quarantine situation that that makes celebrities want to do covers but but again in in Johnny Depp's defense this one is not all that bad so move there we have this track over here from healing potpourri and the name of the song is think about us and it's a really nice piece of a chamber pop it's really a nice piece of chamber pop the vocals aren't super distinct but the song is good the song is good and the instrumentation is very pretty so give it a try give it a give it a try give it a shot we also have a new track over here from Florence and the Machine it is a little bit of a slog I will say that but there are some vocal lines and instrumental passages on this very slow burner that are quite pretty light of love give it a try and also division is out with their new record flawless do it well featuring summer Walker is the name of this track over here once more summer Walker kind of ends up being the highlight but generally I think divisions approach to R&B is very so so bland trendy and average that is pretty much the case for this cut over here - moving on from their cheap cuts featuring Pete Wentz check your phone I am a little torn on this track and maybe with more lessons that can grow on me because there are elements of it that are annoying but purposefully annoying as the whole concept of the song is to constantly being reminding the listening person listening that either they should be checking their phone or they're living in a state of society and culture where they're always found to be checking their phone and it does really kind of make you conscious of the dependency in a way so no give it a try it's kind of fun but still annoying intentionally like I said it's it's it's an interesting concept without sounding too much like a Luddite or anything like that we also have this track from Bon Iver please don't live in fear it's uh I guess kind of a pretty track I mean it's it's structurally it's a little amorphous in my opinion I think it could have had a stronger backbone to it rhythmically especially but uh I guess there are some cool vocal harmonies and passages from Justin on here you know if you're a bony vert addict give it a shot all right we also have Bob Dylan I contain multitudes Bob Dylan essentially uh tributing his own I guess personal dynamism dynamics just talking about how multifaceted of a person he is with some of his better lyrics in a while I think the instrumentation is pretty underwhelming but I think Bob Dylan is writing from an interesting place on this one I will give him that and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best ones this week hell yeah starting off with a quarantine boogie Walter Martin of The Walkmen Fame coming through with this song that is essentially about just being in quarantine and it's it's actually quite funny it's very funny it's a very clever song it's amazing that he took the time to put this together because it is very entertaining and I guess reflective of the time that we live in yeah I guess I'll say that and also shout out to Matt Barron was a guest on the song moving out from there we have another track from Umbra but hey the new metalcore supergroup fronted by Jacob Bannon of converge Fame and it is heavy it is twisted it is pummeling I'm looking forward to hearing more from this group just to tell you the title of the song is mantra of madness we also have Reena saw AMA the song over here I would like to point in your direction is bad friend I'm not going to say anything about this song further other than that it is in the best section because it is a great song I will be talking about this song and all the other songs on this album soon as I plan to review the new album from Reena soon this week so keep an eye out okay keep keep an eye out for the review all right moving on from there another track from this band masterpiece machine letting you in on a secret I'm liking the group's kind of weird heavy approach aggressive approach to psych music it's it's very evocative and weird I suppose it is kind of fitting for the cover it doesn't make me feel like I'm in a neon colored desert of some sort give it a try give it a shot moving on from there Kid Cudi the cut min the cud stir scott has come through with a new track but he did other delinquents is the name of this one going in a bit of a boom bap direction a huge rock hem influence I think on the flow and it's just all around a good quality hip hop song with some good bars good flows mix of new and old it's quite nice one of K what I'm one of Cuddy's better singles in a while so hell yes moving on from there Jamie xx has come through with a very groovy and somewhat left-field jam I don't know if you previously have enjoyed Jamie's production on his solo work give this one a try - you will not be disappointed I think the rhythms and the use of samples are actually quite creative this one so give it a listen Fiona Apple Shamika also not going to say too much about this one it's in the best section because it's a good song give it a listen the album just dropped I'm gonna review it in this week and I don't want to spoil anything or give up too many thoughts too soon as my opinion on the record my feelings are still in development and I'm still processing it I haven't decided what my reviews gonna be yet [Music] moving on from their backwash shout out to rapper backwash who has a new project on the way this new song of theirs over here let me get this up here in front of my face is black magic featuring eight a rook and it's it's very witchy dark tortured piece of trap music and I mean I'm not trapped in literal like drug-dealing sense but you know it's kind of got that beat it's got that vibe but it's darker it's harsher as I said earlier it's which year it's it's which year it's it's literally titled black magic so right now we have aggressive experimental hip-hop going in a black magic occult type of direction hey let's see where it goes so far with this track sound and pretty good alright let's let's keep it moving we also have a new track actually a couple of tracks but one specifically that I wanted to point now from the new upcoming amnesia scanner record is going featuring Lizza hope I'm pronouncing that name correctly is the name of this track and it's it's kind of a weird combination of I guess art pop and some deconstructed Club and it's it's somewhat industrial to some of the tones of the electronics and yeah it's it's a little left-field so out there it's a little harsh but kind of groovy and hooky as well so I'll give it a try give it a shot the cover is certainly disturbing enough to warrant some kind of intrigue don't you think and I will leave it at that that has been the weekly track roundup everyone thank you very much for listening you are the best and I will see you in the next video hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this one and yeah I will see you in all of this week's reviews anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever 
I-L_MDmJxU0,
ddy8WPKFDb4,hey everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you are doing well and it is time for a review of the new Laura Marling album song for our daughter this is the latest full-length LP from UK singer-songwriter Laura Marling it is her seventh album over the years it's been interesting to see Laura progress and evolve artistically and thrive through one of the most tumultuous and saturated eras of popular music the 2010s her discography throughout this decade was marked with a supreme amount of maturity and grace and somehow that's even more so the case for her newest work here simultaneously this is her most direct and no frills album in years two certainly more so than the bold short movie as well as the nine tracks semper Femina the instrumentals on this LP while lightly arranged in a very beautiful way are some of Laura's most rustic in a while as well everything you need nothing you don't even as she flirts with a bit of gentle and patient folk rock on the opening track Alexandra and closes up shop with some gently strum guitars and harmonized hums on for you and I had a feeling things might move in this direction off of hearing a teaser from this record held down which is a pretty blunt cut with a super strong vocal line on the hook layered with some boldly strum guitars and cascading vocal harmonies to even more detail is added when these soaring wailing guitar harmonies enter the fold and create a really euphoric sensation but really the selling point of the track ends up being Laura's stunning and very earnest vocals and lyrics then I suppose there's the matter of the album title song for our daughter and while this album is not a concept it is packed with a lot of personal contemplative and familial themes enough to thread through most of the tracks here making this album a pretty cohesive listen there are some interesting character portraits and the mix on this thing too so far in this review maybe I'm talking a bit too much about the big picture appeals of this album but song for our daughter is just one of those records that everything that is great about it is just so immediately thrown into your face despite the fact that the listening experience here is relatively chill Jen easygoing sweet on the ears I should also mention the instrumentals are pretty versatile as well I see Laura channeling a bit of Paul Simon on the very funky focuses of strange girl not only that but some of Laura's most frank and hilarious lyrics on the album and appear to as she is describing in great detail this person who is hot-blooded and hard-headed build yourself a garden and have something to attend cut off all relations because you could not stand your friends announce yourself a socialist to have something to defend a young girl please don't me there's a sharp energy to the track I can't deny the following only the strong is much more low-key and simplistic instrumentally but just as bold Laura's voice and singing even in a measured tone has an authoritative depth to it that is just commanding through this track we have enchanting fingerpick guitars as well as these gorgeous vocal harmonies one lyrical gem after another about surviving love describing it as a sickness healed by time we then have the very dramatic blow-by-blow which seems like a combination of a somewhat dreary Joni Mitchell style piano ballad combined with the arranged theatrics of like Kate Bush's fifty words for snow the one major downside to this track is that it boughs out a little prematurely underneath a wash of orchestral strings we then have the title track which I see as a pretty incredible musical communique that features Laura singing along with some light touches of piano and guitar lyrically she is essentially trying to give her daughter a heads up here on sexism objectification going down the wrong path feeling unsure of yourself feeling lost being influenced by those who may want to take advantage of you in some way it's a supremely heartening moment on the record and shows that a few things are paralleled by a mother's love we then get more chamber folk on the track fortune which is a meditation on just hoping things get better Laura's lyrics on this track hit upon some pretty heartbreaking imagery feeling like you're going through this intense amount of suffering and pain that you just want to let up a mother who's also just collecting gathering money in order to use that to run away while there are some specifics of the track that are a bit dodgy what I can gather from the narrative so far along with the tune just makes me want to cry like a frickin baby and you guys know I do that also making me want to cry is the song the end of the affair which narrative Lee is exactly as the title describes it's a truly captivating moment set to a very eerie drone and some guitar where Laura describes lyrically the final interaction of two people who have been cheating essentially and are now planning to make good or make better on the vows they have taken with other people while it's always good to live up to your promises I can't help but feel like there's a supreme amount of tragedy to what's going on between these two people now it might be the way that Laura straddles singing and talking on this track but there is something supremely Bill Callahan about the song hope we meet again maybe it's the fact that both of them just have these similarly steady assuring voices that I can't get enough of and while I wish the song here didn't me enter quite so much the touches of pedal steel throughout the instrumental are quite nice we then get the amazingly lovely for you the closer I alluded to earlier which brings things back to the more motherly themes of the record and the title some of the best and most loving lyrics on the entire record turn up here don't be surprised if you listen to this one and miss your mom so yeah this thing was my favorite Laura Marling record by a mile - it was quite lovely quite nice wonderfully performed and mixed assembled sure very dry not super technical not super groundbreaking or experimental or out there for an album in this genre but chock-full of personality great stories good songs and a lot of passion and emotion - and sometimes you know that's that's that's really all you need that's just enough that's just enough to make a great album to make a great listening experience that you want to come back to again and again and again something that really gives you warm fuzzy and sometimes heartbreaking sensations - I'm feeling a strong 8 to light 9 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that up or the

yTWc9cdON44,hi everyone could hear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new horror albums spirituality and distortion this is a new full-length LP from Frances own egor a metal project masterminded by producer and multi-instrumentalist gautier serre after about 15 years now of being an active music act we are now getting igor's sixth full-length LP and it's essentially the latest effort in an ongoing series of avant-garde fusions of breakbeats metal riffs baroque strings and operatic vocals and sure while the egora formula has not changed up all that rapidly over the years I can't think of many metal bands that come to even a similar balance of influences for better or for worse as igor's music tends to run a little over-the-top or extreme depending on how much black metal death metal or grindcore you have been exposed to previously however excess can be appealing under certain conditions and even when Igor is pushing my patience or the boundaries of good taste I'm still in admiration as to how daring all of it is it's certainly more challenging and refreshing than a lot of stuff out there even when knowing pretty much what to expect going into this LP this album stands as Igor's longest record to date at just under an hour in length which is pretty significant even 30 minutes of music from Igor can be pretty draining with its abusively mixed guitars and drums relentless transitions can't be classical nods it's a lot and while you can accuse spirituality and distortion of a lot of things holding back is not one of them so I did have a somewhat reserved excitement going into this LP for all those reasons I just stated also because there were a few good teasers to this record and on top of it I thought Igor's last full-length LP was pretty good so given that it was pretty interesting to hear this record open up with a bit of a surprise the track down grey desert is one of a few moments here where Igor begins to work in some elements of Arabian folk music it also happens on the enjoyably goofy and EDM inspired camel dance floor not really sure if this is going to be an ongoing or sound for Igor into the future but the appropriation of the sound is pretty surface-level as it works into Igor's usual mix of crisp metal drums and heavy riffs as well as grand showy vocals like anything else overall it's an OK intro the guitars get a bit tedious and it's not the best songwriting on the entire LP but kudos to the very tight production and vocal layering the track nervous waltz does live up to its title as the kick off of the song does sound like some very whimsical strings that would make for a very regal waltz Igor building on that essentially with some harpsichord some choral vocals also more punchy metal drums the black metal transition that breaks into the song suddenly is pretty immense along with the eerie vocal and piano combo that follows right after the ending is pretty crushing too but God is the first leg of this track gaudy the track very noise was an excellent teaser to this thing though it sounds very much unlike a lot of this album as it saves straightforward mix of breakcore and metal riffs either way it's a very visceral song and leaves a large impact as well despite being so short hollow tree with its persistently annoying harpsichord chords also contributes to the first leg of this album being a little rough the operatic singing on the track doesn't do it many favors either but things do pick up slightly with camel dancefloor that I mentioned earlier along with Papa featuring corpse grinder of cannibal corpse Fame on vocals who sounds absolutely savage but really it's the super glitchy electronics and rhythmic switch ups in the background that really sell the song and add a lot of flair I can't say I enjoyed a new set maximum though which is a very Frenchy accordion piece which of course is backed with more pummeling metal drums even though I do appreciate the combination of sounds Igor brings to the table this track just sounds really gimmicky and horrendous it's not much better when a similar instrumental palette turns up on the closing track to Himalaya massive ritual is the longest cut on the record certainly feels like it too the song has a pretty winding structure as well as these righteous hellish chords matching up with a very cultivo Harmony's for a few moments the track does get quite droney but generally I do wish it was a bit more meditative and transcendental that would have certainly made for an interesting switch up in the tracklist but I do feel like what I'm getting here I could already get in spades on like a liturgy record unfortunately the track lost in introspection ends up being a major mark against the record - there's not even anything remotely interesting or novel about the tacky combo of breakbeats and baroque pianos this track brings to the table we're not even two minutes in before the sound of this song is redundant and stale thankfully the records final leg does have at least a few highlights packed within it paranoid bulldozer italiano is not just an amazing song title also it's another moment where the breakbeat electronics and glitches come back with a vengeance syncing up really aggressively with the operatic vocals on the track which occasionally do get a bit screaming which I do like it does make them feel a bit more in step with the metal instrumentation going on in the background as opposed to just being laid on top either way the track features are great ending a good progression - meanwhile with polyphonic rust which is pretty low on gimmicks we get some of the heaviest slowest riffs on the entire record some stunning vocal passages to that layer really well while there's nothing super out there or left-field about this track it is just nice to hear something that has played pretty straight and just composed and performed well to bring it back to the closer once more unfortunately the everything but the kitchen sink approach to this one just leaves it feeling obnoxious with all of this Eastern Bloc folk meeting up with the most pompous metal drums on the entire record I don't get why the drumming is so relentless on so many tracks here there are just moments where they distract from everything going on on top of them overall with this record personally I felt like this was one of yours more mixed experiences the grandiosity ambition and versatility really does help out a good chunk of this record but there are also moments where that works to the album's detriment as Igor just kind of comes together with fusions of instrumentation and musical styles that just feel a bit silly and you know what knowingly so in the past Gautier has made it pretty apparent that he doesn't take himself or what he does in Igor too seriously and while I to see the appeal and some of the weirdest combinations of ideas here I don't know if I am enjoying them as much as I am just kind of gawking at them and wanting to move on immediately to something else feeling a decent two strong five on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Igor forever 
TXWQ_pl76Y0,hi everyone lose the knees soft Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Strokes record the new abnormal this is the latest full-length LP from legendary New York rock band The Strokes Julian Casablancas Albert Nick Nikolai and fab are back with a new collection of songs seven years after what many fans consider to be their worst full-length album the comedown machine now that I've made you mad I do apologize but still you know a lot a lot of strokes fans don't really care for that record so while it's been seven years since that record this time period has not been entirely fruitless after all we got two pretty great records from Julian Casablancas the voids and Albert Hammond Jr put out some solo records as well that had songs on them they really did so it was just this past February the band began teasing toward this record with the first single at the door that and every track from it since has been weird to some degree combine that with the title of this thing also the Basquiat artwork that serves as the cover along with the fact that Rick Rubin none other than Rick Rubin has produced this thing we may be in for the oddest strokes album yet even hotter than angles in one breath while the record is pretty boundary-pushing for the band it's also a little regressive too as a Strokes record hasn't sounded this messy and distorted since is this it simultaneously all over this LP the band is taking vocal and instrumental risks that you can't find on any previous project also much of the songwriting on this LP tends to be long winding some of the lengthiest stroke songs yet we have one five minute cut after another on this thing which on average is kind of long for a stroke song there's even the track eternal summer which does feel like an eternity and we will get into why later but the opening track the adults are talking I think is a pretty peppy start to the project with its quirky sequence drums upbeat groove and twangy thin guitar leads that are just propelling the track in that classic way they do in many store songs the band then suddenly switches gears into these low-key alluring groovy verses where Julian plays it super sensual and while the song itself is good the band progresses through way more transitional moments and instrumental bridges then I think they need to you have a solo portion around the two-minute mark around the four-minute mark a whole section in the second half devoted just to Julian pulling out this insane falsetto that is actually really gratifying this is just way more elongated than stroke songs typically are but since what is being drawn out is so good I'm here for it we then go into a moodier direction with the following cut selfless it's a ballad kicks off with some watery arpeggios that sound like the intro to a beach house song but then they're met pretty quickly with some simple bass and drums Julian's voice as well and The Strokes vibe just takes over I absolutely love how Julian's voice extends on the chorus of this thing just ascending through this multi-phased hook that just brings me higher and higher and higher into a state of sadness it's overtaking me the depression ow from here we get an instrumental bridge another hook it's a very roundabout way of structuring a rock track but still I like it following this we have the track Brooklyn Bridge two chorus which I do love but this is my impression of me first hearing this track Rick Rubin what the fuck are you doing are you kidding me bro goddamn the song is compressed to hell the synthesizer leads on the intro are searing I would not recommend a headphone listen on this one the drums come off almost like static some of the time and why do the main synth chords of the track suddenly like drop in volume and change in tone partway through both verses at different points that's just one of many weird sonic qualities to this track the chords are also derivative as fuck by the way I have no idea how the strokes are getting away with this and not being sued by some random synth pop group from decades ago however I guess it's pretty meta given Julian's references to 80s music in the lyrics either way I still think it's a solid tune fantastic hook and the noisy mix and layering along with the kitchen sink instrumentation I think plays in generally to the oddity of the album well new friends but they don't want me we then transition into a track that the more I listen to it the colder I grow toward it bad decisions so many parts of this track are painfully derivative and I know about the Billy Idol writer credit I'm not even talking just about that but that damn intro guitar line on this song - also feels like a straight 80s ripoff anyway the tight transitions of chirpy guitars and driving drums are pretty classic strokes but I can't say I'm crazy about the very repetitive OneNote one-dimensional chorus on this thing a Mick and bad decisions making bad decisions not only is the instrumentation coming together in a way that's a bit too sloppy but also there are way better hooks deeper into the project however the rough patch on this album does continue into the track eternal summer which is my least favorite track here from the deafening blast of keys and guitar layers on the intro to Julien's goofy choirboy falsetto it's a rough ride then the band is if the track weren't weird enough transitions periodically into these heavy screamed Pink Floyd inspired rock passages which if you don't think they sound like Floyd wait till the third time they bring it back where it sounds the most floyd ish these spots sound like a damn leftover from the wall thankfully things pick up with the track at the door which the more I listen to it the more I realize it's actually one of my favourite stroke songs ever I love how skeletal and dry and somehow dramatic the intro is very stark as well with the presentation of just these burning synthesizers that are very fat and just a very aggressive very in-your-face very bright and then Julian's voice and that's it and the lyrics are kind of frightening - a little bit of a sense of dread coming through on them with Julian singing about needing to escape something or not being able to make it out of something then this ghostly set of since sets the tone for Julian's singing this line about something striking him like a chord and then all of a sudden the guitars pop in AHA funny interesting Bart got it and once they pop in damn I'm just floating it's amazing it's it it is a blissful depression I'm high but simultaneously I am feeling those lines about sinking like a stone which is one of a few points on the track where Julien likens himself to an object of some sort especially one that's being used like use me like an oar to get yourself to shore which brings up these sentiments of self-sacrifice deeper into the track another surreal moment where Julien turns into an object he's singing about being a cannonball slamming through your wall then the bridge instrumentation on the track turns pretty heavenly and we move into a psychedelic finish toward the very end and yeah just a very odd series of shifts and changes throughout this track that I think are really cool why are Sunday's so depressing is a pretty slick and swagger packed rock song where Julien's weirdo charisma is off the charts the hooks on this track see a transition suddenly into these very squelchy I think envelope synthesizers and Julian's voice being slathered in these robotic effects it is a very weird aesthetic shift but somehow one that works and at least much better than the ones that were on eternal summer in the album's final moments we have the track not the same anymore which is an absolutely depressing and low-key song with a lot of crying guitar leads I couldn't quite put my finger on it but there is something about those lead melodies and the chord progression on this track too that reminds me of another song but I can't think of the specific track but still there were moments that read to me as being a little inspired by my guitar gently weeps or babe I'm gonna leave you or lover I don't have to love it's that kind of drama the chorus on this track again feels like classic strokes but slowed down to the point where it's a bit sludgy ER and mushy ER which at first feel a bit awkward but I will say the more extended bits of these hooks are pretty sweet to the ear and melodically ambitious there's a real emotional exorcism type quality to them too then to top things off we have the track ode to the Mets which is one of the more grad fiying slow burners here yet another song whose numerous parts all feel like they're being borrowed from somewhere else and recontextualized in a way where it's hard to tell what their origin is exactly anyway the appeal of this one I think is its linear nature where everything about the track the vocals the instrumentation grows more and more intense but somehow is I guess kind of rocking me into a sad quarantined slumber overall I was pretty impressed with this record I'm glad that The Strokes did this album I'm glad that it is as left-field as it seems to be on the surface anyway I don't know exactly how much forethought went into a lot of the weirder ideas on this project honestly but either way the band comes through with way more hits than misses and despite my major enjoyment of this LP along with it being in my opinion one of the Bands most exciting records to date I will forever be skipping eternal summer but seriously cheers to the band for coming through with an album titled the new abnormal and it actually lives up to the title I am feeling a strong 70 will light 8 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana The Strokes forever 
Hs3Bfg_5t8Q,hi everyone stormthan the outside tano here the internet's busiest music nerd hope you are doing well and it's time for a review of the new blade project exeter this is a new collection of songs from drain gang artist sweden's very own blade over the past several years the drain gang has forged a very dreamy synthetic abstract futuristic brand of cloud wrap that has gained quite the cult following and while i myself have been impressed by a select few tie boy digital tracks as well as that new echo 2k project e that i thought for the most part was very good i can't really lay claim to any enjoyment of blades work thus far my review of his 2018 lp red light is pretty notorious for being one of my most negative reviews ever and the mixtape he followed this project up with in that same year to me felt like just more of the same while there is a part of me that does appreciate the aesthetics of these projects and what they are shooting for the songs are just way too anemic and the vocals absolutely suck to the point where there's no amount of auto-tune or touching up that one could do to make them sound good make them make sense in these very synthetic euphoric and serene instrumentals but those are my opinions of blade's older work maybe in the time since red light he has evolved quite a bit artistically which led me to being curious about his new project over here this relatively short collection of nine tracks which when i heard them i ran into a lot of familiar issues as well as new and refreshing ideas for one the production on this is far more varied and intriguing than anything i think blade has featured on a record in the past like the plinky delayed synths and shimmering chimes on mirror which sound like the start of a beautiful lullaby or it's more like the soundtrack to being transported to the crystal dimension i also love the very woozy and skeletal beat on the track wonderland which features a lot of cute low-key tones matched with these rubbery stretching sound effects that are pretty strange they just squeak away through the mix and don't really line up with much harmonically here but they they are pretty stimulating and on every moment special we get these psychedelic swirls of tones combined with these chilly stuttering vocal samples that just sound like these little choruses calling away many sounds in the mix are soaked in this vast reverb the whole thing is just very pristine it's hypnotic pretty surreal as well then we have the wondrous and gorgeous music box synths on the track love story which comes off a bit bjork inspired to my ears but the very minimal and malformed bass and drums underneath all of that gives it a very different vibe so the production on this project generally i found to be a lot more textured creative and oddly enough complementary to blades very weird mediocre vocals to take it back to the track love story in a way the pretty but demented beat on this one complements the emotionally flat understated and auto-tuned vocals that bleed brings to the table i will say though that echo 2k's very eerie falsetto does carry the track quite a bit either way this is actually the first blade song i think i can say i enjoyed the vocals on dna reign weren't all that bad either but i feel like the only reason that's the case is they were digitized to the point where i feel like i'm listening to an ai try to get in touch with its emotions which is a really odd feeling given it's happening over this very heavenly and euphoric beat so i guess the appeal of the vocals on this one is they're so touched up that the room for human error is almost gone there's a similar appeal to the track rainbow star 2 in that the production is just so pillowy it kind of takes the edge off of blade singing but still for the most part as much as i am trying to see the silver lining in many songs on this project the singing still kind of stinks there are even moments on this thing where the repetitive lyrics and the very nasally vocals border on that of a nav song wonderland is another moment where the vocal personality and skills of echo 2k are very clearly a cut above at least one or two or three cuts above that of blade i mean both have had the same amount of time since red light to evolve and somehow echo's vocals have managed to uh mature quite a bit meanwhile i feel like blade is mostly stuck in the same spot take the track merry-go-round for example i can't really say anything about the singing on this one other than that it's painfully subpar the warbly auto-tune on the track somehow makes it worse too but as much as i would like to see the vocals improved on this thing the songwriting could use some work as well not that it's terrible but on some tracks it can come off a little one-dimensional under-structured i suppose a lot of the tracks here are impressionistic in nature like many songs off of echo 2k's recent project but i feel like in order to get away with that the songs need to be coming together as a whole on your record in a significant way or every sounder idea going into each track needs to be next level and i i feel like that's not truly the case for exeter while i did find some very admirable qualities about these tracks so they are quirky they are alluring they are very imaginative with their approach to production after this i think you could certainly call me blade curious i'm still kind of torn on this though because i think there's so many aspects of it that could be vastly vastly improved i'm feeling a strong five on this one tran position have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please

qFxWWDH8Ifk,hi hi hi everyone Anthony Phan Tiano here Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for another edition of the weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were some of the best and of the worst tracks of the week we have quite a few quite a few quite a few a lot to do so let's get into it I think first we have to do a a few shout outs to some links down below our turntable lab link our patreon page linked over there for a very cheap tear you can get some bonus monthly content access to our discord and a whole lot else and also this project over here that Austin has come recommending from Keith row an assemblage slash construct for 45 voices a cool choral collage by experimental guitar legend Keith Rowe not usually the type of sound or style he's dealing in but a still a pretty cool project nonetheless and I guess it's free as well and we also have a little something from avant-gardist mr. a Jim O'Rourke he makes a compelling classical piece while in his ambient steam room mode it's always nice when Austin comes through the few left field recommendations and yeah that's it for the shout outs let's get into the worst tracks of the week if it's unknown to you I will say that we always link all this stuff down below in the description box so if any of these tracks grab your attention or interest to you whether I like them or don't so much like them you can check them out down there listen to them for yourself get your own opinions going and all that but worst racks of the week the least favorites of the week our first uh sure Little John and Ludacris sex beat wow this is terrible this is bad Wow considering that uh sure and Little John back in the day like drummed up one of the greatest club hits of all time even though my thoughts on a little bit have changed because of the the triangle sort of sitting with me in a weird way these days but still one of the greatest club hits ever it's very sad to see them link up once again for a track that is so utterly shit also very disappointing that the Ludacris feature on this is so annoying to the point I don't want to listen to the song and the B is trashed - there's nothing likeable about this track I don't get why anyone want what anyone would want to dance to it fuck to it and just really listen to it it's it's annoying as fuck but whatever moving on from there we have this new single from MXM tune a california singer-songwriter that has been making a lot of waves didn't really care for her early ukulele stuff and have somewhat been interested in hearing her transition added that into just more of a straightforward pop flavor but the production on this new track over here lessons is so utterly basic and bland I wonder if she really has like a direction a style in mind of something because this just seems painfully average there there's so much more creativity going on in pop music generally that there's absolutely nothing magnetizing about this moving on from there Danzig of misfits Fame Punk legend sings Elvis which in theory is not necessarily a bad thing because if you listen to those early misfits albums and singles it's very apparent that to the COO the king who very clearly has an influence on Danzig's vocal style and maybe back in the day of Danzig you know was doing some Elvis covers on an album it would have been relatively exciting but this sucks this sucks ass this cover of one night is terrible the vocals are shit the production leaves a lot to be desired and it is just awkward as fuck I do not want to hear any more of this at all but I have a feeling I will my morbid curiosity will get the best of me at some point and we also have a new track from Alison Mosshart one of her messiest and least gratifying songs in a while whether that be a you know through another band or some other you know through way but but still having said that the vocals are boring the instrumental is absolutely gutless and asurs try to be a little fuzzy and everything but there's nothing about it compositionally that's a all that memorable it's just a very bland and messy and just want to try to forget about it as soon as possible let's get into the tracks that I thought were meh not terrible but still worth shouting out and pointing you in your direction you might enjoy them more than me first off we have a new track from woods which is a very breezy somewhat eerie funky tune I thought the production was maybe a little bit too clean or standard but but still the tune is not all that bad if you enjoy some somewhat left-field folk get into this new track strange to explain we also have a new track from washed-out chillwave King though that is not washed outs MO these days and that genre is pretty much long dead but still having said that I did love how huge and euphoric this new track was when I when I first put it on but it sort of loses flavor very quickly very very quickly as the super pillowy production and the very bland synthetic textures the only take it so far as they're not that surreal not that sonically creative or interesting or unique just ends up being a very very very so so very a flavorless sound moving on from there twenty one pilots level of concern not a bad news single from the duo goes in a bit of a disco direction not the best song I think they've ever written but I guess it is pretty cool that from a Lear angle they decide to go in a direction that is obviously inspired by the quarantine that many of us are under right now so so some quarantine pop from the duo with a disco tinge it's okay it's okay certainly it's it's intriguing to see them staying creative though it's not necessarily going toe to toe with anything off of the last record you know trench so moving on from there we have a new track from Tory Lanez who got to give a shout out to Tory Lanez here because he has absolutely been killing it killing it on instagram with those live streams people been going nuts on boats fucking streams and they have been a getting a lot of people through this quarantine it has been a super important in keeping spirits high during this whole quarantine thing so a shout out to him for that unfortunately this new single stupid again is just okay I mean it's a pretty epic beat but I feel like the production really kind of carries Tory quite a bit which has been the case for a lot of his tracks for a long time but you know at least this one is a bit grander in scope so I don't know give it a try give it a shot and I cannot not quite as a I guess lacking in personality or a singsong E as some of his other stuff so I don't know we also have a new track from Rico nasty popstar which I thought was just alright one of her more auto tune tracks with a really repetitive and somewhat obnoxious chorus you know some likeable qualities about it and it is sort of the sort of aggressive and in your face and and nasty like a Rico nasty track should be but it was it was it nasty enough could have been nastier could have been last year we also have a new track from mr. Oliver tree who decided to drop this song and music video I guess in response or in the wake of the cancellation of his tour and the pushback of his new album the name of this new cut over here is let me down and while I do think the music is pretty fun the song itself is super basic lyrically Oliver really isn't saying much of anything which is something that as I hear more and more songs from Oliver's beginning to great on me that he just doesn't really get down to anything like substantive or specific and any of in any of his songs he just sort of seems to write from this very vague place of you know don't let me dance the same old shit it's like what's the same old shit like what like what is the shit what is happening what is going on what is inspiring this I don't know like the feelings and the ideas are presented in such a vague nondescript way that it just seems like you're you're writing from a place of emotional manipulation like there's nothing actually fueling any of this it's just like this this weird idea of like I'm just gonna present myself as being fed up or unhappy with something but nobody really knows what that something is and I'm just hoping the audience will project those feelings that they may be having on to this song for whatever reason but still having said that it's not like the structure of the production or the the you know melody on the track is all that amazing anyway either I mean it comes together well it's mixed coherently and it's got a good punch on the chorus and all that you know it's it's a progressed in a way that I think a song of this genre should be and it's always interesting to hear Oliver come together with um you know different styles of music and in a somewhat seamless way but I feel like going forward the writing has to be better as great and as the music videos and the stick and the memes and and all of that are the songs the music has got to step it up just a little bit I think we have Ed O'Brien of Radiohead Fame come through with another track this one features Laura Marling and vocally they tie up very nicely I was somewhat disappointed with how I guess the word I'm looking for is common the court progression was on this track it sort of seems like I've heard it a bunch of different times on other songs but still a cloak of the night is is not a bad one the the vocal sort of chemistry on this track definitely does sell it we also have a new track from bats Michaela corridor is the name of it and I I will say I enjoy the music video of this song I do the song itself really it's a very funny meditation on sort of like hypebeast fashion and it's it's it's it's almost like joining a cult in in the music video anyway and it's pretty funny in that sense the track itself is a bit of a departure from the very surreal and wavy beat music and pop that Baths has been built on years and years and years ago when it initially broke as a project but um I don't know I feel like nothing as exciting has really replaced that that style and that sound on this new single but I don't know I'm hoping for a more material down the road that's a bit more intriguing and and undoubtedly baths is a still a pretty creative project that is worth keeping your eyes and ears on we also have a new track from av tear which is a little tedious but still I suppose a little trippy and meditative and very um you know low-key and I suppose a little rustic in a sense as well the name of this track is wake my door it's a lengthy one too so you know if you're a big AV tear solo fan or you know just looking for some more stuff that's in an animal collective type vibe but more stripped back and more simple give it a try give it a shot and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best this week the ones that really grabbed my attention wowed me a little bit here we go strokes Brooklyn Bridge to chorus liked this one quite a bit not going to talk too much about it sorry because I am going to review the new Strokes album this week and I don't want to give too much away don't want to lay down too many thoughts but I did think this was another good teaser to the album so thoughts on the record very soon we also have a new track from our mr or rumor I think that's uh the you know sort of the the way that this may be said coming through you know past that rascal track you know the country track ballad with a song that's more in a straightforward R&B vein dealer so it's it's not as unique in style and tone and combination of influence but what did grab my attention on this track is is not only as the song pretty good but he's really singing his ass off on this song given how nasally the vocals were on rascal I I didn't know how good of a singer he actually was but singing on this track as his vocals were actually really good I was actually getting some old school our Kelly vibes and you know not to praise our Kelly too much because of you know who he is and what he is and the crimes he's committed but back in the day he was a great vocalist and RMR was certainly a rather rumor again I was certainly giving me those vibes in terms of that level of a vocal quality and personality and dynamics so I give this track a try give it a shot the vocals really did surprise me while I would love to hear more tracks sort of in that rascal vein this was really good this was very good we also have a new track from Indy darling singer-songwriter extraordinaire Phoebe Bridgers Kyoto and it sits very nicely arranged a bit of singer-songwriter music impassioned vocals as well certainly hit me harder than a lot of stuff off of her debut which so many people seem to be enamored with definitely got me looking forward to what she has coming down the pipe in 2020 so I will leave it at that excuse me obnoxious youth is a group that I am now just finding out about mouths sewn shut is the name of this track that I want to point in your direction and it's got some elements of noise and grindcore but also some amazing guitar work as well like really some some awesome soloing and shredding which is really clean and almost pretty in a way and flashy it's very rare that you hear these combos of sounds I feel like we should have heard that like a million times by now but I love the roughness the abrasiveness of this but simultaneously like how impressive some of the musicianship is especially since you know those leads and those melodies coming out of the guitar does make the mayhem just like a little bit sweeter you know and doesn't make it a bit more memorable you know not just like a blitzkrieg of noise you know hitting your ears that's sort of indiscernible it's actually uh got a got a strong flavor to it so uh like in this one quite a bit we also have this track from masterpiece machine that I am now just hearing about and keep in mind this is the first track I'm hearing from this project rotting fruit I'm looking forward to hearing more but this is like a really weird combination of heavy neo psyche with like an alt rock or maybe even like an alt metal edge very odd combination of sounds but I liked it quite a bit there were some clean vocals on the song but I don't know if I was too crazy about but everything else about the song was really wow me to the point where I maybe sort of won over by those after a few more listens anyway but still this is a really fun this is a really fun track and it will be a trying to keep my ear to the ground for more material from this project to see if there's anything else from it that I'm digging so we also have aries a new song from the new single video multimedia series from gorillas song machine right now I think areolas are three for three on this series the song features Georgia and Peter Hook it's pretty much in a new order vein I give a lot more thoughts on this on a review over on the Fantana channel and yeah I just think it's a really good track think it's a lovely track even if maybe maybe a lot of my enjoyment of it is due to a big new order bias and just wanting to hear more like that but I guess we're going to do that sort of thing you might as well have Peter Hook on the goddamn song moving on from there we have new track from Charli XCX forever a really abrasive production it's but a Charlie super sweet hook and vocal line on that hook does make it go down pretty nicely pretty easy I'm really looking forward to this new record she has coming out in May and I think it's a really admirable of her to strike while the iron is hot and give us something really off to listen to in the midst of this insane pandemic shit so a hell yes Charli XCX loving this new single we also have a new track from black dresses which is a almost like a weird rock-oriented cut seems a little grungy in a way and very sad very dejected like the vocals on it like how heavy and just dark and bleak the instrumental is too and black dresses is something I've been keeping my eyes on for a little bit since some of their Bandcamp stuff kind of popped off for me so uh digging this looking forward to maybe hearing more stuff like this down the pipe though I know that black dresses is very much a project that is kind of in flux in a way stylistically who knows what the hell they're gonna come up with next so I don't know I'm liking what I'm hearing here let's see if we like more stuff coming out in the future we have a new track from Bower as well electronic music producer known for Harlem shake and all that of course but still coming through the banger of a different stripe and flavor almost like some rock-oriented Ridge going on during some points of the song it hits pretty hard it's pretty hard reminds me of like some old breakbeat shit that was super aggressive back in the day but without you know doing any big break beats or you know doing anything too dated or like you know nostalgic or anything like that just kind of reminded me of some really aggressive electronic music from the 90s but modernized in a way I'm liking it quite a bit we have a new remix over here of all mirrors Johnny Jewell doing this angel Olsen track over here and I thought it was a pretty cool revision of the instrumental and all that so give that a try and Antichrist demon core very much looking forward to this album coming around the pipe some really awesome grind in power violence here a hellish hellish hellish and muscular muscular beast eale is the last thing I'll say about it the new track over here that I want to point in your direction is cop sucker and of course 100 X comes through the fantastic a remix of get to you churring none other than Doreen Electra awesome crossover amazing crossover exactly what you want exactly what you need to hear love that gex continue to be creative and love hearing the king my liege during Electra come through and not totally kill it on the vocal on the revision the remix of this a very great high-quality track from from the thousand decks record and that is it that is gonna be it for this video hopefully you guys got some good recommendations out of this that has been the weekly track roundup once more all of it is linked down below if you want to a check any of it out for yourself I will see you guys in the next video anthony Fantan au weekly track roundup of forever 
P7mLMSo17jc,
el7NTXDuaCo,hi everyone anthony fantano here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new four tet album 16 oceans this is the newest full-length lp from internationally known and celebrated electronic music producer kieran hebden aka forte and now after what's been essentially two decades of music we are finally getting his tenth full-length album truth be told the past decade or so has not been the most riveting for forte not nearly as revolutionary or as groundbreaking as his fantastic folk tronica work in the 2000s nor as captivating as his forays into micro house on 2010s there is love in you beautiful rewind did have its moments but for the most part it was just so packed with tons of forgettable tracks morning evening was a pretty ambitious project given its two very lengthy pieces but the progressions of both tracks left a lot to be desired so i was hoping 2017's new energy would be the last in this faint series of releases from hebden but this new one all it's done for me is making me miss what vortet was doing three years ago i guess the record doesn't start off too bad the track school features some glistening synth passages that are set to some very groovy and patient beats it sounds part meditation soundtrack part microscopic dance party for glow stick wielding fairies that are just in an idyllic forest setting the track baby is even better with its driving kicks and atmospheric production chopped up vocal samples that are placed throughout that remind me a bit of burial but by comparison hebden's approach is a lot less dramatic more calculated so again the start of the album is fine but it doesn't take long for the tracklist to start dropping the semi-ambient compositions that just really kill the record's momentum the track harpsichord features these mind-numbing airy chords that just cycle and cycle and cycle what's worse is on top of them hebden places these really cheap sounding synthetic harpsichords that they just sound very thin and very fake it's kind of like i'm listening to some really bad low budget new age music later on the record the track romantics very much sounds like the same thing but if you crossed it with a bit of study beats music same thing with the track green but if you crossed it with some idm teenage bird song by comparison has a bit more of a pulse to it but it's not much better with an equally numbing set of chords in the background but now it's topped with these trying to be chill but actually kind of awkward woodwind melodies that uh it's it's like hebden's trying to make some rainforest beat music deeper into the record we get more stagnants with weird combinations of sounds for example the prickly and plucky strings all over insect near piha beach sound completely disconnected from the beat running underneath them why are we getting these two things together if they're not going to reinforce each other in any significant way why not just put really any sound on top of this beat at this point something in sadness is almost as frustrating with it's very mushy and aimless and swirling wall of synthesizers topping its beat but at least it syncs up with the rhythms pretty tightly for some strange reason the end of the record is spent dishing out one semi-ambient piece after another the track 4t recordings features a very vast atmosphere that is covering these small passionate vocal runs as they're backed with this very meditative bass drone that is being orbited by some sound effects of birds chirping the whole thing gets pretty stale pretty fast i do like the build up it presents at the very end but it just bows out immediately after that climax feeling really i guess uh unsatisfying this is for you is so hollow and uneventful i'm not really sure what to say about it outside of it sounding like what you would get if you took some of the piano bits from brian eno's windows 95 work and uh just soak them in reverb and delay mama teaches sanskrit the closer of the record does feature some pretty swells it is uh relatively serene there's some pretty intriguing sound play to the track but uh all i'm left wondering is why couldn't uh any number of much shorter semi-ambient interludes and bits earlier on the record that just feel like filler uh why couldn't they have been built out or just featured i guess more engaging sounds like this i'm talking about tracks like 1993 band practice hi hello the only other major highlight for me on this lp was love salad which is the longest track on the record not by a whole lot but it somehow feels way more robust than 90 of the material here the beat on this thing is actually pretty hypnotic the groove locked me in instantaneously meanwhile the intensifying synth leads of the track remind me quite a bit of the subtle and wondrous progressions all over there is loving you it features one engaging passage after the next and a pretty decent ending but it's rare that 16 oceans excites or stuns in this way or anyway really because for me this was a record that was really unsure of what it was and what it wanted to be is it an ambient record is it a blend of house or techno or idm and not that these styles can't exist under one roof certainly they can and have on many fantastic records in the past but the way they are combined on this project it's like their most unique characteristics are all canceling each other out it also doesn't help that much of the sound play the synth timbres as well as the compositions and melody writing i find to be pretty uninspired on a lot of the record too so this might be my least favorite fortet record ever i don't like thinking that or saying that but i guess it is what it is i'm feeling a decent two strong four on this one tran position have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe

RlRvesjS9rE,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new eve tumor record heaven to a tortured mind this is the newest full-length LP from eve tumor a music project spearheaded by multi-instrumentalist producer singer/songwriter sean bowie it is his second full-length album for the warp label which is hotly anticipated considering how much excitement his breakout LP stirred back in 2018 which was an intriguing mix of psychedelic hypnagogic pop and rock with a slightly experimental edge with this album Bowie was certainly giving off the vibe of a weirdo auteur not too much unlike a Dean Blunt or an Ariel pink or a James Ferraro but what ended up standing out on this record to me were the hooker tracks that surprisingly enough had a bit of a Brit pop influence to them like the fantastic single noid which sounds like it's straight out of London straight out of the mid 90s with these groovy beats and bass and a somewhat snotty English affectation on the vocals and the genre continues to be a big influence on many tracks here but most importantly this is the most groomed tracklist of any record that Bowie has put together so far and he doesn't totally give up his more experimental tendencies to get there while many of the songs on this record are relatively straightforward the oddity of Bowie's work shows up in the dark warped or abrasive subversions he packs into the production whether that be on a track that again has more of a Britpop influence or some of the songs here that surprisingly cross over into glam rock like the sweet and sexy highlight superstars there's also a super strong hip-hop influence on the opening track gospel for a new country the way this tracks chunky blaring horn samples slap against the beat it sounds super villainous almost like a piece of MF DOOM production but Bowie - this instrumental manages to ingeniously write a very dark and tortured rock song about this girl leaving his life needing her to light his fire and all that it's like part Marilyn Manson part Jim Morrison with a touch of Damon Albarn in there - in fact I wouldn't be surprised to see an Eve tumor feature on a gorilla's record at some point in the future of course there are plenty of other songs in the track here that are well-structured creatively produced like the track identity trade featuring these dejected vocals very groovy bass and drums again topping that with these very noisy harsh shots of tones that are kind of industrial in a sense the track is short but doesn't bow out feeling unsatisfying or half-baked Bowie somehow strikes up something equally satisfying on the even shorter romanticist later on the record also one of a few moments here that reads like some pretty blatant aerial pink worship the fantastic kerosene is a moody righteous rock duet featuring Diana Gordon considering how the track borrows from Uriah heaps we've been silence the vague allusions to hard rock and progressive rock are not all that surprising the blunt and seductive lyrics the super flashy guitar solo all of which is presented with this great dreamy surreal background instrumentation but it's truly the vocal chemistry on the song that really sells it even more of a mindfuck though is the song dream palette where Bowie's love of sound collage translates into a wondrous mix of fireworks and fractured guitars and layered chunks of drum fills all of this eventually transitions into one of the darkest grooves on the entire record with some of the most harrowing vocals on the entire record some of which come from guest vocalists Julia cumming who sounds like a hardrock heroine on the track so there are great tracks peppered throughout the album no doubt but like with safe in the hands of love there are some truly confounding and underwhelming moments on this thing - mostly tracks that do actually feel half-baked like cast ellen lights which fades in and out without doing much to leave an impression and yet there is too much going on to pass it off merely as just some fleeting interlude there are also a few cuts that suffered due to Bowie not really mustering up the same charisma in his vocals that make the best tracks on here stand out like be very sleepy and Spacey Foley and Posey which sounds like a combination of ganga for the Cure if you force them to collaborate on a dark wave synth goth song or the track strawberry privilege - which I didn't care for too much when I first heard it but the squeaky strange falsetto vocals do juxtapose pretty interestingly against the very chilling girl group style harmonies that color the background of most of the track the instrumental - is pretty dramatic despite being so skeletal the records final moments are just so so unfortunately asteroid blues doesn't seem to be much more than just a blaring motif with a lot of pomp it doesn't do much more than just kill time before we reach the somewhat disappointing closer which ends up being another slow soulful hypnagogic jam that is not too much unlike Ariel pink in aesthetic and tone sounds like something that could have even been on before today the dreamy and somewhat jazzy instrumental transition around the midway point is not bad but it doesn't develop into anything all that climactic overall though I would still say this is a very good record and maybe a slight slight slight slight slight improvement over what Bowie had done on the previous Eve tumor album his vision and his sound his style is clearer and bolder than ever but the inconsistent flow the one-dimensional tracks and the very weak ending leave me wanting more I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Eve tumor the forever 
AMKnqlZzRcM,
mMY3eoqp0kg,hi everyone bad Annie back Hannah you're the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Thundercat album it is what it is this is the latest full-length LP from singer-songwriter bass virtuoso Thundercat it is Thundercats fourth full-length LP and comes several years after what I think is his most popular and most widely acclaimed album drunk which for me was another album in the Thundercat discography that featured great playing sharp humor interesting song ideas but was hindered ultimately by the week production and sound quality that made Apocalypse such a disappointing listen not to mention the numerous tracks off of this record that just felt underwritten like filler however I did go into it is what it is with higher hopes as this seemed to be a trimmer album trimmer tracklist with an impressive and eccentric list of featured guests and on top of that there were at least a few teaser tracks that I thought were especially good now aesthetically the sound of this record isn't that much different than the usual blend of sounds and influences that have gone to the Thundercats previous LP s it is a spacey and psychedelic fusion of jazz soul and funk with some very good bass lines the problem though is once again the production and the mixing leave a lot to be desired the beats and grooves on many of these tracks are so faint a little muddy not a whole lot of punch meanwhile the the vocals are so soaked in reverb to overcompensate for the fact that the Thundercats fall said it was not the best also the way the instrumentation is balanced on some of these tracks leads to them sounding needlessly tangled or noisy like on the track house way or even interstellar love which mind you is a track on this record I want to love I want I want to love this track it's Thundercats skillfully playing against some smooth sax and aggressive jazz fusion drumming this is the kind of instrumental palette and musical chemistry I've been dying to hear on a Thundercat album but drums sound terrible there are a few points of this track where the mix starts sounding like it's clipping which is a terrible sound to hear when you are trying to convey no this intergalactic jazz space vibe then there are tracks on this LP like funny thing which almost suffer from the opposite issue where the beat and synths and vocals are far too thin hollow in rudimentary to really make much of an impact I have similar issues with the track unrequited love where the songs very scratchy high hats and stiff kick snare pattern don't do much for the excellently voiced bass lines and lavish layers of strings on top of them also while this record is on the shorter side it's still packed with a lot of very short and inconsequential songs that are kind of hard to forgive when the more robust tracks on here are a little unsatisfying to the track overseas kicks off nicely enough has one of the better chord progressions on the entire record but it devolves into this kind of silly tongue-in-cheek novelty song about getting head on an airplane with rapper and comedian Zack Fox popping into the mix as an airline pilot over the intercom which didn't go over as hilariously as I hoped it would the song how I feel is a cool transitional moment in the tracklist but would I have enjoyed this more if it extended into something a bit more substantive maybe meanwhile the funny lyrics on Miguel's happy to answer just about the only thing keeping this track from being a total loss as the song itself is pretty forgettable and sounds like something Thundercat is written already however I'm not entirely against the inclusion of existential dread in the tracklist here as it sounds like a very cool intro to the closing track the title track of the album which I would like to use as a jump off point to say that you know what there are actually some great highlights on this LP it's not all bad or disappointing most of the tracks on this LP I would say range from decent but needs improvement to great the track I love Luis Cole is a tribute to multi-instrumentalist wizard Luis Cole who is featured on the song as well there is also an amazing finale to the song with this descending chord progression with the very punchy and fast instrumentation of the background it sounds like the intro theme to an amazing adventure anime the track black Qualls featuring Steve Lacey Steve our Anton and a childish gambino is a fantastic combination of soul and funk with some sweet vocal harmonies one of Thundercats most expressive bass lines ever as well as some psychedelic synths and strings thickening up the back end not to mention each guest feature is better than the one before it we then get Dragonball do-rag and the track is about the the most unsexy thing you can imagine with mentions of video games and comics and having cat hair all over you but but you know still smashing in your Dragonball do-rag the track king of the hill meanwhile is a much moodier piece with some chilling electric piano on the intro which leads into a song about leading a hedonistic life chasing after a lot of thrills and the costs that come with that and the closing track is a wonderfully sad and dramatic moment on the record where Thundercat gives one of his most intimate vocal performances even if it's couched in the same space and somewhat muddy production a lot of the other tracks here are too because it is a great song with a fantastic chord progression very expressive bass playing and phrasing from Thundercat on top of it I think the barren wasteland wind blowing in the background does add a lot I should mention the track fair chance which I thought could have been better but really only because little bees feature was so awkward other than that I thought Thundercats vocals his compositional edge on this track as well as tight dolla sign's appearance to all work together really cohesively didn't really dig the fact that little bee decided to sing on this one in such in out-there way but it is what it is I guess when it comes to little bee expect the unexpected and whatever he gives you you you most likely should use it so despite my complaints and I do have complaints about this record I still found it to be a likeable album it just suffers from a lot of the same issues the Thundercats previous LPS have though I imagine at this point he's put out so much material he is making his music sound exactly the way he wants it to sound I'm still not sure though why he wouldn't want his recordings to the better clearer punch year more texturally rich especially given he seemed to be a lot more ambitious with the instrumentation and the vocal guests on this one I mean I'm sure there are a ton of very talented producers who would give their left nut to be on a Thundercat record I suppose this album is not as shoddily put together as Apocalypse was it's not nearly as cumbersome as drunk either but still lands in the middle despite its compositional shining moments and it's more impressive songs I'm feeling eight decent too strong six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the

1Q2YZ010HS8,hey hey hi hello hi hey hi hey hi hello hi hey hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you are doing well it is time for another edition of our weekly track roundup where I tell you what I thought were some of the best and the worst tracks of the week shall we shall we everyone shall we shall we go through these tracks I think we shall remember they're all listed down below like usual like usual so if you guys are curious about anything I'm talking about in this video it's down there along with our turntable lab link which we get kick back from hit it up hit it up hit it up especially if you're looking to buy some vinyl a turntable as something and also our patreon page is down there to get some extra bonus monthly content for a very cheap tear and support the channel and everything that we do cool cool all right also a few more shout outs of one panoptic on has a like a new little charity band camp thing out couple of tracks you know it's it's just a material that hardcore fans some recordings hardcore fans haven't heard before and apparently proceeds are going toward bands and artists that are you know have are connected to or personal friends of panoptic on who's you know livelihoods are essentially being threatened by their tours being cancelled because of the whole you know kovat thing so community's trying to come together and just get something together you know alright also Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance Fame has seen fit to drop like a handful of clips on on his soundcloud don't know if any of this is like meant to be any sort of My Chemical Romance kind of thing I'm anticipating no but still of the clips that he did drop sound pretty cool especially the the one track that sounded like a pretty full song there but all of them were pretty neat in their own way and got me wondering like what's what's bubbling up what's bubbling up in Gerard's mind during this point in time where he should be like working on and in album of some sort also I want to give a shout out to this live at Hyde Street studio session from Sun Kil moon mark kozilek he has come through with this cool little you know quarantine session a lot of them musicians are coming through with live streams you know studio sessions just to kind of hold fans over so they can you know just either raise money or just kind of raise funds for the artists and the band's because look with with live shows kind of being in the toilet right now everybody's trying to you know keep people engaged entertained and streaming music studios I imagine our hit pretty hard as well which is why this session seems to be on the Hyde Street Studios YouTube channel we will link you to that down below where you can hear this session this recording so give it a try give it a shot all right let's move into what I felt were the worst the worst tracks of the week we have a handful of tracks that I did not like some of which may surprise you so but BAM first this this one shouldn't surprise you I mean I have not been enjoying anything from this new purity ring albums cycle nor have I really been a fan of purity ring up until this point anyway but just think the duo's very mild approach to electronic pop music is super bland way overdone and I don't know just not just not very high impact I guess so I don't know their sound just continues to be a Miss for me and this new record I I may not even pay that much attention to it I really don't know at this point moving on from there fish have a new record out Sigma Oasis is the track that we are talking about here from the record of the same title and yeah I am not into it it sounds like what you would get if you made boring country music and try to progressive rock it up I guess a little bit but the playing wasn't like super mind-blowing anyway I know there are a lot of hardcore fish fans out there some of which are in my audience and are excited to hear my thoughts on this record after previewing this track and some others from the album I am not liking it so far I will continue to think about this record I guess but do not get your hopes high for me to kind of come through and say hey guys it's actually amazing because I'm most likely not going to do that you know if it somehow turns out that I wake up one morning and I have an epiphany and fish is my most favorite band of all time that I guess you know I will do a 180 I'll update you on that change I will let you know but as of right now that is not the case and the chances of that change look very unlikely look very very unlikely so moving on from there Orville Peck summertime I haven't really spoken about Orville Peck at length in a lot of videos up until this point because I think his music and I think his sound has a ton of potential I mean I love the artsy dark kind of country thing that he has going on I think it's it's a new way forward I think it's something an aesthetic an idea a concept that more artists in general and in the country genre should be kind of embracing but there's just something about Orville pecks singing and voice that I do not like at all I mean not only is the singing very clearly subpar like you know there are notes and there are progressions that are just a little amiss and so many so to the point where it gets a little annoying and just difficult to listen to but there's also something weird about Orville's articulation and enunciation and and the inflection the tone of his voice - that is really off-putting for me I feel like almost as if inand I know Orville's from Canada which isn't that far removed from the US and country music in general is there tons of great country and folk artists from Canada but I feel almost as if I'm listening to an estonian cowboy impersonator i just don't really get what is just making it feel so off for me personally but it just does not sound very genuine I guess to my ears now that being said the tune of the track is great and the production is fantastic I can tell a ton of money has been sunk into this recording to make it sound as lavish and as pristine as it does because the instrumentation on this track is killer it's it's really like you know starting to woo me a little bit I did like the instrumentation on Orville's last record but this instrumentally in production wise is so much more impressive which is why it's even more disappointing to hear the vocals still sounding very very very very lacking so sadly and I'm still not into it despite the fact that I really truly want to be into it I've not been saying that much about Orville's music because I've been anticipating yeah there's there's gonna be a time he's gonna blow me the fuck away and then I'm just gonna regret everything I said about his stuff in the past and honestly I I don't know it's it's it's it's pretty like then the nails pretty much in the coffin at this point the this is what I do not like about Orval sound will that change into the future maybe could change could possibly change but as of right now and I'm just not into his voice just not into his voice at all just not and finally did baby has a new track out find my way and the baby singing not so much not not so much you know that same handful of flows he brings on every track on a good feature yes sure that's great fantastic but the baby trying to get in his feelings a little bit on this slightly mellower cut was pretty weak to my ears honestly not that I mind the baby getting personal or emotional but there are better ways to do it then than this alright let's move into the tracks that I thought were meh not terrible but not blowing me away either we have this new Eve tumor cut which I am NOT going to talk too much about a strawberry privilege is the name of the song not going to talk too much about it because I am going to be reviewing the new album very soon so I will get my thoughts on this track and others there but it is linked down below it'shat give it a listen anticipate it because I will be giving more thoughts on it soon new track from choice Vaughn which I thought was a very low impact blend of pop and R&B instrumental was cool but the vocals were super lacking wanted a lot more from them and yeah just generally underwhelmed just a tad moving on from their Thundercat we have a new song over here funny thing that I will also not get too deep into because I am going to really be reviewing this record very soon as well and don't want to spoil all of my thoughts on that but Thundercat review on the way soon soon soon this week around the corner we also have a new track from no age feeler which was kind of a slacker piece of punk rock that had it had a bit of sound play going on in it I mean nothing really beats the sound play on no ages nouns I mean the shoegaze II think a Z sounds on that record are so fantastic and not that I feel like the band needs to go back to exactly that in order to maintain my attention but the noisiness of the the abrasiveness of the euphoria of that record was so great and I feel like the further they've drifted from that or just you know sound play in general the the more lacking their their records have been feeler while not one of their worst singles still just felt a little mild and bland to me I feel like it just could have used a bit a bit more you know a bit more layers a bit more something some kind of you know aesthetic or just like textural hook to make things just sound a bit more interesting moving on from their new track from they the magnetic fields the production I did not care for on this one because it was just a really super tinny recording and not that magnetic fields are strangers to you know sort of alternative mixing or recording styles and anything but in this context I just didn't really care for it but but still I thought the song and the song concept itself craft work in a blackout was actually pretty clever and very entertaining leave it to the magnetic fields always have a something funny and witty to say moving on from there we have future with a new track tycoon I thought the court progression on this track was tried and true but still nice futures performance wasn't too bad either and his lyrics came through in a kind of cinematic way kind of a dark song for future I would say but still song not a strong hook and the track runs a little one-dimensional too not like some of the more interesting hook heavy as well as a multi-phase tracks off of the wizard but still not a not a terrible showing from future we have a new track from Edie O'Brien AOB you know of Radiohead Fame Olympic is the name of the track and while I I did think the vocals on this one were very lacking I do love how groovy linear and multi-phased the instrumental on this track is so you know if you guys are super into stuff like in rainbows era I think you'll fuck with this pretty heavy give it a try give it a shot we have to see slide you track from Drake gave a review of this one over on the Fantana channel I think there's some admirable qualities to this track some of the vocal lines of the lyrical concept as well as I guess the the sad dreary chord progression of the song too but it's very low on structure and Drake's performance is pretty unenthusiastic in fact I would say this is another example of Drake being lazy moving on from there we have a new track Jesus Christ 2005 god Bless America which I'm just noticing is is that like the font that that's like the YouTube video title font but anyway from the 1975 I didn't think this one was bad but I felt like the band's more recent singles have been kind of derivative including this one as this track just kind of sounds like some very hushed Sufjan Stevens indie folk you know it's again it's not terrible but it's not exactly a groundbreaking either and I feel like the band doesn't really put an interesting twist on this style they just kind of rip it off and that's that and let's move on to our the the tracks I thought were the best the ones that really kind of left an impression on me this week there are quite a few BAM one ooh ooh Bloomberg Fateh hope I'm pronouncing that correctly but anyway this is a new supergroup featuring a Jacob Bannon of converge flight of converged fame and there's connections to chopper cowboy twitching tongues so pretty heavy group you know look at looking at you know the personnel is it's gonna be a pretty pretty heavy group and sonically this track over here return to zero does share a lot in common with a like some old school very noisy converge but there are some chuggy ER heavier more metallic passages and elements to the track too so multiple phases to it and maybe a sound and some riffs that would appeal a bit more to metal fans you know with traditional metal fans and metalcore fans so you know you know give it a try give it a shot it's pretty heavy and very enjoyable very exciting looking forward to hearing more from this group we also have a new track from serpent with feet and a comma is the name of the song while it is not the most lavish track I've heard in my life and I thought some of the vocal lines were a pretty Radiohead ish which continues to be a pretty obvious influence for serpent with feet what I will say is I did love the tune quite a bit and I thought the the vocal performance was solid was quite nice and I liked the clarity of the whole thing as well so you know good track good track we have a song from an artist I'm just now hearing about this week nick Hakeem Kadir is the name of the song and this is actually a really cool piece of modern psychedelic soul and that's really all I can say about it you know good vocal performance great splashy washy production that's really colorful and a good song to boot liking it a lot liking it a lot I will be sort of trying to look out for anything else nick has coming out in the future after this but it's a really good track and ward whose new record I guess I should be kind of keeping an eye out for because I have been paying attention to most of the singles and this one over here is my favorite so far heavens nail and Hammer God do I love the vintage song you know sort of packed away in the background on this one the vocal harmonies are lovely it's dreamy its alluring it is gorgeous actually reminds me a lot of M words older stuff a very tasteful very vintage but done with uh you know modern Flair a modern flair to it and just good writing all around and quality production too so M word migration stories let's keep them moving we have a new track from Laura Marling over here which I thought was quite quite quite quite quite quite quite quite quite quite quite quite good held down is the title of the track and Laura Marling moves I would say in a bit of a full croc direction on this one punchy drums on this thing bolder vocals as well and I don't just a great all-around performance Laura Marling song and record can vary in intensity pretty widely although she doesn't really stand out tracks off her last LP but you know bangers in a way you could say but uh but still this is this is one of her most hard-hitting tracks in a while and her new record is coming out very soon and I got to say off of this song we'll be definitely scoping that out let's move on to the next one couple more left we have a new track from knowledge whose new record I have been sampling and so far I think it's okay but there is a wonderful standout cut it can be featuring Anderson pack which is a really cool low five fuzzy piece of hip-hop infused soul makes me wonder when we're gonna hear another collab from these two in the future just know that this track is great I think it's great Anderson kills the track and if you know if you're into a loaf I hip-hop and beat music and sampling check out this new knowledge record check it out and check out the song below it's linked down below we have a new track over here from a singer-songwriter who has been wowing me with her recent material Jess Williamson infinite scroll as low-key as her music is there is something truly alluring about it and the tunes are just solid as hell and they're dramatic too and just well produced I just love her sound that she's delivering with her recent tracks I'm really excited for this for this new record I truly truly truly am and we have a new track from Ice Age lockdown blues because a lot of people are locked down right now and it's a pretty raw badass rock cut that is slightly bluesy I suppose and I don't know just kind of in the vein and the spirit of much of what everybody is going through right now and I thought the band did a really good job of you know essentially attributing this moment of time that we are currently trapped in we have also a couple of tracks that have been sort of a surfaced on to the internet now from Frank Ocean dear April and Kai endo two tunes that I hope I don't know either make it onto the new record or we see new versions of on the new record either way these have been my two favorite songs of kind of his new musical cycle as of right now they're very low-key very baladi you know very much in the vein of a lot of the writing on blonde and endless instrumentals are very skeletal but still also loved a lot of the lyrics on dear April Tuesday is a Tuesday Drive so I thought was really cool yeah digging these tracks did a review of these songs over on the Fantino channel to check them out we have a new track from Empress of as well whose new album is out now love is a drug is the name of this track and it's really cool fusion of pop and dance music great vocals and kind of quirky instrumental - I'm gonna be giving this new album a a a shot a listen gonna be keeping my ear to the ground on this one as well because some of the material so far has been uh catching my attention and also Andrew bird shout-out to him who has this track capital crime that he has dropped out of the blue I suppose it's not the most apt time to share this track but still apparently it's a song where Andrew is focusing on and reflecting on capital punishment he has some pretty strong opinions on that and it's actually a really great track compelling vocal performance totally dramatic and sharp instrumental on it - not as bland and as very middle-of-the-road as a lot of the stuff off of his last record yeah you know I'm really digging this one and you know good on Andrew for taking a stand on this pretty significant issue you know pretty significant issue we're a lot of innocent lives end up getting you know just slip through the cracks because our justice system is not super dependable a lot of the time you know look into it google it there's a lot of shocking information about the about a capital punishment that you may find and I think I'm going to leave it at that that has been the weekly track round up everybody weekly track roundup all right all the songs again linked down below that I talked about and our turntable a blank our patreon link and just make sure that out there you are taking care of yourselves taking care of each other staying safe staying healthy staying kovin free and hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this video I will see you in the next review you have any Fantana weekly track roundup 
W2xOmf1sPXE,ah this new jointer Lucas record it's not good Joyner Lucas is a massachusetts lyricist mc1 who i have been keeping tabs on and off of for a while now really since he's been making noise off of his 508 507 22:09 mixtape back in 2017 around that he began dropping a lot of tracks singles remixes of more popular songs and artists where he would show that he's a bit of a lyrical miracle he's got some bars he's got some wordplay is kind of clever a bit of an aggressive and fast flow even though rappers that tend to run in that direction grow very tiresome for me as of late I was thinking that maybe this guy has some potential maybe there is something coming from him down the pipe that is gonna be worthwhile maybe he's just taking his time to evolve and develop into something a bit more thought-provoking possibly for example that super viral I'm not racist track he dropped in 2017 while that did not land message wise with everybody I didn't think it was a pretty bold and at least an admirable attempt at creating a conversation around the current day racial divides in America I guess part of me thought that Joyner was artistically still a work in progress even though now that I look back he's been dropping stuff since 2011 I suppose I just wasn't that acclimated to joiners work yet and maybe if I had been with his earlier mixtapes like Along Came Joyner or even backwards and maybe I would have realized that he doesn't really have that much working beyond the surface for him I did begin to get that sense as I heard single after single after single actually like nine singles from this record so many I didn't even hear them all for the release of this album but still dude dropped nine singles from his record before the album was actually out and a good chunk of the record beyond that is skits so a majority of this album essentially fans are already hearing before it's out so this thing did eventually drop I was just so not excited for it at all and now that I hear it all together in one bunch it's it's like even worse than I originally thought to the point where the single ice is featuring logic which originally I thought was just so so kind of underwhelming is actually fireworks and one of the best songs here really an oasis in the tracklist in joiners defense the record doesn't kick off too badly if you completely ignore the cringy skit where you have a kid interacting with a doctor showing him like a Rorschach test and as the kid begins to see disturbing things in the images the doctors like what are you fuckin retard you're fuckin stupid which like is isn't this album about your mental health your ADHD what what does this have to do with you having ADHD having an abusive therapist who later on the album offers him cocaine for some weird reason I mean maybe that's something that to joyner happened I don't know but all I know is again it doesn't really play into the theme of the title of the album still following this intro skit we have an intro song yes I lied where Joyner wastes tons of space saying I let the money change me I lied he's essentially going over all the ways things have been altered in his life since blowing up musically speaking and while I do like his aggressive delivery and energy level on this track something about him trying to play the sinister sort of demented I'm crazy card isn't really landing for me but honestly what I wish I was actually listening to a some flawed concept record about joiners emotional or mental pain anguish something instead what we get past this point is a series of incredibly derivative ripoffs where Joyner doesn't really bring much to the table not any strong hooks not any great vocal performances weak production very little originality or personality to I don't know what it is about his vocals on the war that causes him to change over a buttery more I guess low-key sensual instrumental but Joyner on this track featuring young thug who really does underplay his feature here sounds exactly like a poor man's ty dolla sign he just sounds like ty dolla sign but worse and what's funny is this is not even the only point on the record where he sounds like ty we then get a very annoying skit from Chris Tucker surprisingly on here though to his credit he does sound more genuine in his recording than a Kevin Hart does later on the record both of whom are essentially just like getting it Joyner for not being dependable or just not getting his album out but what's worse than really both of these tracks is the song I love which has a garbage hook I love you you wrote this this is a thing that you wrote painfully boring painfully basic like just a bland B joiners bars are barely even worth listening to there's massive amounts of space in between each bar he's not even really giving a good performance either it's just so middle-of-the-road while simultaneously trying to sound deep and dramatic which it fails at horrendously the following track devils work is another blatant ripoff he sounds like Meek Mill on this song from the flow to the inflection even down to the production choice with the dramatic guitars and the background it just kind of sounds like one of those introspective meek tracks although Joyner gives us some supremely whack bars like I need you to give us back Martin Luther take Martin shkreli give us back Malcolm take our Kelly though later in the track he's talking about how we need MJ back I'm wondering if this was recorded pre leaving Neverland and if it wasn't is he just like playing accusation ala carte but regardless of how terrible the bars are it's just so distracting how much it sounds like meek what wasn't this guy bitching about how logic was copying him like years ago and and now he just can't stop copying everyone else the song lotto isn't one of the most derivative songs on here but it is one of the most confusing as what is he getting at on this track what is he rapping about is he rapping about having money or what he would do if he had more money taking kids lining them up and getting them all sober is he just like wanting or wishing he could force people into rehab also the counting in Spanish refrain combined with all the silly ass ad-libs all over this track just make it annoying as hell there's just so much space on this track and so many others that Joyner wastes on like bad hooks bad repetitions shouting or boo boo boo boo in the background of the song that doesn't really add anything to the track which is something generally I'm not all that much against if you can actually do it or execute it in a way where it like really brings an energy to the song but in joiners case it just sounds really goofy the song gold mine to my ears was another ty dolla sign ripoff although there was a bar that stuck out to me on this track go against the grain then you got to be brave she don't like me then she got to be gay we're still doing this we're still doing bars like this in 2020 I mean look if not liking Joyner Lucas makes you gay call me gay not even clever funny and just embarrassing at this point and honestly this isn't even the only point on the record where Joyner drops a bar that shows that his gender where sexual politics are kind of fucked we then get the track finally featuring Chris Brown that not only has a hook that interpolates Cece Peniston 'aa finally which is an amazing song but the way they work it into this track is horrible and essentially ruins it what's even more distracting than that though on the track is just how much Joyner sounds like Drake on this song like his bars and his flows are just loaded with so many Drake isms and Drake type inflections again why is the record so friggin derivative ten bands has a shockingly bad Timbaland beat I mean some of the synths are kind of cool but the the the groove of the track is pretty weak and I think the high hats are mixed way too goddamn high to the point where they actually kind of take up space where I think joiners voice should be one more thing I want to point out about this track though and many others on this record is that it's boring to listen to because Joyner will go bar after bar after bar after bar of having not said anything witty smart no double entendre 'he's nothing really in the way of a pen you don't really know what you up against boy you know I always had the upper hand you ain't never been through the struggle man homemade grits in the oven pan you don't run shit you don't want to dance two shots make him do the running man and they say love is a drug man I swear I'll never take drugs again I traded my bike for a hoop Dean traded my hoop D for a Honda traded my Honda for a panther I just got a crib in Wakanda I never been into the drama never been a fan of designer and all I really got is one wish a one-night stand with Madonna the closest thing to a word twist there was when he said he traded his Honda for a panther and then he related that to the Wakanda thing the Black Panther that really that was that was it and this isn't even a unique situation on this record where again he'll just go on and on and on and on and on and like the the the rhymes the meaning the substance like there's no depth there's no other layer it's really odd that joiner prides himself on rapping so clearly and so quickly on some tracks too when it's really apparent that he just has so little to say the intro portion of the song revenge I feel like is what happens when you listen to xxx tent asean once as joyner is trying to do a bit of an emo rap thing here I mean his flow does smooth out and get a bit harder as the beat kicks in but by then the song and this album in general are just too boring for words anyway following that the title track of the record is is really like the cringy emo rap anthem of the record with Joyner like whiny Lee is singing his heart out on a very terrible hook laughably bad like it's a track that that you would do if you were trying to I guess parity juice world or something things get even worse on the track still can't love which features easily one of the worst instrumentals on the entire record also very obnoxious King osf vocal lines Fabolous is in the mix there too but I mean his presence on the track doesn't really save it I guess I can kind of give points to the track will for attempting to be a thoughtful banger about idolizing people looking up to your heroes having good role models in your life I guess but still the Will Smith references are really heavy-handed the closing track at least has a decent beat with some chopped-up soul ala Kanye Madlen maybe even a bit of MF DOOM with a lo-fi twist but there's a series of confusing bars on this track to where Joyner is talking about how you'd at any point can call up J get a hold of puff tell Drake to send the jet out for what reason I don't know does Drake want to hear you copy him do your best Drake impression I don't get it when everything's said and done I'm left here wondering does Joyner Lucas have an original idea in his head because if he does none of that really came out in this record I don't know why he seems to have had some pretty interesting conceptual tracks in the past maybe not perfect maybe not the best you've ever heard but certainly interesting chock full of potential I can't really say heard anything on this record that had any potential to my ears and I don't know why Joyner is sounding more derivative than he ever has before on a majority of these tracks so if we're going to have a Joyner record in the future that's actually good we need more originality we need better production we need better hooks we need pen game please for the love of God write something that actually makes me want to rewind the track and re listen to what you said because there's so many layers to it instead of just dropping a corny fucking movie reference after 10 bars of almost nothing yeah this Joyner Lucas record it's not good [Music] 
p_Db3vDJuWU,hi everyone brain Danny waved Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Nicholas jar record Sinise's this is the latest full-length LP from one of the most acclaimed electronic musicians of the past decade Nicholas jar it's hard to believe I've been listening to the man's music for almost 10 years now and records such as spaces only noise as well as Darkseid psychic still sound refreshing to this day Nick's trajectory artistically over this span of time has been a strange one though and it's only getting stranger from his soundtrack to an old Soviet art film to the ambient pop stylings of sirens and then on to the deep and somewhat outsider house of against all logic the second project under the pseudonym Nicolas just dropped this year which makes this the second album Nick has released this year and on this record we're met with another massive change of pace as this album is mostly a series of semi ambient electro acoustic pieces that are very abstract and far outside of the house stylings that Nick has built his name on there are 13 pieces on this record and they all cover a pretty wide range of instrumental palettes from the watery Keys and shuffling percussive noise and wailing reed leads on the track rubble to the track Xerox which is a stunning drone piece loaded with a lot of raw pitchy instrumentation that is shrouded in ambient noise there might be some hammered dulcimer worked into there too either way the entire piece devolves into this glitchy and surreal series of edits that are actually one of the few stylistic through threads on many of these tracks as sonically and aesthetically there's not a whole ton weaving all of these tracks together somehow despite being a disconnected series of musical vignettes the pomegranates record sounded more cohesive than this while I do realize the entire record here is relatively left-field and a bit heady still the track mud which is a very tribal and somewhat psychedelic journey of sorts doesn't really compare to anything else on the album so while Sinise's isn't exactly the most cohesive record in this somewhat ambient style that you're ever going to hear most of the pieces are still pretty evocative we have the opening track vanish which features some ambient synthesizers matched with chilling vocal harmonies the whole thing sounds like the start to a horrible nightmare where I see myself die with a side of sleep paralysis then the following track switches things up hitting me with some ambien almost barely there bass along with some ghostly distantly vocals then a lot of weird glitchy metallic percussive noise almost keeping the pace of the track the entire thing feels like a dreamy extension of the intro but with a slightly industrially tinged vibe meanwhile the title track comes through sounding a bit fuzzier a bit more low fidelity honestly it all sounds like a little bit of AI a err a grouper but with mix voice on top of it instead which is relatively haunting especially as he digs into his lower register and sings very close to the microphone it's like a poltergeist is in my ear reciting some odd incantation and though it's a big instrumental change I think the records surreal and somewhat fear inducing vibe continues on to the song augusto where Nicholas gives us some howling Reed's set against some wringing dreary pianos that all eventually fracture into these glitchy synthesizer runs it's an odd transition but somehow it works but from here I think Nick does start to lose what little cohesion the album has going for it so far especially with the track go che where it sounds like we get more hammered dulcimer along with this very sharp end woody type of rolling percussion despite the instrumentation on this track sounding so organic it all comes off very alien and otherworldly the piece is pretty meditative and has a cool start but I didn't think there was much in the way of an interesting progression on this track with the percussion becoming more and more grating and those plucky runs of tones just become so aggressive and just very messy and I guess obnoxious meanwhile the track mud I alluded to earlier is like a trippy neo psyche powwow with some primal drums and drones on top of that nicolas is very fuzzy voice soaked in delay and the whole performance sounds like he is just stuck in some sort of trance especially as he begins to shout instrumentation gets thicker and while the progression is pretty slow I do like the end point which is a pretty nice payoff is as everything gets a bit jammy ER feels like it's a lot more in the moment every piece of instrumentation just embellishing a little bit here and there digging more into the groove the drumming at the end of this track follows right into the next one in a bit of a segue but on top of the drone now we get these wheezy harmonies of what sounds like either horn or strings it's difficult to tell as it's so warped and melty sounds like the kind of mood piece you would produce if you took all of your instrumentation and recording equipment to a silent monk commune and just isolated yourself there for a year the song Thunder which didn't really impress me all that much originally as a single does make a lot more sense within the context of this tracklist the cycling organ sense on the track worked very nicely against Nick's very low-key voice and lost transmission sound effects that really light up certain moments of the track it's a cool progression very low-key very subtle and I love how the sense lightly contort as the song moves along just jumping up and down and a somewhat spastic but quiet way here and there my number one issue with the track now is that it ends a little abruptly and it is one of the few tracks here that I do wish extended a bit further the track hello chain brings another change of pace with a weirdly angelic vocal harmony intro which ends and then brings us another series of Oklahoma knees that sounds like a different progression different singers different recording either way this new section is what the bulk of the song indulges in and the this series of harmonies sounds a bit more operatic I guess the mix of vocals is coloured occasionally with these bright harmonic shots of tones and since it's pretty bold the ending of the album is not all that bad ruble and Xerox tracks that I mentioned earlier are easily two of the better pieces here even if those wailing reads solos on the former come on pretty strong then there's garden that kicks off with these cycling meditative piano phrases that make me feel like I'm locked into the intro of a James Blake song that never quite ends or resolves as the progression of this track is pretty much non-existent and faith made of silk the closing track is maybe the most lively piece of music on the entire record as it features a very booming bit of percussion that is pretty groovy strong pulse to it decidedly Latin to NIC colors this with some ringing synthesizers comatose vocals and in a way it sounds like a bit of an offshoot of something off of Radiohead's King of Limbs in a good way although the piece is very depressive an ascending chord progression read to me is a bit more Kid A or even amnesiac still it's really the drums on this track that steal the show is they get more intense as they move along and hit a bit of a fever pitch at the very end where they cut off abruptly and we are met with quite a bit of silence toward the tail of the track which I suppose just gives me some much-needed space to reflect on everything I just heard because this was a pretty perplexing semi ambient record and still while I do wish some tracks extended and maybe that there was a narrower focus instrumentally I still had a lot of fun with it I loved it actually I thought it was wonderfully reflective as well as a mind-bending some might call this album kind of trippy as well although for me personally I thought it was kind of sober in tone in that you are just isolating yourself in your mind facing down your dark side facing down your demons and just essentially exercising musically and artistically whatever comes as a result of that feeling a light eight on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you

1-YccbQ9EVk,hi everyone laughing screaming Tanner here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Don Tolliver Project heaven or hell this is a new full-length album from Houston artist Don Tolliver who had a pretty big showing through his multiple impressive features and appearances on Travis Scott's recent Jack boys compilation out of all of the artists Travis has been working with through his Cactus Jack record label as of late that he was trying to showcase on that project Tolliver was easily the standout for me as he came through singing with a pretty bold dynamic nasally voice that empowered nearly every one of the compilations hooks so as a result of that I was instantly curious as to what Tolliver would sound like on a new full-length album lo and behold here it is 12 tracks spread out amongst 36 minutes and I got to say I'm not that impressed in a way I guess you could say based off of his appearances on the Jack boys compilation his astral world feature - Tolliver didn't meet expectations his voice is still sounding pretty good it has a strange Tambor to it it's bold as slices through all of this trippy trap production but that's how much we knew about Don Tolliver before we heard this album heaven or hell really fails to illustrate anything that you couldn't have already gleaned about Tolliver from a feature we have a super comatose opener that truly fails as a tone setter unless what Tolliver wants to tell us is this record is going to put us to sleep following that is the track euphoria where Tolliver sounds like a back-end feature on a Travis Scott song the record doesn't sound terrible but it's already kind of failing the first impression test in terms of I am Don Tolliver this is my sound this is my direction this is my really anything how is what we're hearing so far defining you as a solo artist because all of this just pretty much sounds like it's in the shadow of Travis Scott sound Travis Scott's everything and just as Travis Scott couldn't be where he is today if he just played the role of a kanye protege forever there is no way you were going to move beyond where you are right now if you're just riding the coattails of Travis Scott Sound which this album pretty much does the track company with its booming beats and somewhat luxurious synth layers sounds like a watered down version of something off of rodeo I get a similar vibe off of the track had enough even though that's easily one of these sharper cuts here for sure this project has highlights and bright spots that I don't want to deny the existence of we have some super solid vocal lines and refrains on the tracks waisted and cardigan even though both songs don't really amount to much more than just a very chill somewhat druggie vibe the song after-party in my opinion is more the total package infectious course as well as slightly more eccentric production with some horn breaks as well as plucky synth passages throughout the verses very expressive singing throughout the entire track - it's not like the song goes to sleep as soon as the chorus is over it is a smokey euphoric nocturnal banger the track can't feel my legs was a standout for me - Tolliver takes a slightly more narrative approach with the lyrics even though the point of the song doesn't amount to much more than just being drunk and high out of your mind the track is filled with these super pillowy blossoms of synthesizers as well as these ascending vocal lines also love that refrain on the hook I can't because I can't feel my leg you know it doesn't entirely pan out but still kudos to the tracks spaceship featuring sheykh Wes easily the weirdest track on here even though Tolliver's flow and lyrics on this track are totally boring I do like the strange vocal harmony is the minimal beat as well as the alien synths and very shouty sheykh feature all of that adds up into a lovably awkward experience that I can't totally turn my ears away from as long as I'm complaining though the least favorite of mine on the record has to go to candy which not only is tedious just soaked in way too much reverb but is loaded with some of the worst vocal lines and refrains on the entire record to candy-coat and be so sweet but truly and honestly what makes this track hard to swallow is Tolliver's trying to go into more of a I guess a loving somewhat sentimental and sensual direction on this track and I'm not sure if he's really nailed that delivery on this cut even though he finds himself singing on pretty much every track here I guess singing in this tone and with this delivery and trying to instill this specific feeling within listeners not quite working out the final moments of the record in my opinion leave a lot to be desired to the track no photos aesthetically topically and instrumentally just seems totally pointless as it just seems like a variation of many of the ideas we've been hearing up until this point it's sort of unfortunate that in this very short span of time for this record Toliver has really run short on ideas the track no idea was soaked in a bit too much reverb too to the point where it's really drowning in it taking any teeth potentially away from the track one thing that was a surprise on this track that was Tolliver's falsetto which was incredibly weird kind of funny but at least injected something interesting into the song yeah I mean a lot of my issues with this LP overall come down to what I initially said about this record before getting into a lot of the tracks just that there's not a whole lot here that is revealed by listening to Tolliver in an album context there doesn't really seem to be much in terms of a theme or a flow too many of these tracks too I mean it's it's funny that this thing was named heaven or hell because there's not a whole lot of duality to this record and in fact there's not a lot of dimensions at all outside of one really so I guess in terms of future projects from Tolliver I'm hoping for bolder production choices better writing and lyrics across the board songs that feel like they have a bit more structure to them because outside of a handful of tracks and Tolliver's somewhat stunning voice a lot of what's here is pretty painfully average feeling a decent two strong five on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Don Tolliver heaven or hell forever 
aHVTlcNdIFc,hi everyone Tom the Denis 8 an imperial Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Sufjan Stevens and Lowell Brahms album aporia this is a new musical collaboration featuring indie phenom singing songwriting legend mr. Sufjan Stevens and Lowell Brahms if that name is familiar that's because Lowell is the Lowell from Sufjan Stevens 2015 critically acclaimed album carrion Lowell Brahms is obviously not just Sufjan stepfather he is a musician himself as well though that should be no surprise as he co-founded asthmatic Kitty records with soufiane and dropped a record on that label in 2009 it featured contributions from soufiane as well so in concept these two crossing over musically is nothing new however here on this record they're doing it in a big way with a full list of 21 tracks all of which flirt with ambient music and new age and progressive electronics now I admit going into this record I did not have the highest expectations mostly because some of the teaser material I heard I didn't think it was all that impressive but I did get the impression this was going to be a pretty experimental and cerebral listen whose appeal couldn't merely be boiled down to a 2 or 3-minute song so I just avoided any and all other previews of this thing in hopes that a holistic listen would lead to more enjoyment but I'm sad to report that this project didn't come together in a holistic fashion whatsoever the tracklist on this thing is basically one half-hearted synth and electronic piece after another very few of which actually develop into anything memorable and what's worse about this record is just how derivative all of it is rarely does a moment go by where I'm not thinking of how another artist could do this but better like the eerie drones and fuzzy tones toward the end of mythology that are pretty apocalyptic and to me sound like some somewhat watered-down Tim Hecker which wouldn't be too bad if it actually had some structure to it or I don't know opened up before just cutting off abruptly around one minute and 45 seconds and on afterworld Alliance we get a lot of very digital moody synth layers set to semi-industrial rhythms that are very patient somewhat relaxing and I'm kind of reminded of Trent Reznor's work in addition to this there are multiple tracks on this thing that just sound like bad film music like on what it takes which has these a pretty hopeful strings and vocals combined with these tribal beats it sounds like the preparation montage before a Disney Princess goes and fights a battle with a villain with her animal sidekick meanwhile Agathon sounds like what you would get with the terminator soundtrack with 1/8 of the budget on backhanded cloud we have these dissonant layers of what sound like strings from a psychological thriller but then the track boughs out really quickly after some very obtuse synth arpeggios start blaring and covering everything else in the mix it reminds me of something a group like tangerine dream would have to do back in the day if like some of the equipment like shit the bed and then they needed something else to just kind of like end a song off except in this case that happened because I don't know the piece had nowhere to go next after like a few moments of existence look there are tracks on this thing that while they are on they do border on beautiful or add up to maybe some faithful Eno worship or a little Vangelis worship to but more often than not what I'm being handed in this tracklist are these very short winded unimpressive experiments for Raymond Scott for example which is so preposterous I I wonder how mr. Scott would feel about this track it almost sounds like a diss or I'm hearing what sounds like an audition for the soundtrack to the new Neal Breen film where he impregnates a cyborg alien with his five laptops spilling coffee everywhere in the process with weak compositions scant progressions and a total lack of originality the only thing that could possibly save this album is if the sound design were like over-the-top amazing but even that most of the time is so-so even though it's maybe one of the better things the record has going for it the textures Tambor's and sound play on the cell our standard at best or unintentionally grading at worst like on the track the runaround that features this really pitchy synthesizer wailing all over the mix in a horrid way the more I listen to it the more I feel like I'm getting tinnitus and what's funny is the teaser material from this album that ends up mostly toward the end of it actually ended up being the best tracks the entire record when compared to the rest of the album so there still some of the most artistically coherent pieces here despite still not being much to write home about I will say I did kind of love the quirky semi-industrial underwater synth Odyssey presented on the track captain praxis that to me reminded me of what would happen if you've had trent reznor sound tracking the life aquatic and I did like the booming and vast synth piece eudaimonia which reminded me of what you may get if you took a bunch of instrumental bits from a new wave song and tried to force that into an ambient track the closer on this thing was pretty thankless as well in my opinion I'm just not really enjoying this at all this is about as disheveled unfocused and pointless as an album in this style can be there are some fleeting moments of intrigue and beauty here and there in the tracklist but don't expect any of it to last for very long I'm feeling a light too decent three on this thing transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my head is another review that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Sufjan Stevens Lowell Brahms forever 
92vrirjwNgU,
NfGPMT6RNJU,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new horse Lords album the common task this is a new full-length LP from Baltimore based quartet horse Lords this thing is out now via northern spy records and for a decade now horse Lords have been purveyors of an interesting blend of jazz rock experimental rock krautrock and math rock the band clearly takes notes from the repetition and layering of minimalist music too however it hasn't been until recently that the band's actually grabbed my attention and they've done it with this LP the common task which feels less like a standard popular music album and more like a five phase sonic experience linear ever-evolving grooves executed with fluid performances a relatively crisp mix with a lot of separation between each piece of instrumentation which you want because nearly all of the tracks here evolved into this polyrhythmic menagerie of sound on the opening track fanfare for effective freedom we have these thumping drums that are syncopating and slowly gaining momentum with these guitars whose phrases are very much skipping along the groove of the track and sometimes feel really geometric in how angular and jerky they are and for a good portion of this song the band finds a variety of ways to treat and progress this groove in such a way where it is always changing but always feels the same until there's a breaking point at about 340 where the band busts into these grooves and riffs that feel like a take off of some vintage psych Rock add in these totally surreal I don't know how they're doing it very twangy swirls of guitar arpeggios that cycle as if a machine is playing them there's also some chords squawking away in the right channel block percussion creating so much noise and so much density all the way in the back this thing really changes into a sonic madhouse just before it devolves into these drums syncing up with the guitars again that are just like muted strumming so you're kind of getting that crunchy to store I know the way I'm describing this probably sounds nutty but it is a strange progression and this is often how this type of music runs anyway it's a lot of grooving it's a lot of jamming it's a lot of linear progressions it really hypnotizes you it locks you into one sense of momentum and you're kind of moving through everything the band is presenting to you without any big changes into a verse a chorus a bridge or anything like that it's just this one idea always changing always shifting and before you know it by the time you're at the end of the song where you are is entirely different than where you started but still as noisy and as rudimentary as this last passage is it's still oddly gratifying I would say the psychedelic nods are even stronger on the following track where you have roughly the same instrumental palette but now with some droning saxophones at the start that are a little woozy these saxs and guitars build up to a point just before the halfway mark of the song where everything is just wailing and layering in a way that's sort of really tense yeah the performance on this track and really everywhere on this album is it's so tight the progressions and pacing of these songs are really a rollercoaster of sorts and it's that tightness in the performance that just straps you into it for the entire ride so after these two monstrous and very thick cuts the band decides to treat listeners to a different take on a bagpipe drone occasionally the sounds worked into this track do get a little grating but one thing I like about the band on this one and on nearly every track here is that they flirt with the idea of getting a little abrasive but they never overstep that line to where it's too abrasive just enough to give these tracks more teeth more tension and this cut slips right into people's Park and it's actually the first phase on this record I would dare say is somewhat pretty some of the more mystical bits of guitar combined with the bubbly cyntha arpeggios are quite cute while I thought this track wasn't too bad as a teaser as a single for the album hearing it in context with the other songs here I do wish it were longer I do wish it had a bit more progression to offer like every other moment on this record with it being structurally as as simple as it is it does make it stand out in a strange way still it's a pretty quaint Jam and I do love the way it devolves into what sounds like this drum circle from the other side of the galaxy at the very end with all these drum hits layering on top of each other in a very alien way and to top things off on this album we have the 18 minute closer integral accident 18 minutes which is pretty long yes but I guess if you're this far into the album you are in it for the long haul anyway so why not kick things off with what sounds like a field recording of people shuffling around in a large marble room why not ambient drones and gentle vocals calling out behind them why not weave in some violin and begin building things up with some rudimentary guitars and drums I am with you a saxophone then starts bouncing off everything they're doing we get some bass and now we're grooving and not just grooving because all the previous musical elements that were there are still hanging here and turning up the vocals the violins the drones these Stern musical phrases at this point the song feels less like a jam and more like the soundtrack to some sort of occult ritual with the last third of the song transitioning from what sounded like sacrifice - now we're smearing the blood on ourselves and dancing around the flames of our you know Pig God then all of a sudden the entire mix is totally overtaken by these revving up ascending synthesizers which if we're sticking with the narrative I've given so far could be representative of aliens just pulling all the cultists into a tractor beam whatever your interpretation of this very lengthy piece is and I implore you to come up with one because it is long it's certainly evocative that's the record five tracks 40 minutes and change it's not too bad a fun listen for something that is so weird and experimental and keep in mind I mean this thing is not the most out there record on the block it's a maybe only going to be strange to those who have not heard too much in the way of krautrock or jazz rock but still it's it's pretty accessible to sure their points that maybe I wish were a bit longer or had more layers or had a grander instrumental presentation I think the flow of the record is a bit peculiar too with these very similar two tracks starting the whole thing off ambient transition people's Park that I think could have been longer and then that massive ending cut in its very lopsided there's also the mix which again I did say was pretty clear and does present the instrumentation very nicely you can hear everything and what it is doing with quite a bit of clarity but still I do wish it was a bit more vibrant and in wet sometimes it is a little dry still all those critiques are relatively minor at least in my view and stand in the shadow of just how great the performances and how dizzying and engaging all of the progressions and compositions here are even though this record isn't the greatest thing I've ever heard in these styles and there are some points where I'm reminded of other contemporaries of theirs that run a similar blend of genres like Azis the common task is a great LP that I had a great time with I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what

U8DL0wDfxAw,hi everyone in Denis I attend here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new garden album choose mozu bullring the garden is a musical duo of California rock absurdists who broke pretty hard in 2013 off of making a big boy transition getting their sophomore record on to epitaph haha was the title of that LP which I still to this day continued to be somewhat torn on I loved the eccentricity I love the weird attitude and lyrics the experimental and noisy clashes of art rock and punk and electronic music and hip hop and everything in between also there were tracks on this thing that I found to be pretty annoying at times it felt like the songwriting was even taking a backseat to how weird can we make this sound or how obnoxious can this possibly be but still having said that I guess I respect what the garden does a lot more than your average Beach rock band or Mack DeMarco ripoff they are sounding pretty daring even if a lot of the time I feel like it's not for me personally so they followed this record up a few years later with mirror might steal your charm an album that for the most part felt like yet another helping of all the ideas and concepts that made haha so difficult to like but now it's a new decade I'm hoping that this new garden album charms me hoping the duo can really click with me this time especially since kiss my Super Bowl ring is shaping up to be their most well received record yet and for sure I do hear some slight improvements on this thing on the production end also some of the songs here seem relatively focused and I like how DIY every corner of this LP comes off in a way I think the sound of this record is perfectly embodied by the cover art it is attached to we had this cartoony logo right up front that not only features spider webs on it but it looks like like a parody of a graffiti tag in the back and image of absolutely filthy a disgusting pile of empty bottles just staring at this image I get this potent very pungent smell of flat corn syrup and warm beer in my nose and it makes me want to throw up and then the smack dab in the middle we have what would be the crown jewel of any LARPers or cosplayers weaponry collection very out of place not sure why it's there but it's it is a statement like with the gardens past efforts the music here features garish juxtapositions of aesthetic and style but now they're working off a slightly different list of influences and sounds like trap and alternative rock grindcore and noise rock rap rock even if you tracks the seem like over nods to the prodigy like the track hit eject which again the distorted bustling beats as well as the somewhat rapped vocals on this song prodigy all the way but the tone and almost the the the humour of the lyrics and in the satire coming out of them - it's almost Zappa s Caswell so of course all these ideas and sounds are presented throughout this record with maximum separation and contrast as the garden shifts gears changes sounds they really really really want you to feel it every time like on the opener clench to stay awake the only thing I can truly say about this is that I am in awe at just how little these guys give a shit they really could not care less between the temper tantrum style screams they put over a few points here along with the weird Assembly of aggressive leap and synthetic pieces of percussion place almost randomly in some parts it's a very novel combo however I still can't help but feel like the dejected alt-rock passages that kick the song off are kind of boring also the zany throaty kind of pop punk vocal affectation that's used in the middle of the song is just too annoying for words it was an issue that I had on previous records as well with the following a struggle I have to admit grinding spazzy noise rock passages contrasting with dreary folk bits that sound like something out of a grizzly bear song is not something I would have thought of coming together in my wildest dreams I also didn't think the track would into a dreamy synthetic piece of pop punk either but here we are and it's actually sounding pretty good on this track and even the open or - it does sound like there is a bit more method to the garden's madness this time around especially with the title track on the album which is one of the more low-key moments here and doesn't seem as concerned with trying to impress the listener with any weird sudden changes in any direction we get a lot of sad guitars a lot of tense speedy beats and a pretty focused song topic essentially conveying to the listener this message of if you're this if you're that if you're another thing kiss my Super Bowl ring which my read of is pretty simple it just seems like an elaborate way to say fuck off or know your place which given the gardens general attitude is a sentiment that many songs on this album can be boiled down to I mean the closing track on here is literally titled please fuck off and surprisingly there are more moments following this one that feature not just coherent songs but song topics like am/pm truck which sounds like a really noisy and irreverent piece of ska punk but it's actually a song of regret when you dig deeper into the lyrics which seem to tell a tale of just a brush with death and one more highlight on the album for me was the track king of cutting corners which is a hilarious and noisy punk song that is what the title says it is it's just a funny character portrait of someone who takes pride in their ability to cut corners get things done earlier however I didn't really expect any consistency going into this record and neither should you because the garden is still relatively obsessed with this idea of just presenting so much contrast so much change across the record that there is little attention paid to the macro picture of the entire album outside of everything just always shifting in a different direction every few moments or so however that doesn't ruin my enjoyment of the album as much as just the songs that are the most obnoxious like the tracks sneaky little devil which features some brash semi cringy rap verses set to break beats somewhat distorted mix very freakish screams at a few points - I can't wait for it to be over actually near every rap verse on this project is like a low point on it the initial moments of fools expedition despite the last leg of the song being so good or the track lurkin as well now mind you I do love the song's message of not wanting to be some asshole that is desperate to climb up a shitty social ladder but the beat and the raps on this song sound like Mindless Self Indulgence but worse and without the excuse of hey you know what it was mm I have a harder time being complementary toward the track lowrider slug even though it features Arial pink which by the way is a crossover that totally makes sense but many portions of this song are just like a stale piece of alt rock with super spazzy transitions of vocals and bass and drums that I don't know don't seem like that big of a payoff especially since they're equally noisy bits earlier on the record serving pretty much the same purpose Ariel's appearance on the track leaves a lot to be desired too so overall even though I'm not crazy about this record I still to this day cannot call myself a garden fan I will say this is the closest I've come to actually loving one of their records still I found many parts of this record to be underwritten and irritating but I suppose the more creative song topics and coherent song structures as well as interesting clashes of genres and ideas did take the edge off of that a little bit so while I sort of get the hype behind the garden at this moment I'm still not entirely convinced that the duo isn't just taking the piss 99% of the time or that they're just not I don't know with their music creating some elaborate joke that I'm not entirely in on but having said that I do respect the very left field and just fuck anyone who doesn't like it attitude the duo brings to the table feeling a light to decent six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the Bell is well over here next to my another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana the garden kiss my Super Bowl ring forever

GpyoyfxLmCU,whoo hi everyone snow thneed a tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new weekend album after hours this is a new LP from singer songwriter producer as well as he has done quite a bit of the production on this new album here able Tesfaye a.k.a the weekend for the past decade abel has not just been the most key voice to come out of R&B from canada but may be the most key voice to come out of R&B period while i wouldn't say he was the first voice to embark upon what many have dubbed alternative R&B he did uh sure it into the mainstream in a pretty big way with his druggy depressive brand of exploitative party anthems but abel went essentially from a critically acclaimed and tragic trilogy of mixtapes to a series of hit or miss studio albums all of which so far have contained at least a great handful of highlights while I'm not crazy about star boy or Beauty behind the madness from front to back both of those records do contain some of the best pop in R&B singles of the 2010s but it would seem Abel is no longer content operating at that level because on his new effort here he is reinventing himself resurfacing with a new hairstyle an edgy vintage look so with that I was wondering maybe able sound will be overhauled on this record as well something that embodies his new persona and direction but it was nearly impossible to forecast this record sound based off of the singles there's heartless which is a great track but it sounds like your typical weekend affair but it's boiled down to a very simple pop structure with a chorus so strong it's on roids blinding lights though is a total change of course a surprise 80s throwback of which there are quite a few on this thing but it as well has a strong tune and features one of Abel's most charismatic vocal performances ever I say then there's a lot of dance pop nods and a tension building intro on the title track and expansive structure and some extra mile sound design as well so based on these tracks all of which are good what are we getting on this record is it an 80s thing is it your usual weekend thing is it like an art pop exploratory multi-phased R&B epic progressive thing the production list is kind of a head-scratcher to as yes Abel does take part in the instrumentals here quite a bit but also Max Martin is on here OneNote Rick's point never Metro boomin ill Angelo and while stylistically all these decisions lead to one of Abel's most all-over-the-place track lists I still think after hours is Abel's most enjoyable commercial record yet it does come with a rough start though the first track alone again it does come with some cool synth passages but the mix leaves a lot to be desired mostly because Abel is so buried so distant his voice is so heavily processed - there's different portions of the instrumental - that don't really segue all that creatively the trap beat that eventually dropped is a really plain but part of me thought okay maybe all this junk is going on because it's an intro track it's a taster it's trying to be dramatic maybe it's just playing a little hard to get but no the next track too late suffers from a lot of the same problems - the vocals again are so touched up and so manipulated they barely sound like Abel he sounds like not the weekend he sounds like the weekday and now it's happening over this two-step beat that sounds like a leftover from the last disclosure LP I don't know but then immediately after this song it's like a night and day difference on the track hard to love Abel's voice is clear it's up front it gleams like a Moonbeam with moths dancing through it majestically and the song itself is so sad and so cute really given me some postal service vibes this is truly a song that Ben Gibbard would write it also helps the instrumental is subtly glitchy and has a very heavy IDM slant as well but the following scared to live is also really good even though it comes from a very different place stylistically the way this thing kicks off it's a dramatic spotlit ballad the vocals are gorgeous and there's a sheen on this cut that just kind of throws it back to the 80s good performance from Abel and I love how the instrumentation gets a little thicker a little more lush as the whole thing progresses along especially with those classic 80s drum fills and jerky weird vocal sample bits no idea what that is but it still adds a lot of color to the track the next few songs in the tracklist are not quite as tuneful not as hooky but they are still an OK vibe there is snow child where we hear abel singing essentially about his progression pre blowing up to now telling us about how his lifestyle has changed over the years and I suppose it has been a while since the original trilogy mixtape so abel has a lot to reflect on even though it's not a bad topic i do wish the verse melody was better and that the chorus felt less like an afterthought and from the tone of the lyrics to the beat that sounds like an if you're reading this leftover the song escape from la kind of runs like your usual drake wellness check but at one point the track suddenly shifts into a dreamy diatribe about how abel has everything he wants now except you of course there's a sex scene in the music studio not the greatest resolution of any story I've ever heard Faye's was another highlight for me in the tracklist a multi-phased cut with a groovy and synth heavy instrumental another 80s sheen on this one too not to say Abel is continuously ripping off New Wave in a horrible way across this record it's just a sound and style that I think he realizes as well that his usual aesthetic maps over so easily and so efficiently without having to change things up too much just works but yes the more lush and dreamy portions of this track are gorgeous I love the cinematic outro as well where able is kind of narrating his own addiction to this fast lifestyle that he that he can't stop writing songs about he can't get away from it he's losing faith as a result of that it's pretty dramatic the song in your eyes is another new wave number one of the strongest here a bump in beat great song some MJ vibes coming off the vocals and a strong sax solo over the bridge save your tears is a milder cut in this vein as well but still a highlight I have to admit I love the pumping synths on this track quite a bit they feel like something you would typically hear out of a lost European synth pop obscurity it's funny how deeply into this sound able is digging for ideas and just coming out with gems because he easily could have taken the lazy route and just done some bad 80s pop pastiche for tract after another and he didn't however I thought the repeat after me interlude was a huge drop in quality pretty much reminded me of exactly why I didn't like the first two tracks here after hours the title track is a pretty powerful placement toward the end of this record and until I bleed out I suppose is an OK closer certainly a stronger moment than the intro track but Abel spends a lot of time building this track up to only for the very slow-motion beat and pain vocals to meet a pretty abrupt end still overall I thought after hours was a pretty good album there are a handful of tracks that either I don't care for or I thought sort of killed the momentum of the record but this album contains some of Abel's most catchy and infectious works yet and not to downplay the groundbreaking sounds and ideas he forged during that mixtape era but after hours isn't just sounding good it's sounding like a new beginning I'm feeling a light too decent 7 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which entire of you next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana the weekend forever 
1VICcu5AX0k,hi hey hello everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you are doing well and it is time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the worst and the best tracks of the week they are all linked down below as usual also down below our turntable lab link which we get kicked back from if you buy a colorful pressing of a record we have reviewed on the channel over there also our patreon page if you want to get some extra bonus monthly content and support the channel and everything we do in the process and also is a link to our sponsor the good people over at the bridge who make these nice nifty metal plated minimalist wallets that fit nicely in your front pocket replace your disgusting filthy gross vomit-inducing bulky leather wallet today and upgrade my man alright let's get into a quick shout out as they have recently unearthed some old art blakey recordings we will link you to one down below and seems like for jazz heads who you know loved the Jazz Messengers this is gonna be a cool little sort of retrospective LP you know archival release so just coolin Art Blakey Jazz Messengers hell yes let's get into the worst tracks of the week what I felt were the worst tracks of the week the most uninteresting the most underwhelming tracks of the week but BAM one this new track from ybn de Mer featuring gez and offset is just a very generic trap banger with a few cringy lines here and there very very little in terms of chemistry between everybody on the track has a lot of name recognition but not a whole lot of memorability moving on from there Rico nasties new track over here lightning I think is one of her least likable singles in a long time not only does it see her going down that auto-tuned route which she does come out with a good jam in that style every once in a while but this is not one of her better songs in that vein and on top of it what really ends up kneecapping the song is that there's not much in terms of a catchy flow or even a great vocal melody coming out of the song I don't know why she played the the the auto-tune and the instrumental so glitzy if she was going to be so aggressive on the track and not really like you know give us anything super hooky with it it seems like kind of like a delivery and and you know sort of like an aggressive tone that she would take on one of her you know like metal infused bangers but this just sort of seems out of place I guess we have also another track from purity ring which for whatever reason this one reminds me of like if Grimes was trying to be super commercial and like right radio pop hits but was was falling terribly short of doing anything actually appealing the the name of this new track over here is peaceful and we also have a track from a division featuring snow Allegra between us which is a horrendously bland alternative R&B with super sleepy you vocals sort of sensual beat but not a whole lot in terms of personality we have a track also from Conan gray who just dropped a new record this really this week kid crow and this one over here wish you were sober is a super I guess overly commercial very very very cleanly produced to the point where it's soulless piece of synth pop with a lot of hints and nods to just bad millennial pop not really getting the appeal of this frankly moving on from there well let's get into the math section of the video essentially the songs I wasn't crazy about but you might like them more than me first off we have a new track from the Australian outfit tropical frick storm and this one seems really intentionally lo-fi but I'm not caring for the production anyway it just seems very sunburned and everything is is kind of clashing in a way that's really difficult to enjoy still it does sound absurd and very left-field like any good tropical freak storm track does maybe it's a song that will appeal to me a bit more as I hear it in context with a new album or some like that we also have a new track from Thundercat song that actually I was hoping to just hear once the album dropped the cut off the record that features Lil B and also features ty dolla sign and sadly while I do like the instrumental on I think ty kills it B's verse came off very awkward maybe it's something I need to sort of acclimate myself to with further listens I mean Lil B being the outsider artist genuinely that he is of course I couldn't have it like expected him to play it super straight on this song but yet it is kind of like an odd placement and an odd performance fair chances the name of the song if you end up checking it out we have also a new track from shura elevator girl featuring ivy soul and it's a very low-key chill piece of R&B with a pop edge and a pretty creative instrumental the vocals were maybe a little bit too sleepy for me but still I thought it was generally a good good tune a good song we have also a new track from MGMT as you move through the world and it's a very odd lengthy mostly experimental and instrumental psychedelic piece parts of which remind me of Flaming Lips parts of which remind me of Animal Collective parts of which seem original to MGMT itself it's unlike anything that you could compare to their last track their last big single or anything off of their last record honestly it's been a while since they've done something this out there and even that stuff this blows out of the water a little bit because there's some very abrasive parts and it's very lengthy and it's it's very uh I guess lightning in a bottle I guess you could say give it a try give it a shot it's a curious track and it's one that I am open to and maybe having grow on me a little bit once once I give it some more lessons but I found it more off-putting at first than anything but still still pretty curious about what this track is and where it might lead to with the duo's music in the future we also have a couple of new track from Mac Miller which come off of the deluxe version of his posthumous record circles of floating and right and while there are some elements instrumentally of both that I think are pretty cool neither very obviously received the same kind of meticulous mixing and mastering that pretty much every track off of circles did so as a result its kind of difficult to enjoy them as all the other tracks off of circles that were fantastic so yeah I thought they were okay even some of the singing on the tracks reminded me more of swimming than it did the circles material so that was personally a turn-off but for some of you or maybe more of a fan or love that record a lot to this might be a right up your alley so I thought these tracks are okay not too crazy about them but you know it's not a big deal to me personally because they're just bonus tracks they're just deluxe tracks and circles itself is just a really great statement and once again you know rest in peace Mac Miller moving on from there we have a the track amarillo from a J Balvin 's new record which is out now not too crazy about this one III think he takes a somewhat eccentric approach to a two reggaeton certainly on this track and the instrumental is pretty colorful but that being said the vocal performance is really really underwhelming and not all that interesting at all yeah I just I just find it - sure it's young its youthful its you know not doing the same shit the genre did back in the 2000s but it's still seems like a little behind the curve in a way especially with a bad bunny's record turning out as good as it did we have another track from Hayley Williams this one over here is a roses Lotus viola excuse me roses Lotus violet iris a featuring boy genius and this is yet another single from Hayley where it instrumental II just feel like more Radiohead worship I just don't really get it I mean not that Radiohead is a bad influence to have but the instrumental here really to me breathes something like that what could have been on a even King of Limbs you know King of Limbs maybe in rainbows and I don't know I mean the song itself is okay I feel like Haley doesn't really put an interesting spin on this this delivery and this instrumental style I think it's okay you know I just merely think it's okay like much of what she has put out so far I'm just kind of waiting for that moment where what she's doing either clicks or she hits upon something that feels even the least bit distinct so I don't know I don't know we have another track cover actually one from Dirty Projectors who I know many of you may have seen that really horrible celebrities video where they were singing imagine like you know from there you know just cooped up in their million-dollar apartments and you know freaking bungalows and Hollywood Hills mansions and this is a John Lennon cover because sort of like a John Lennon cover under quarantine proper as this is a cover of the John Lennon song isolation and while the vocals are a little rough I do like the track I'd like it a little bit I think the instrumental is quite nice and you know I think the intent behind this is pretty smart so you know amen to a Dirty Projectors let's move on to control top this is a group I'm just now kind of learning about one good day as the name of this song and it's a very punchy ass-kickin driving piece of dance punky rock with just like you know kind of a rowdy attitude I'm not the most original or best production or sound that I've heard in my entire life I mean there have been groups like this you know around since I mean there was there was actually what I want to say is there's sort of an explosion of bands that sounded a little bit like this in the 2000s and I do appreciate this band is bringing that back a little bit and you know it's again not like the most original thing I've heard in this style but it is a pretty decent it's got a good got a good groove to it good energy to it we have another track from behold the octopus extreme experimental instrumental metal outfit which I believe still has Colin Marston in it I mean I can't imagine the band without him as he's definitely one of the most centric and out there dudes in metal of all-time and I mean behold the octopus is definitely something I can't see continuing without him but still that being said it's a very odd song from behold the arcticus and I appreciate that they're always pushing the envelope and doing something strange blessing in disgust is the name of this new track over here and while that wild technical guitar wizardry that you typically get out of their music is their the the rhythms and the drums are very primal rudimentary and recorded in a very noisy fashion it's almost like I'm listening to strange progressive metal from the future but then like a rhythm section you would catch off of a Captain Beefheart song or something it's it's really that out there I did find it a little off-putting but I am very curious as to what this new octopus record is going to sound like so I guess we'll see when it ends up dropping we have a new track from the avalanches featuring ping Sifu as well as a reverse Cuomo of Weezer Fame running red lights is the name of the song did a review of this over on the Fantana channel as well I thought it was okay and I don't know it just kind of sounds like a gorilla song to me just just a somewhat underwhelming gorillas song without 2d on it sort of a sort of a synth II psych pop ballad approach to the whole thing that's a little tame impala esque as well I've just seemed really derivative and not nearly as enjoyable as that classic avalanches stuff let's move on to the tracks that I thought were the best ones this week the ones that really kind of left a a positive impression on me shall we we have a new track from the radio department it's been a while since these dream poppers have a dropped a pretty good track you fear the wrong thing baby is the name of this new one and it's just got good smooth production great vibe great hook and super alluring so give it a try give it a shot we have also a new track from Swain rock band Swain it is a cover crossbones style of the cow power song they're they sort of do their own little uh rendition of that and it is quite nice and very forlorn we have a new track from run the jewels which is kind of a short banger a taster I imagine this kind of readying us for our tj4 and it's pretty hard you know killer Mike can help you have good chemistry on it killer Mike's bars are nasty the beat is bumping his fuck and it just sounds you know like the type of futuristic hardcore hip-hop that they're known for it just makes you just drop a frown and just mmm your food to it it doesn't have as strong a chorus as I typically expect from an rtj song or anything but you know it's got me excited for the future as it does sound like maybe the production is a bit more updated a bit more progressive this time around so you know I guess I guess well I guess well here I guess we'll see moving on from there we have a new track from perfume genius where we have Mike essentially dipping a little bit into the world of synth pop but in his own weird way I love that Mike sort of puts his own twist on the sound and style on this cut on the floor and it's attached to a pretty intriguing dance video as well so give it a try we have a new track from old man gloom sludge metal outfit old man gloom who previously I've heard tracks that kick ass from I've heard projects from that I've just been very neutral on but this new song over here is a rager it's a rager EMF is the title of it and riffs are badass drums are badass mixes hardest fuck so give it a try give it a shot give it a listen we have also a new track from n le choppa I have not talked about on the channel yet I don't think even though he has been totally killing it and just doing tons of numbers you know really building his brand and his shit from the ground up and you know total respect for that great instrumental on this one it's essentially a trap ballad of sorts but the vocal line is really good and NLE choppa his vocal performance is sweet and a rowdy riches on the track so you know his feature is going to kill it so the vocals back-to-back are good instrumental quality the song and to nurse straight they're solid so nothing not to like about this one honestly we have a new track from Krauss Colin Marsden turning up in this this video twice what the hell is Colin doing he's just droppin tons of shit the wheel is the name of this new track from Krauss and their continued exploration into the worlds of extreme metal and progressive metal and black metal continue on this new track that is not too lengthy or anything like that but it does go pretty hard and does feature some pretty savage vocals and winding dizzying guitar lines it's just as out there as Crowley's tends to be although their latest stuff does tend to be kind of breaking away from a lot of the more traditional black metal forms and just going a way to more progressive ideas and more experimental ideas and I mean while that has been hit-or-miss this is you know an error for Krauss that I am pretty intrigued to see what's going to come next because it sort of seems like they're throwing a lot of you know just ideas at the wall and seeing what sticks so and and again I'm thinking this this track over here is an example of a kind of a high point in this most recent era of the Bands career so moving on from there JPEG mafia comes through with a new track I'm covered in money and as much as I liked his last single and thought that the instrumental and the flow reminded me of moments from veteran and I suppose that was cool I was also coming away from his thinking you know I also I also want to hear him do something new you know JPEG mafia is such an adventurous and a groundbreaking artist I would love to hear him just continuing to kind of push the envelope forward and he certainly does that on this track he has a super in-your-face delivery he has a strange flow and a weird ass beat that is really visceral but the grooves are odd man the grooves are odd and the the sound effects and the samples he works into it are strange too I'm not even sure how to describe it at this point they kind of freaked me out a little bit in a good way it just seemed like such a weird fucking idea and concept to ride with and yet it sort of turned out really good so shout out to Peggy for continuing to break the mold in the way that he does we have a track that I wanted to recommend to you but really an entire project actually the sawdust facts versus time and it comes from a new surprise dropped ambient record from Clarins clarity the best songs I've sampled from the projects so far are kind of like futuristic New Age synth e-type cuts that again are very ambient and formless and to have some really bright synth Tambor's and in you know feel very euphoric in a way but almost dystopian given the times that we exist in right now but again facts versus the time is is the track I'd love for you guys to check out but if you dig that try out the whole thing the whole project is out now and it's got some highlights on it certainly got some highlights on it so that is gonna be it that's the weekly track roundup everybody hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this one once more all of those songs and everything are linked down below along with a you know our sponsor the rich

kJb6Lz5frq4,oh hi everyone here the internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new rap Ferrera project purple moonlight pages this is the newest full-length LP from rapper poet producer Rory Ferreira AKA milo AKA black Orpheus aka scallops hotel AKA rap Ferreira now under under this most recent pseudonym Rory originally broke way back in 2011 under the name milo and for the rest of the decade he remained one of the most consistent artists in the underground for Rory this past ten years has been quite a metamorphosis moving from a fledgling hip-hop trio to a successful solo career then from a short-lived but beloved hip-hop collective and now he runs his own label Ruby yacht his sound over this course of time has evolved quite a bit too at one point many of his songs ran very light hearted and nerdy and the further milo went down the road the more abstract experimental heady and almost difficult to wrestle with his work became not to say he's gotten worse but processing some of his songs feels like the hip-hop equivalent of reading some Immanuel Kant that's more or less been the phase he's operated in as of late and when releasing music as scallops Hotel he seems to be more concerned with just being out in the fray than being coherent but Milo seems to be gaining a new focus on this latest project of his over here which features production programming and live instrumentation from not only Kenny Segal but also California's Jefferson Park boys and I'm very happy to hear about this instrumental change up as I think Milo is starting to slowly push himself into a corner by dropping one loop ESP 404 sermon after another which it's a great piece of hardware and is is absolutely legendary and super versatile as well but the added instrumentation and you know the added production brains on this just makes the instrumental pallets on this thing a lot more dynamic so what Rory is doing now off of that changeup is coming through with a robust and slick album of just one jazz rap track after another really throwing it back to these genres most significant forms and doing them an incredible amount of justice now of course jazz rap is far from dead the genre had some amazing highlights in the 2010s from t PAB to the return of A Tribe Called Quest with that great final record also new envelope pushers like injury reserve and with his own sound in his own way Rory is making sure the genre puts its best foot forward into the 2020s this album is 18 tracks long and a vast majority of them are clever curious and classy charismatic - from end to end the track decorum is essentially a statement of intent for the album also a very dramatic proclamation of those involved with the record - as Rory sounds like some kind of hip-hop philosopher-king also on the track he calls out the fence building nihilists which seems like a pretty obvious nod to our current political and social state while I'm sure a lot of old heads could get down with the sound and the vibe of this project it's still very much for modern times Green's is the first real taste we get of music on this record and of course it is backed up with these jazzy keys fat beats nimble bass a superb amount of flow and personality coming from Rory yeah he is not reinventing the jazz rap wheel that much is clear but his experience and ability at this point speaks volumes here he is no longer the young padawan lyricist we knew back in 2011 he is now someone who has made it through the most transformational and saturated decade in hip-hop history and he sounds like it while there isn't a whole lot of conceptual or thematic focus too many of these tracks Rory is constantly dropping all of these great mindset gems a warrior doesn't need to test their mettle stay blessed and then he kissed every petal found the pain quite quite quite humbling you know the self is defined by the struggling all these scattered lines ideas suggestions points of view they all coalesce into a greater ethos that's essentially given out in pieces just small nuggets reflecting on the world life the human condition and beyond considering this Rory is a creative descendant of acts like diggable planets as well as De La Soul and basically anything Madlib has touched which is true of his past work as well but it's manifesting itself in a different way here one more thing to keep in mind here is that there aren't a whole lot of hooks or traditional structures to this project something I want to say even if Rory and abstract hip hop fans are just accepting that as a given though there is a very dreamy and alluring hook on the track leaving hell which is a very jazzy and pretty still what I want to say is that the courses are not entirely necessary on this project as they are easily made up for with great lyrics good flows grooves humour versatility nasty and detailed production like the gorgeous omens and totems which borders on spoken word over ambient music at some points some of the instrumental shifts on this track too are quite cinematic the song dust-up later on the record takes on an ambient tone too but this one even darker and Rory on top of it sounding more authoritative and Stern than I think he's ever been with absolutes we get some very clunky boom-bap with plucky strange instrumentation that makes the groove even harder this one is a total head bobber laced with record scratches oh and the instrumental on you dig it just makes me go especially once those dusty distant pianos and grand string sections swoop in just making it sound like my lows verses are commanding this vork astre there are further highlights on the record that are worth going over because each song really does have its own instrumental palette and emotional quality such as the surreal dream state like lyrics on the song pinball where it at least feels like Milo is rapping from a strange place he eventually arrives at a refrain where he is tributing Zev of X or MF DOOM one of his obvious influences the track also features these wonderfully weepy string samples and a solid open mike eagle appearance - on the track an idea is a work of art lyrically and in vocally Milo sounds totally off of his rocker easily his most eccentric set of bars on the entire project and it's set over an instrumental that sounds like a jazzy lullaby the track no starving artists as a beat that is almost danceable it's almost like an allusion to hip house it reminds me of of what gold links music would sound like if it were just just better and was also trying to cross over to like nerdy backpackers the song laundry feels more like a classic Milo moment in my opinion as it's a pretty light on the ears and not too emotionally heavy or anything like that and Milo lyrically is is just kind of focusing on on laundry making all sorts of funny references and also trying to pull anything metaphorically out of that concept that he can and on cycles Milo puts forward what sounds like a very despondent series of experiences releasing his stuff just operating in the music industry he mentions not just wasting time with the wrong people but also depicting artists as just fighting against the injustice of the world but being battered and bruised because their weapons are essentially like brushes and pens the track is very great be I will say that but I can't deny he's he spittin facts so of course with this tracklist being a bit scattered and 18 songs long there are going to be some cuts that are just a little underwhelming and in the case of purple moonlight pages there are moments that feel just a bit too standard or low risk for this style a little sleepy golden sardine row talk unfortunately and also doldrums even though I do appreciate the the concentrated moodiness of that track but the most awkward moment on the album has to go to the casually sung outro master plan the singing just isn't very good however the track seems to be a fair of Sanders cover on which the singing is a little unorthodox anyway but the way Milo is giggling over various parts of his own dition here makes me wonder how seriously is he taking the track and what exactly is he laughing at is he laughing at himself his own weird performance of the song the tracks message of a creator having a master plan I mean I assume he genuinely enjoys it but there are points where he seems to be saying the lyrics in a somewhat tongue-in-cheek way either way I'm not totally surprised by the tone and the delivery of this cover as Milo tends to be a bit of a post post ironic conundrum having said that this is easily one of Milo's best projects one of the best rap releases we've had so far this year and as I stated very clearly earlier just a damn good jazz rap album with plenty of spots that come off funny or insightful conscious as well as abstract and despite the lack of a big clear concept pulling all of these tracks together somehow they all add up into one of Milo's best self-portraits ever feeling a light to decent 8 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you should check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana rap Ferreira forever

ANmdYZdKiWY,hi everyone flossing boss Hannah here the Internet's pissed music nerd and it's time for a review of the new lil Uzi vert project lil Uzi vert vs. the world to Philly rapper lil Uzi vert he's back once again with a deluxe version of the record he has just dropped eternal a take just put that out last week his first record in years finally quenching the thirst of fans who feared that the industry killed any chance of eternal a--take seeing the light of day so the album came and while there was a lot of fanfare I'm personally not sure if it was really worth the wait while EA does have some forward-thinking production and at least a nod to some semblance of a concept it also sounds like Suzie hasn't spent any of the past three years progressing his sound or his style in any way shape or form it's like the dudes been locked in a time capsule since 2017 and they just broke him out for this record meanwhile Newsies contemporaries have spent that same amount of time progressing pushing the envelope staying ahead of the curve that he is now behind and I guess to add to the numbers and the hype on this release Suzie has now put out a deluxe version but this is not your standard reissue of an album with a few extra bonus tracks know what Ozzy has done here is stacked an entirely different project on top of his already existing project essentially the sequel to his 2016 mixtape that was inspired by the Scott Pilgrim franchise now even though I was underwhelmed by a good deal of eternal a take I do have to give it to Izzy these do sound like two very separate projects with their own qualities and personalities if doing a general side-by-side comparison I would say that versus the world two has punchy urbeats crisper mixes way way way way way more features some of the choruses pop a bit more - as the songs they're packed into are more cleanly structured and I suppose with no space inspired aesthetics dominating the entire record like on Susy is a bit freer to sample different sounds and styles although much of the time the beats he grabs a pretty typical for modern trap or you know just a lot of Pierre Bourne production which is pretty trendy right now so those are some of the most obvious differences between these two projects with that being said though it's not like Susie has turned a new leaf on this thing either his pen game and his delivery has flows are pretty much what you can expect at this point think of how it would sound flew Wayne was born a SoundCloud rapper but had no concept of one-liners or wordplay now whose e does hit upon some very good vocal lines on this record here and there like on moon relate where the vocal inflections are insane also the refrains on come this way are pretty sticky as well and while I like what the more prominent placement in the mix that oozes voice receives does for his singing when it is good by that same token hearing his voice in a clearer state does expose how obnoxious it is on certain tracks like on Lotus where the singing is just straight trash and also what happens at this volume is it becomes very apparent just how off tempo and rambly a lot of oohs ease rapping is - and not in a weird left field or even endearing blue-faced type of way either but goosies flows on the second half of I can show you very much a mess also his verse on Strawberry peals where he barely takes up that much room on his own track and is totally outshined by young thug that's the other thing it's kind of weird just how much Ozzy allows his guests on this project to completely overtake his songs or just turn him into the least interesting thing on his own song like 21 savage on yes or ski who is pretty much all over two-thirds of that track this is also the same situation with the closer leaders which not only features an instrumental that reads a lot like the stage music to a Mario Kart level which I I love but it also features an appearance from nav yes this nav over here this nav and believe it or not it's his best feature ever literally sure he still sounds pretty robotic but it works within the context of this very synthetic and dreamy instrumental the vocal melody goes a long way too we also have a great and very insanely aggressive little Dirk feature on here that stops the show young thug's appearances go the extra mile and even Chief Keef in his own weird way is the most interesting thing on being so again a vast majority of the features on this thing do make the songs to the point where they would not be worth releasing if they were not there in the same way that the production did so much of the legwork on e a you have a guest appearances from 21 savage and young thug and future the the they're pretty much doing the same thing which is why tracks like Myron and I can show you rank as some of the most drab songs in this tracklist so those are my general thoughts on these deluxe tracks I'm not sure what I need to say beyond here maybe you want me to dissect every single reference Ozzy makes to getting head we could do that but that would make this the most tedious a YouTube video ever because again while it is a slight improvement over EA it's not like Ozzy is putting a whole lot of structural or a lyrical focus into these tracks so at the end of the day while there are elements of verses the world to that I like it's like it is swapping out various qualities with EA one project has flaws the other one doesn't both have fundamental issues that carry through both one has a louder and clearer sound with lots of enjoyable features while the other has more interesting production and I guess more aesthetic cohesion but I'm still not all that crazy about either honestly I'm feeling a light 5 on this one transition have you given this deluxe edition a listen if you did did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the only two subscribe to the channel you're the best you're the best I hope you have a good day staying inside not getting sick not getting other people sick take care of yourself and each other Anthony Fantana little Z vert forever 
KEtb3CuLb4U,hey-hey-hey-hey hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it is time for another edition of our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the worst and the best tracks of the week first a few shout outs before we get into all the songs linked down below of course first our turntable lab link which if you hit that up get a colorful pressing of a record over there we get kickback from it so shout out to them that's amazing that's awesome also our patreon page gets some bonus monthly content exclusive to that page which supports the show and everything we do so we appreciate all who sign up over there shout out to our sponsor for ever the good people over at the ridge they make these awesome nifty metal plated wallets that fit nicely in your front pocket link down below promo code Mellon 10% off and shout out to these songs for Australia charity compilation you know despite the viral insanity going on across the world right now that they are still kind of reeling from the whole wildfires thing and there are a lot of great artists on this new compilation covering Australian artists and songs including the national curve vile damien rice and more so give it a listen give it a try give it a stream as there are some great tracks on there and let's get into the worst tracks of the week what I thought were the worst tracks of the week there's a handful there's quite a few we're gonna have to talk about all of them even even if it does hurt just a wee little bit first not really liking the new little yadi single featuring - baby and Drake the more that I listen to it it's really an underachievement of a single should have been bigger should have been better should have had a better beat should have had a better song but instead it just has a lot of star power but not a whole lot in terms of substance or good writing good performances so uh I think Drake maybe stands out the most on the track but he doesn't do enough to save the song not not that it's Drake's responsibility to save these save the song that he's merely a feature on anyway but but still we also have Steven Wilson over here who has a new track titled personal shopper which sees mr. Wilson kind of going in a bit of a new wave direction I guess you could say with a horrendously laughable hook don't know what the man is thinking on this one I feel like ever since he's kind of drifted away from porcupine tree and then indulged in a lot of the classic progressive rock isms that have kind of inspired his music over the years he's really sort of trying to I guess experiment with and find himself through a lot of different sounds and styles and this is yet another I guess step in that direction but doesn't really pan out I think it's something that you really have to love everything Wilson does to be into because I do not think he does much for this style of music but that's just me I guess also this new track myron from the deluxe edition of lulu sieverts ternal a take which is essentially lose a little woozy versus the world to kind of just stacking two records on top of each other essentially and yeah it just kind of sounds like your typical underwhelming by the numbers Suzy song not really seeing the point of adding this track and potentially a bunch of others that sound just just like it to this new record but you know I guess moving on from there we have a new track from tyga' freak which is proof that even Meghan the stallion cannot save the mediocrity of Tyga as his rapping sucks on this track instrumental pretty scant you know obviously the topic of the song is pretty clear and I guess relatively focused but still it's it's a pretty corny track in my opinion and we also have another song which there have been quite a few of and I haven't really commented on them to any extent from Sufjan Stevens and Lowell Brahms and this record they've been teasing toward this somewhat classical somewhat experimental instrumental record climb that mountain is the title of the track I don't know just every song I've been hearing so far is just really I suppose trying to be elegant epic a little left-field I'm not really entirely sure what to make of a lot of this material they've been teasing with so far I mean maybe on the record it will all come together in a very grand fashion but so far nearly every tractor sounds to short-winded to really build up anything it's a kind of like a I don't know very layered motifs that could use more development could use more sound plays something I mean I appreciate the combination of influences though it's not you know totally a brand new thing for Sufjan Stevens to be indulging in music that is instrumental or classically influenced but I don't know just uh not really feeling this material so far and new Nicholas jar track Thunder which is a somewhat strange electronics and eyes spoken word piece I guess I mean the the vocals on the track are really tedious and the instrumental could have used a lot more progression to is safe to say the against all logic stuff is a lot better than this safe to say safe to say let's move into the tracks that I thought were met not blown away by them but still wanted to shout them out point them in your direction you might like them a little more than me so here we go first off we have the new Eve tumor track which is titled to kerosene not so much into the very underwhelming intro on this track as well as the the lyrics which I think are kind of trite however I do think the way the instrumentation layers and a very grand and epic fashion after the first leg is really cool I like the the extra voice on the track too which is very beautiful there are definitely some elements of the track I find to be elegant and you know certainly left-field for a modern rock track whereas it feels like most artists influenced by the genre kind of spinning their wheels and the mud I will admit this project does seem to be kind of pushing forward in some sense I just think some of the writing could have been better some of the writing and some of the the pacing could have been better alright we also have this a new track over here from Yugi waking up down which features some elements of electronic music bedroom pop it's it's a cool combination of sounds but at the end of the day just the whole thing the vocals the instrumental everything just felt way too faint to me like I just wanted a bit more punch to the song or something even the chorus doesn't really go as hard as I would have liked but I know there are a lot of fans of this project and if you've been enjoying everything that has been coming out from it so far I think you might love this track might even be one of your favorites from this so far as the instrumental did at least strike me as being a bit more colorful and playful we also have a new track from sesame mess which is a kind of a 90s rock throwback some of the guitar tones remind me a little bit of some classic National Smashing Pumpkins the vocals are okay it's it's just a very by-the-numbers throwback kind of rock tune but it's still good production performance we also have over here a new track from Prairie --nt which has a title that I'm not going to say because it'll most likely get us demonetised but I will put this I guess the the the soundcloud page this comes from into the description box down below where you can check it out for yourself one of Dom's more noisy and droney cuts though I do find the kind of spoken word bits that are distorted in place throughout the song to kind of take me out of the vibe of the track though I do like the epic progression of the song very incredibly abrasive finale is is actually really awesome we also have over here a track from Luke Snyder a Third Man Records artist and the label is essentially pitching him as like this pioneer in the world of pedal steel and I mean I will admit I don't think I've heard a song before that featured pedal steel so proudest ounds like this it's essentially a kind of like a new agey ambient cut but led by pedal steel but the way the pedal steel is treated on the track it doesn't really sound that far off from just like what you might hear on a guitar song or something but still not the context you usually hear pedal steel in some of the synth Tambor's as well I think are a little bland but the once more not not a context you usually hear the the instrument in and certainly worth a nod you know it's it's thing I'm curious about the future of you know could could get better could get more interesting we have also a new track from Kalani over here toxic I think some of the vocal licks on this track are really good but it's just continually disappointing that a singer as good as Kalani is continuously falls into all of these very by-the-numbers super atmospheric moody structurally deficient just stereotypes that a lot of modern army does I just think she's better she's capable of so much more but she just never achieves it for whatever reason we also have a new track over here from Donald Glover childish gambino time featuring ariana grande which I did a short review of over on the Fantana channel I thought this one had a very cool combination of influences but I am wondering and hoping that this is maybe a bit of a rough draft of something we're going to hear in the future because the the balance of the instrumentation on this track and the mix is whacked totally whacked as the drums are booming crushing everything else the vocal manipulation is a little harsh and abrasive at times though I do like the gospel influences the 80s influences the Konya influences the vocal performances are good and the tune itself is really triumphant and I think hopeful in a way so I'm looking forward to hearing what this may develop into but still hoping for some kind of development we have also a new track from dear Dorian who you might know from the time she spent at one time in Dirty Projectors and this track of hers is very psychedelic driving krautrock Ian I guess you could say saturnine Knight is the name of the cut and while I do like the groove I do like the drive I do like the linear progression of the song I think that she could have done a better job of kind of coloring that groove with her voice or really anything else on the track to kind of give some more sense of progression or just make it a bit bolder more exciting we have also over here the track stone cold' who is working with Kenny beats on never mind what I'm trying to say here's song a stone-cold Kenny beats is on the track and the artist is dead never and I mean it's got a fun music video this the actual song itself is kind of like a very low-key piece of sort of summary bedroom poppy I guess slightly hip hop inspired to just pop music everything is a really slacker ish about the song which is is certainly a vibe that appeals to a lot of people even today it's just always kind of being presented in a totally new context and you know if this is kind of the new wave of that I mean that's cool that's fine I'm down with it I I still think the song and the vocal performance is kind of underwhelming but it's interesting to see how this kind of mood and vibe an attitude within new young popular relevant music take shape time and time and time again we have a new track also from quirky which is I guess a newer band fronted by none other than Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat Fame and evens Fame and speaking of evens this band this track pretty much just sounds like an even song which at this point in a ins career I guess you can't be too surprised by however I do very much prefer everything he did in evens to this and don't quite see the point of this offshoot as of right now the the tune is OK the production and instrumental palates really underwhelming and typical for Ian anyway we have a few tracks from the trolls world tour which you know not to laugh too much because there was that cut with scissors and Timberlake that was actually very good however we have a few with a Justin and Anderson pack this time around don't slack and it's all love with mary j blige and george clinton however both i find to be very over produced a little too sugary groove deficient and i don't know the vocal performances to me just felt a lot hokey ER then they did on the timberlake in scissor track and the vocal processing especially on its all love like when they're harmonizing it's terrible so you know sounds like some bad movie soundtrack pop though you know anderson and just and vocally do do quite a bit to save it so you know it's it's not that bad all right best tracks of the week best tracks of the week which there are quite a few of so pay attention all linked down below we have vagabond who some of you may be confused hey Anthony this is vagabonds last record that came out a little while ago and that is true but vagabond has released a music video to the song in a bind but like a string back version of the song that is more stark and minimal and Fulks ear and I'm loving this version the vocals are just so much stronger and I feel like the the tenderness of them stands out so much more in a way it kind of reminds me of like an old Niko song but but totally different in at least in a way loving the strings on the track - I'm just loving this presentation I think just kind of goes to show that you know what has continued to underwhelm me about vagabonds music is that it's not presented in a very interesting way you know stylistically and instrumentally if she was to do more songs in this direction I mean potentially it could be great because this is actually stunning you know beautifully stunning it's it's just that a lot of her songs have been wrapped in such a plain very by the numbers in the eccentric instrumentation this to me is is a lot better this is more of a you know very elegant chamber full kind of thing which I don't know if all of her fans are going to be into if this is kind of a change or a metamorphosis that she makes but I'm loving it I think it's really good we have also over here a new single from The Killers featuring Lindsey Buckingham and it's a it's it's a rager it's a rager it is a synth pop rock rager with of course with a lot of killer songs you do have that driving rocking Springsteen influence and the sensor really prominent and mr. flowers is given a totally killer vocal performance it's it's a great anthemic tune liking it a lot we also have a new track from Sharon Van Etten's staring at a mountain from the never rarely sometimes always soundtrack and it is a very beautiful elegant piano tune that is very moody very low-key but I'm still liking how uh emotionally intense the song is we also have a new track we're here from proto martyr who is sounding more savage than ever in my view they take a really dramatic approach to a these classic post-punk tropes and sounds that to at least me sounds refreshing despite them not really reinventing the wheel when it comes to this style this new song over here that they just dropped I want to make sure I drop the title to you guys's processed by the boys moving on from there we have a new track from Porter Robinson which I'm actually liking quite a bit surprisingly something comforting is the name of it and I'm liking the balance of electronics and in folk instrumentation and very bright somewhat cheery hopeful vocals on this track a lot like in the progression of the song too the textures are so much better than a lot of what was on Robinson's last record just sticking it quite a bit I'm looking forward to this new project it seems like it could be really cool in Robinson I think has been making the effort over the past two years not just through a music under his own name but I know he's had some stuff out on the side you know under some some other other pseudonyms or you know at least one but the point I'm trying to make here is that um seems like texturally is getting a bit more adventurous and I think it's paying off and in you know in the material that he's been teasing with so far we also have a new track from Norah Jones with Jeff Tweedy playing on it as well it's a very folksy singer-songwriter tune but of course you know there's the subtle touches of jazz and the vocals and the piano as well that's a very sweet nice song you know maybe a little uh to NPR ish you know a little to tote bag but it's it's still good - still a great tune and you know good vocal performance as well as Nora continues to show you know there's a lot of skill and power in in the way she she's sort of uh States things vocally in in such an understated manner you know she doesn't try to oversell a track or anything like that of it still manages to stun sound beautiful and sound compelling we have also over here ooh enact that I have just come into this week and this is some really great postpone this very dark dramatic almost harrowing kind of post-punk model-actress I believe is how you say this uh band's name suntan is the name of the song and yeah it's got some great production great vocals intense performance and it's very dark it is tortured I would say to an extent and you know if you guys are into groups like black MIDI you are probably gonna eff with this pretty heavy too alright lychgate which is a metal group that has just dropped a new EP Futura is the title of this thing and the track from it that I wanted to point your direction is incarnate and this thing is a really cool futuristic seamless blend of black metal death metal progressive metal the clean vocals that slip in here and there are really epic the the guitar solos are really the melodies the lead sound like they're coming from another dimension it's a very grim it's very ugly it's very horrific but also complex with like a touch of sci-fi to it almost as well so I'm liking it quite a bit it sounded really good so which gate check it out and we have also over over here a new track from itsy k-pop group with Believe It or Not some production from Sophie on this track which does add you know some subtle weird notes of stack of texture to the instrumental but it's it's not that different stylistically from a from a lot of k-pop tunes though I will say it does go hard it is a banger it does have some great vocal licks some good vocal harmonies and the beat the beat goes freaking hard a F so I don't know how to tell you it's just a really good song it's just a really good tune it's got a great like I said great beat cool transitions throughout the song as well as it's not just kind of one note you know these songs these k-pop productions are very tightly wound a lot of detail you know also very bright very in-your-face and you know it's not everybody's style of pop but I'm digging it I'm digging it we have also over here a track from the band horselords the common task is their new record it is out now and if you're into a very cool forward-thinking experimental fusion of rock and krautrock you're in watch you're gonna want to check out what they have going on with this new LP People's Park is the name of the song that is a link down below try it it's really good we also have over here girl pool whose stuff a little while back with their last LP I wasn't too crazy about this new song over here though like I'm winning it is a pretty cool breathy low key alternative dance tune at least that's how it came off to me with some good vocals a very dark cinematic in a way the presentation of the singing and the instrumentation I'm liking it I'm diggin it prior once more I was not super crazy and to grow pool but they're doing something a bit more texturally interesting in groovier this time around so I'm feeling it we also have over here a new track from flume featuring Toro y Moi which was a pretty great release for the week the difference is the name of the song flume comes out with some great beats on this thing some great beats grooves transitions Toros voice on the song is OK I mean it's not like a stunning vocal performance in my view but it is worked into the instrumentation as if it's another you know just another sound or something in a way that works you know I don't think again I don't think it's the best singing Toros ever done but it does add to the song and you know I am liking that flume is dropping a big single here that does not just sound like some overly commercial piece of trash or whatever you know this is even even though it's obviously going to appeal to a very wide number of people a much wider number of people than a lot of the stuff off his last mixtape it still is a little left-field so I'm liking that I'm liking it we have also over here a JEP Japanese hip-hop outfit dos Manos have a new track out titled Rojo and it's great it's awesome it's got some cool string samples and the instrumental good flows very left fields very out there as a dos monus's stuff usually tends to be so give it a try give it a shot we have a new track from Code Orange as well which I'm not going to get too deep into as I'm going to review the band's new album this week you and you alone it's heavy it's hard it kicks ass it is just Skull Crushing and I'm excited to hear more tracks like that off of this new record underneath so yeah and ooh here's an artist that I wanted to point in your direction named chica and she's a very good singer and rapper and industry games is the name of her new EP but it's also kind of the title track and the single off of the EP it's got some great flows great lyrics not really sure what else to say about it other than she just seems like a top notch rapper with a ton of potential a lot of talent can write a song as well and I don't know all y'all out there who care about lyrics all y'all out there who are like all these lyrical miracle mf'er 'he's like you got to get on this shit you know not not that she needs and a very cringy Eminem type of audience but like you know if you guys care about bars and you know artists out there who you know aren't mumble rappers I hate mumble rappers you know if that's the kind of thing that turns you off because you want to hear somebody actually rapping give it a listen because it's it's it's really good also Antichrist demon core is back with a new track Satan is king it's been a while since you've heard from these guys at least from an album standpoint they have a new record coming out this year they have peppered the time since their last record I think in 2014 was a lot of EPS and splits and you know there being the grind core and power violence band they are that's not really a surprise it's kind of where a lot of that sound thrives anyway and though this new song over here has crazy riffs awesome performance it's abrasive as fuck and there's a great hook refrain vocal breakdown whatever you want to call it but it's it's a pretty exciting hard-hitting grimy ass cut so a satanist king antichrist team in choir hell yeah and that is going to be it for the weekly track roundup you guys are the best anthony Fantana i hope you enjoyed all the songs or you know check out all the songs that we talked about in the video I will talk to you guys later see you in the next video forever mwah

Ui0JUOZBPls,hello hello hi everyone market in crash Hanna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the two new princess Nokia albums everything is beautiful and everything sucks it's now been a few years since New York rapper and singer Princess Nokia broke onto the scene with those baggy clothes that lovably awkward smile and seemingly multiple personalities on her record 1992 which there was an amazing deluxe version of afterwards she came through on this project with so many different voices and styles but still maintained a lot of distinct character and topical focus whether she was rapping about being a tomboy being a guy her hair New York black magic which makes Nokia a tough artist to box in since she seems to have a different style and direction every time she pops up I mean just look at the changes she underwent in one year from 1992 to the emo rap stylings of a girl cried red and now her two yes two new albums over here which admittedly I did not see coming seem to be a celebration of that princess Nokia's two sides her duality and I guess the personality types that Nokia is trying to get across here are made pretty obvious by the two different titles and visuals on these album covers and even though each record here makes its own statement there is quite a bit of thematic and artistic overlap to take everything is beautiful with its bright cheery fun kids II kind of cover but there is something unsettling about the fake smile and the bloody nose on on this image and even though the front cover of everything sucks reads very much like nihilistic maul goth that edge is taken off just a little bit by that stuffed bear and thematically both records dropped quite a few references to youth growing up maturing still I see a lot of purpose and intent behind separating both of these two records in just how differently each of them vibe take the opening track of everything as beautiful green eggs and ham slick grooves sweet pianos and a splash of gospel influence kinda sounds like a chance the rapper instrumental and Nokia's vocal lines on the track kind of run the same play the rhymes on the track are pretty basic and childish but intentionally so as they seem to reference a simpler time in her life but I don't think there's much of okhla presence on the track and the song ducks out before two minutes is even up so it's it's it's it's an interesting tone setter but not a great song this is somewhat of an issue with a lot of tracks across both of these projects that they are a little scant a little too brief granted I think the more aggressive cuts on everything sucks work a bit better in this format as they leave a stronger impression in a shorter amount of time but being so brief leaves multiple tracks on everything is beautiful feeling sort of fleeting as much as I like the concept of tracks like happy place as well as soul food i adobo lyrically I think both tracks are just scratching the surface and comparison with numerous songs off 1992 that were a lot more robust topically but everything is beautiful still features numerous highlights like the very sentimental and weary wash and sets which is some very dreamy aspirational trap that's pretty relatable a lot of the lyrics on this one dealing in hating growing up hating the responsibilities that come with aging then we have the song Gemini which is a very sweet piece of jazz rap and could effectively work as a mo for the entirety of these two projects as Nokia is taking an astrological angle to explain her different sides her two heads and one eye later into the tracklist we have the song sugar honey iced tea which is one of Nokia's best songs period sugar honey iced tea then bitches don't knock me lyrically it doesn't so much play into the themes of the rest of the record but it's still an impeccably catchy pop rap hit with a great Hornbeck be great chorus entertaining verses swagger for days another highlight here features backing from the New York jazz collective onyx collective also guest vocals from the New York alternative R&B duo ocean and there's some great chemistry on this track it's got a dark psychedelic sound while it doesn't really fit in aesthetically with much of what is on everything is beautiful and maybe it actually could have landed on everything sucks it's still a highlight meanwhile Hart is a short cute self-portrait of sorts where Nokia essentially tells us that she's different which I get is kind of a cliche but when Nokia says it she means it I just wish there was more to the song though I mean Nokia is such a weird and complex character the of what she's shown us so far in her music surely there's more to say on this song than this and it would be something that this track were as short as it is but it connected directly into or was reinforced by tracks that were around it but that's the thing about this album and everything sucks to both records flow very much like compilations of loosely connected ideas unfortunately we have a pretty underwhelming closer on everything as beautiful to the delivery of the poetry on this one is somewhat rambling and while I think Nokia's words on this track are very personal and powerful they end up getting lost in this somewhat rickety instrumental that I think just should have been swapped out for something else now online I've seen some back-and-forth over which of these two projects is the better one and I might prefer everything sucks just a little bit more there's a lot of bang or beats on this one harder hooks slightly more topical focus I think the opening track Harley Quinn hits pretty hard for a whisper rap rager then Balenciaga later on the record is a pretty funny cut about being fashionable on a thrift store budget is sure some of the refrains to me read as having pretty basic lyrics when I first heard the single but it's grown on me with repeated listens but there are at least a few tracks here that are maybe trying to be too edgy like welcome to the circus or a crazy house which I'm pretty sure my sample Jonathan Davis going boom not Oh Emma either that or Nokia is is repeating that vocal line or someone else's and it's being laced into the beat at like a higher pitch they're definitely songs here that sound a pretty much like Maul goth rap that might also have a lot of crossover appeal with Juggalos and 14-year old me is here for it meanwhile I love love love love love the track gross which sounds like some old-school horror core with its eerie synthesizers and murderous trap beat but Nokia is spitting bars over it basically about how grimy she is sleeping on the floor cauldrons locusts stains on the teeth then we have the also very catchy no strings attached boy hungry anthem I like him which is laced with cold blooded flows as well as these funny phone samples and then in a total contrast with everything is beautiful the finisher here is really good pretty devastating emotionally the song just a kid oddly enough stylistically and totally the rapping and even the instrumental to an extent kind of reminds me of Linkin Park which given the look of the front cover I think is a genius like era of music to tap into for this the writing is really tough it's pretty intense as Nokia tells her life story and her basically upbringing that brought her to this point even though these are separate projects with separate experiences and I enjoyed both of them differently and for different reasons I did like both of them together on the whole and I do think that while it doesn't make sense to listen to one right after the other because they don't flow quite like that they are sister projects they are connected they are meant to be enjoyed together in some sense so I suppose I could score them separately and then average that out I felt a strong 6 - a light 7 on AIB and then a strong 7 - a light 8 on yes and together that's pretty much like a decent 7 or so I thought together both these records for Nokia showcased a lot of creativity great concept said a lot about her as an artist and a person but the one thing that weighed both albums down is that each of these records featured so many tracks that were a little short a little too short kind of unfinished bowing out abruptly are not really diving that deeply into their topic of choice still very admirable and respectable of Nokia to try to drop something with this much scope to it and for it to turn out as good as it did transition have you given both of these projects a listen you should and if you have let me know what your thoughts are down in the comments did you love them hate them why what do you think I should review next over here next to my head is another

I4H_vmSQEGs,hi everyone intake channel here the Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for a review of the new loathe album I let it in and it took everything this is the sophomore album of UK band lows which I mostly came upon because it was kicking up some dirt in the metal scene and I was getting some pretty persistent requests to cover this thing curiosity got the best of me and I will admit this album does feature a pretty cool and somewhat unlikely combination of sounds from an era of rock music that I remember pretty vividly ideas that at the time wouldn't have necessarily been mixed together in the way that they are on this record I'm talking thunderous metalcore riffs that are occasionally beefed up to the point where they're super sludgy abrasive maybe think Dillinger Escape Plan but not quite as mathy or complex or even imagine that grinding very harsh jet guitar tone but not so much focused on drawing up these super rhythmically dense riffs that basically are just masturbatory and boring anyway now much of the time loath tends to take the edge off of these heavier sections with these smooth soaring alt-rock passages which basically sound like something off of a Deftones album I get the attraction I mean Deftones are easily one of the most popular enjoyable unique and consequential rock bands of the past 20 years but why you'd want their influence to show up in your music in a way that is so on the nose I'm not sure I mean it's actually distracting how derivative it is now keep in mind the band's performances and execution during these sections is not terrible I suppose it's just sort of missing something like a unique approach because this is a lot of time on your record to be devoting to a sound that is just like a carbon copy of another band a very popular band mind you like pretty much the entirety of the track to a mirror or is it really you even the long ass at cartoon which is maybe the most glaring ripoff on the entire LP even if the slightly heavier guitars on this track sort of breathe new life into the sound it feels like I'm listening to Chino sing on top of like a torch instrumental or something much of the song screaming as well sounds like some very metallic art rock with some pretty righteous riffs there are portions of aggressive evolution that sound pretty Deftones inspired as well new faces in the dark too though I do think this track has one of the more unique song structures on the record I love these dramatically screen passages the way they transition into this dark ambient section and the very heavy riffey noise filled finale the song finishes off with while I understand the way forward for a lot of bands of this stripe is to be as versatile as possible it's part of the reason I love groups like Code Orange if you're going to brings on Rah's together as far separated as sludgy noise core in alternative rock like at least throw some other sounds in there to break it up so the combination isn't so repetitive and obvious granted loathe does do their best to break up the tracklist of this thing with cool interludes and there's even a cut here the song heavy is the head that falls with the weight of a thousand thoughts that opens with a pretty heavy atmospheric black metal intro there's also the closer which is a pretty epic finish to the album and features multiple phases is very dynamic and then crushing overall there's nothing really terrible about this record I just wish stylistically it had more going on for it in terms of just change ups and a variety of influences it's pulling from instead of just a handful of really obvious ones and combining them in a very simple and basic way there are also some tracks that are just straight ragers to like the cut gourd or even broken vision rhythm two of my favorites in the entire record I mean the mix and the riffs on these tracks is impeccably heavy and the performances are savage as fuck but still I would hate for the band to completely abandon this idea of changing their sound up and being a bit of a musical chameleon of sorts I guess in the future I'm just looking for a more exciting combination of the various influences the the puts into their sound and maybe just a less obvious spin on the groups that clearly inspire you because you know even the most derivative songs in the tracklist here do have some presentable ideas some decent writing good performances and a decent sound they just need a little something to push them over the edge so overall I thought this was a decent record a good flow great heavy crisp production some heavy hitters here and there in the tracklist I suppose you could say I feel the band has a lot of potential at this point despite that's not being one of my top top top rock records of the year I'm feeling a strong six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it

oH2rxEXcBSA,mm-hmm-hmm hi everyone Hanina here the internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new us girls album heavy-light us girls is the musical project of singer-songwriter megan remi as us girls she has been dropping low 5 psychedelic hypnagogic artsy heat for years I wasn't really blown away by the bulk of her material dropped in the 2010s however she really hit upon something in 2018 with her record in a poem unlimited in a poem features sharp social commentary set to everything from disco to funk to psych pop to alternative dance Remi essentially showed on this record that you could maintain a singular voice and message while embarking on all of these different genre based adventures a real shape-shifting series of musical styles that were some of Megan's most well produced and arranged songs yet so going into this new LP I was kind of hoping that Megan would find a way to push what she did on poem unlimited even further though admittedly I was mostly expecting for her to level out into an album that was equally as good if only because teasers like over time and for American dollars sort of sounded like tracks that could have slipped into poem unlimited but after listening to heavy light I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed that this album ended up being one of those records where only the singles end up being the best tracks creating a series of lulls through the tracklist the album never truly recovers from in many respects I found heavy-light to be an admirable and a passionate effort the social commentary is obviously still here and remy did take some risks on writing some tracks that were sort of melodramatic slow-burning but in my opinion many of these tracks don't really pan out that and the very disorienting vocal interludes on the record where you have numerous voices rambling over each other about different life experiences it doesn't really create a great flow for the record again overall it's a less gratifying listen than poem unlimited even if it does have a strong start with four American dollars which is a very fun disco inspired jam with soaring vocals and a classic groove the soulful singing on the track delivers clever lyrics about a lot of things what people will do for money advancing toward a cashless society bootstraps isms and not being able to pull yourself up by your bootstraps if you have no boots the track also features a very long but solid outro of group vocals getting thicker and thicker and thicker calling out different coins and cash denominations with all of this increasingly funky backing instrumentation meanwhile over time is a dramatic soul throwback its instrumental sounds more like something you would expect out of a Sharon Jones song but vocally Remmy decides to take things in a much more forlorn direction on the surface it would seem like Remmy is singing about some kind of addiction or alcoholism but once you dig further into the lyrics and also maybe take note of the songs music video it's pretty clear that she might also be singing about people who are overworked burnt-out loved the grooves and the instrumental palate of the song also the track features a very cacophonous ending with more and more instrumental layers building building building what's not to like but in my opinion past this point is where the record really begins to lose momentum the track IOU is a glamorous and slow piano ballad but I found the tune on this one to be really indirect in the pacing to be kind of tedious while I do think a cool down moment in the tracklist at this point would be appropriate this one is sort of a dud and while statehouse kicks off with one of those classic girl-group drum beats kick kick kick Tamm a song going in this direction at this point could be pretty cool but it's not so much a song as much as it's a weird vocal motif I guess I like the instrumental I like the group vocals and I like the messaging of the song but it's not so much a song it's just sort of an underdeveloped idea that boughs out prematurely so at this point I'm wondering how long in this tracklist are we going to wait until we actually get to something a bit more meaty the following born to lose is yet another slow burner in the tracklist here granted it's more engaging than I owe you but the flow of this record is on life support at this point and the random jazzy dissonant vibraphone Solo in the middle of this tract is like pulling the plug essentially ultimately while I do like the tracks chanted vocals and very low-key rhythm section all in all it sounds like something that if it had landed on the past couple of PJ Harvey records she would have done it more justice there then we have the track and yet it moves which is honestly the first exciting moment in the tracklist since the first couple of songs with this track we suddenly see the record moved into a very sensual kooky left-field piece of Latin pop we have shimmering synths great Greaves group vocals a message I can get down with as well essentially about society having choices put in front of it and hopefully justice and a better a better world advancing moving forward Denise don't wait is one of the more dramatic ballads here with lots of theatrical touches of percussion triangle timpani the vocals and chords make for yet another moment on this record that's essentially a nod to those classic girl group sounds but they are touched up and arranged in such a way where they sound a bit more abstract showy ornate I will say even though this isn't one of these strongest songs here I do like the build of instrumentation and vocals so it's it's kind of a win but sadly after this point we are led into a very weak third leg for this record Woodstock 99 is yet another underwhelming ballad the quiver to the bomb is a very glam e and dreamy piano back tune that leads up to a lush array of vocals and guitars in the second half that suddenly transitions into some surprisingly prog ease synth passages it's a very strange mix of influences that somehow works my main issue with the track is this incredible build of instrumentation doesn't really pay off in anything at the end in fact the song just ends up fizzling out fading out into basically the the most thankless closure of an album I've heard this year that would be the track red Ford radio which mostly features Remmy awkwardly emoting over a very dusty lo-fi distant drumbeat the whole track progressively gets more and more thick and heavy as it goes along but honestly the whole thing just sounds like a rough draft of something it's really anticlimactic even for a record that up until this point had very little in the way of direction to begin with look there are some very good ideas and even songs at various points of this tracklist but this is not a well-groomed or well developed album by any means certainly not as well assembled who are fulfilling as poem unlimited or even half free which while I'm not crazy about that record aesthetically it's way more consistent and is a much more focused album overall so while again there are a lot of things about heavy light that I do admire this record is really really really missing something feeling a strong five to a light six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my

sYLTNvie3sA,hi everyone cool - Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new lil Uzi vert project eternal a take Philly rapper and singer little Aussie vert finally coming through with one of the most highly anticipated rap albums of the past several years and even though up until this point I've never been a huge Izzy fan this is still a project I've been pretty excited for as some of the teasers have been pretty good though the two latest and biggest ones just ended up on this thing as bonus tracks and throughout his career woozi has been nothing if not chock-full of potential I mean EXO tour life is easily one of the best trap songs of the past decade and if Izzy could somehow manage to drop a full project of songs that great I mean we're talking about a game-changer then there were the nods to space travel as well as the Heaven's Gate cult and the promotional lead-up to this record which had me wondering if we were going to be in for something conceptual maybe something really out there but after finally hearing a ternal it take I can easily say this thing did not really live up to expectations and I think I can also say with no reservations whatsoever that Uzi is one of the most overhyped rappers of this past decade what is Uzi doing at this point with his music that no other artist is doing as of right now or doing better I feel like four years ago you could at least make the argument that Uzi was a strong contender in this burgeoning lane of Auto crooners but that sound and style has been pushed to the point where a project like little Uzi vs. the world is no longer cutting edge for example young thug is always developing and saying new vocal inflections Travis's music with each new project becomes more multi-phased and psychedelic and then you have figures like playboy cardi who have displayed how weird and minimal an artist can go while still maintaining mainstream credibility meanwhile it's been three whole years since Suzie's last full-length project and we have literally nothing to show for it in terms of artistic progression as he is delivering to us the same tiny voice buried in the mix the same references to designers diamonds watches this little bitch that little bitch this little bitch that little bitch the same sort of auto-tune the same triplet flows the same repetitive refrains and of course Suzie is singing all over this record too but whenever he does manage to bust out a good vocal line he doesn't structure it into a song that's all that catchy or enjoyable so he either repeats something ad nauseam to the point where it loses its flavor or it just ends up blending in with everything else and doesn't really I don't know hold that much significance most of the time it just seems like ooze E is riffing all over this record riffing vocally riffing topically which is a pretty massive disappointment for this record not only because we waited three years for this but also there's so much about this LP that is trying to tell the listener they're listening to something deeper then this actually is whether it be the colorful alien ship cover the slightly more atmospheric and experimental production as there are a few beats here that are laced with these really odd vocal samples or are maybe a little industrially tinged and then there are all of these inter song skits where Suzy is maybe on some sort of intergalactic journey he wasn't planning on he's reacting very generically to all of these sound effects happening around him like what what says what's going on where am i huh I guess there's at least a progression to it as toward the end hoozy gets on the phone and is talking about oh man I'd this crazy thing happened I got to put out my album it's a very weird story because you you can't really glean a whole lot from just listening to what is happening in the moment as izzy is just like reacting like an npc with like very generic scripted text to all of these occurrences like the he doesn't really go into detail with much so you have all these characteristics that build this record up to make it seem like it's something bigger than what it actually is and what it actually is is a middle-of-the-road trap album with very average rapping and production and that's it I will say the beats are maybe the best thing this album has going for it as they are somewhat varied I like these a nice sound effects and synthesizers that are laced into each instrumental here but God the drums are so damn thin and cheap all over this thing and they're sequenced into the most generic rhythms imaginable like really trap 101 and the mixing on many of these beats too kind of sucks whether it's chrome heart tags where the high hats are like barely there they're they're so faint and so quiet why did you even bother so while the beats are fine they're not so fired they carry the entire record the only hope of elevating them any further is a really great vocal performance from uzice but again he's not really doing anything he wasn't already doing three years ago and the result of that is the strained and nasally tone he puts on each track it gets old before the record is even over I'm sorry but Ozzy's voice and delivery is still at this point very one-dimensional and still has little to no presence the the the very low mixes his voice receives on many of these tracks aren't doing him any favors either I will give it to easy that every once in a while he will hit upon a very weird inflection on a line or a refrain I just went above my rights I just went up a price I just went up in my price but it's nothing so unique or mind-blowing that it brings the record up to another level and like I said earlier while sometimes the singing on this thing does hit there are just as many moments on this thing vocally that are embarrassing like when Susie is trying to harmonize with Sid which happens on the track urgency and when those two voices come together it is hideous now again looking at the title of this project along with the space skits and a line off of the track Venetia where Ozzy says that he's from outer space again you would think there's some kind of deeper space tied concept going on here but just reading into Izzy's lyrics more deeply it just kind of reads like any other trap wrapper which is kind of a shock because I found it difficult to find anything on this record that really felt like it was coming from an introspective or a personal place for Izzy I mean there is the track I'm sorry which arguably is one of the more emotional cuts here but the message of this one essentially boils down to I'm sorry I treated you like shit and I can't fuck with my fans because it's too much drama I guess it isn't really a grand display of emotion I mean it's it's barely even an apology even guys like little babies seem to be coming from a personal and an emotional place at least some of the time I wonder if I might actually get some more personal perspective from an NB a young boy mixtape at this point because meanwhile we have boozy recycling the same references to pattex and kitties again and again and again and again and that's it while also peppering in Corning Lines about having an Irish girl and feeling lucky I mean there are moments on this LP where I genuinely wonder if Ozzy is trying like on the track pop where many times his flow devolves into just repeated words that lose track of the tempo of the song and just sound like trash look if you want any hope of enjoying this thing maybe you should just avoid the lyrical content altogether because while flexing and materialism are not inherently bad things Busey doesn't really bring much to the table in terms of wordplay or charisma wit so I guess you could maybe just enjoy this LP more from an aesthetic perspective but once more in my opinion the flows the vocal lines as well as the beats only go so far now to top the whole record off we have the song p2 which essentially is an EXO tour life redo why are we doing this why is this a thing why are we this hung up on our best song that is three years old at this point if you want another song this good right another melody structure it out you are not gonna hit with another track this good bye just biessing your way through your new record I will say overall I do think eternal a take is better than love is rage - I think goosies performances are a bit better I think aesthetically it's more consistent I think that the production is better as well the flow of the record is good - but eternal it take still suffers from a lot of the same problems because once more Izzi isn't really doing anything here he hasn't been doing for the past four years as much as he would like you to think otherwise I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're

give it a shot and proceeds go to a good cause alright let's get into the worst tracks of the week we have a few we have a few a good handful one BAM this is a track from saving grace which is apparently a band that has been formed by legendary singer Robert Plant and everybody's song is the performance that I'm putting you guys on to over here it's a low cover which I mean I'm happy and for lo it I mean it's incredibly flattering for Robert Plant to want to cover one of your songs if you're a band of any stripe honestly don't don't think he'll be covering a you know a Greta Van Fleet song anytime soon though but you know still having said that this this is a very tedious and the instrumentation just sounds so flat so dry the vocal performances are weak just everything about this rendition of this low seong just kind of is just tripped up and unflattering you know I mean if you like it you like it I can't say I do though moving out from their devotion 1999 which is a music project that has just dropped a new EP via PC music been pretty excited about it and maybe there are deeper cuts on this EP that I think might be better but this this new track over here that is teasing toward the release of this thing devotion is just a very bland pastiche II bit of synth pop it's really hard to tell what exactly the band is going for here it just sounds like very nostalgic elevator music I guess can't really get much out of it frankly but again I still do want to try this EP and maybe there'll be more to it that has a bit more interesting we also have muzz which is apparently a new band that is fronted by none other than Paul banks of Interpol Fame and this track over here bad feeling is incredibly tedious I don't really know what to say outside of this is gonna be a pretty weak side project over here if all the tracks pan out like this because this is drab the ending is somewhat dramatic but there is nothing up until that point that really kind of makes the payoff worth is so and finally a new track from the band elder embers new record on the way as well and I cannot say I am into this new track I mean I enjoy a lot of the heavier sludgy ER stuff that elder has put out in the past and while progressive rock has always remained a bit of an influence on most of what they do this this track over here while there are some decent guitar licks here and there is just a very badly weakly sung drawn-out just bloated progressive rock song and that's it there's really nothing much more else to it hoping for a punch here heavier elder at some point in the future but it is it is not this track let's move into the tracks that I thought were just okay still wanted to shout them out but not blow me away or anything first off this new track from woods where do you go when you dream not as much of a funk element to this track I do tend to like the space ear full gear more rustic side of woods but hey the pianos and vocals on this track are cool and I like the lyrical the the topical focus of the song as well even if it's not one of the most memorable Tunes woods has ever recorded so moving on from there a track from Wilma Archer a UK artist last sniff is the name of this track and it features MF DOOM I think that the doom appearance is okay and I like the weird samples and instrumental bits throughout the beat it's it's very odd combination I just don't think they come together all that well and in a way that's really exciting it just kind of fails on the pacing end of things it's like I'm listening to a rough sketch of an idea as opposed to something that comes together in a very exciting way but but hey you know the this track has my interest piqued and and maybe this will have more impact in a greater tracklist or something so again name of this track over here is last sniff a lot of MF DOOM fans out there give it a try give it a shot the beats pretty out there and maybe that'll be enough to win some other people over moving on from their Katy Perry looking like she's an extra off of the midsummer set on her new single over here never worn white I mean it's it's a pretty focused ballad you know I've never worn white obviously about obviously it's a love song obviously it's a song about taking that nest next step making that commitment that sort of thing I just don't really care for Katy's vocals over this very very overdone melodramatic piano instrumental it's just not really where I think her voice works best and it it's just kind of an underwhelming tune overall but you know I suppose she is trying to sell it as hard as she possibly can and I guess it's a welcome change of pace from some of the stuff she's been doing lately if you want to hear something a bit more intimate introspective you know that sort of thing not so much the dance pop or you know the anthemic jams that were used to from Katy Perry so I'm not crazy about this direction but I guess it's cool to see that she's changing it up a little bit and maybe some fans out there were really kind of relate to the themes and the story of the track we have also out there a new single a new track from the thrash metal band havoc phantom force I don't think this is one of the Bands more memorable tracks but I do appreciate they are going hard as hell on this cut almost as hard as like the speed and the aggression that you would get out of like a vector song you know there are a lot of havoc tracks that sound you know very Megadeth ish and tend to play at that same level of intensity but they are like really kind of upping the ante a little bit on this track with the explosivity I guess you could say again I think that some of the riffs and again generally the song sort of loses translation in the chaos of the way they're playing and the way the song is paced but you know it's it's pretty interesting that they're moving in this direction shout out to Ambrose of give me another chance which is a very cerebral dance tune I think the chorus on this one could have popped a little bit more but again it's a pretty cerebral pretty surreal track very heady groovy tune essentially you know I mean it kind of lives up to the title - thematically give me another chance what it's about it's pretty on the nose and we also have a new track from cupcake over here a banger by the name of Jesus it's been a while we've heard from from cupcake the last time she was on social media she was telling us basically that she was like getting off of social media and and said that she was like corrupting the youth of their music and she wasn't gonna be coming out that anymore music and and and frankly at the time while I wanted her to do what was best for her and whatever made her happy I'm glad that she is sticking to it this is not like one of the best songs she's ever put out I mean there's not really too much in terms of like a strong hook or whatever however there is an incredible performance on this track and there are some very raw bars as well so maybe this is cupcake basically kicking the door back down and saying yeah I'm here I'm back I'm on top of an instrumental that sounds like something that a Blueface or block boy JB would be on top of so you know it's that very raw piano simple be that sort of thing so it's not bad it's not bad and here we have the best tracks the tracks this week that stopped me in my tracks and are really left an impression hope you guys like these songs too I will be looking forward to what these artists are doing in the near future based on how good the music is in this section so let's go first we have tops a music project that I'm just learning about not too long ago and this song over here that I'm trying to point in your direction I feel alive is a very bold piece of jangly pop with a passionate lead vocal and a great chorus give it to try give it a shot we have also a new track from Rena saw a Yama she is coming through with more sounds that are very much in that vein very much in the spirit of 2000's diva pop with quality production and some weird subversive elements being thrown in here and there too like the crazy heavy distorted heavy metal riff breakdowns that pop in between the verses on this thing again good production good performance Rina continues to kill it we have also any track from porches patients which is a passionate little piece of art pop and synth pop diggin it liking it diggin it it's very moody the instrumental is heavily heavily heavily textured porches last project in my opinion wasn't like amazing but the teasers that I've been hearing in this new album cycle had been very good so really for this new one I am nothing but excited we also have a track over here from an EP that dropped last year so this is not like a brand new new new new new new track but phone going off over here what the hell but still not a new new new track but this canadian artist who goes by the name pleasure craft work it out featuring ming jia it's a great post-punk tune with whaling surreal weird frightening tones just screaming in the background great beat bold lead vocal some chirpy awesome background vocals as well on the track which I imagine are the feature obviously but yeah it's a great song overall and looking forward to more music from this artist it is truly truly truly very good especially for someone like me who is a bit of a post-punk addict we have over here a new track from the dub from Natalia la vaca de Veracruz it's a beautiful tune Natalia's music is sounding more lush and instrumentally dense than ever it's it's it's a little heavily arranged much more range than anything that was like on muses Volume one and two but the vocals are still amazing the fantastic mix of Latin pop and folk and Mexican folk music as well comes through very well yeah just great tune great song great production good balance of the arranged instrumentation the bass instrumentation the vocals just eleven eleven eleven also it you know obviously it's a cover as she does tend to I do what she can and her music to tribute older artists and songs and these genres so you know give it a try give it a shot it's wonderful it's amazing it is touching to the heart we have also over here an artist who hails from Colombia her forthcoming record is titled miss Colombia and this song that I want to point in your direction is a wonderful track titled nada the artist is Leto pimienta and the artist to his feature on this track is li salmet i hope i'm pronouncing that correctly but this is a great great great piece of art pop but with all these wonderful latin elements woven in great beat wonderful vocal performance amazing vibe and aura off this track it's really got everything from songwriting to production to performance it's beautiful it's inspiring it's amazing and frankly has me excited for what will surely be over the course of the next few decades a much more international you know sense of of what is going on in all corners of the music world I think the internet you know kind of the next step for music consumption is that it's going to make it so much easier for artists who come from outside of US borders to to break it in to the u.s. music market and especially if the music is this good like goddamn it's gonna be amazing it's gonna be a wonderful new era alright moving on from there we have a new track from the lemon twigs so I've never really been a big fan of up until this point I found a lot of their stuff previously to be a little mediocre however this new song over here titled the one is a quality quality quality piece of glam rock with good vocals classic somewhat rough production and a solid chorus as well you know I will say it's it is a little derivative it's not the most original thing you're going to hear in this genre of course but it is still very good it's still really fricking good can't - I can't really deny that so I give it a try give it a shot we have a song from Jarvis cockers new band jarv is keep in mind Jarvis Cocker is of pulp fame and while I've never really been a big fan of his solo stuff this new song from this new ish project if you call it a project a band it's it's sort of strange that he's gone from coming out with stuff that's just titled after him to a project named jarv is but hey you know whatever I mean I can at least say uh musically it sounds a little different to me it sounds a little more lush and a little more surreal little odd so Jarvis house music all night long really groovy track lush track sensual in a way as well and kind of a song he'd really kind of soak into you know like a hot bath filled with trippy colors and you know some strong song writing on it as well so give it a try over here we had another track from a rapper I believe I talked about in the last weekly track roundup video Jah med Jeep is the name of this new song and single that he has dropped and while I don't love it as much as the last tract I do think there are some great little you know flows and catchy little lines Jeep Jeep now lay in it a keep keep that I think are pretty cool I think the vocals are maybe a little too buried in the beat on this one but there's still too many good ideas for me to not enjoy this track and not be excited for what this guy is coming down the pipe next we have Igor which is a musical project that has always perplexed me in terms of its strange fusions of metal and electronic music this new track over here very noise is an intense blend of like riffs and break beats and it's an amazing series of progressions very exciting very on the edge of your seats and very few artists out there like kind of fusing these sounds as well as Igor continues to do even if there are some people who continue to be turned off you know by this mix of sounds as it is it does continue to be a bit unorthodox and and still even when I do enjoy it is kind of embracive and strange but the this this track is insane do not miss it do not miss it we have also over here a new track from Heron Emory and she is killing it on the song titled riot which is a pretty special in a few senses I mean easily one of the more instrumentally dense tracks I mean more instrumentally dense than many songs off her last record and and also one of the most frantic lyrical performances of like any Haru song that she's done so far which in a way does make the track a little difficult to digest at first but it comes to a a wonderful resolution toward the end and it's a great progression great choruses just might take you a few lessons to get acclimated as it is a pretty intense song it is a pretty intense track we have a new track from the high end sisters which is is pretty surprising considering how so-so their last record was the steps is the name of this new track over here and it's it's really a big change of pace sonically and stylistically as I mean the the song of the tune is great which I mean look the high end sisters know their way a good song just kind of a matter of delivery a lot of the time and now with this track over here while I'm not super crazy about how dull the sounds are a little bit it's more of a classic rock sound you know it's just got a very classic dusty set of guitars and bass and drums and vocal harmonies it just sounds like I don't know decades-old I just can't really describe sort of the the era exactly that it's coming from maybe 60s or 70s it's a little vague in that sense it seems like it's referencing a time that is you feel like is in the past but you can't quite pinpoint to accurately but still either way it's got me pretty excited for their new LP that hey maybe they might try to do something a bit more vintage that is maybe not amazing but at least better than something that's a very moderate and typical I guess so also over here we have gas lighter new track from the Dixie Chicks didn't think a year ago I'd be here telling you guys the new Dixie Chicks single is amazing but it's actually like really fucking good country pop with great vocal harmonies great lyrical and a topical focus a good production - as sure it's very clean it's very methodically arranged but also there is kind of an element of rawness to the singing and the guitars on this track - so yeah I mean I like it I like it quite a bit and I think I think the song concept is is sharp - it's a very in-your-face it's very straightforward it's very gutsy liking it liking it we also have over here and you track from the chromatics it's a very cinematic piece of Spacey spoken word pop I guess you could say I've never been a huge chromatic sky in the past but I can at least say this song did wow me a little bit you know it's a mood it's definitely a mood and we have over here another track from Caroline Rose which is a wowing me a little bit despite having never really been a huge fan of her stuff in the past but do you think will last forever is a very eccentric cheeky and somewhat strange piece of synthesizer pop give it a try give it a shot I'm not going to say too much more about it as I may talk about her new record here super started in some capacity in the near future so and also Brock Hampton has come out with an awesome new remix of the song sugar which is one of my favorite tracks off of their last record obviously Rian Beatty is on the track and we have do a leap on the track and John B as well listen to it it's great remix and also Bri runway shout out to Bri runway eight shit new single Bri runway the sounding like you know I got a really frickin classic Missy Elliott type figure on this track obviously the production and there are a lot of elements of the song that are very modern but also futuristic too but I will say above all else there's a huge just like the this thing is soaked it's dripping in a big Missy Elliott influence in a good way you know it's like I feel like there are some artists of the past that if you're looking to come through with this blend of hip-hop and R&B and pop music the one artist that you want to take some notes from is Missy and I feel like Bri is doing that in a very creative way on this new track over here it's a banger it's a banger multiple phases lots of different sounds and styles and genres flowing through this one give it a listen and also ash Nikko over here comes through with another pop trap fusion banger tantrum is the name of this one and it goes a lot harder than some of the stuff she's been doing as of late the production is pretty explosive and I like that she's a drifting a little bit away from a lot of the more I hate you I'm trying to forget you or I'm mad at you our relationship didn't work out type of topics that a lot of her stuff up until this point has just been orbiting around and orbiting around an orbiting around again I like that she's doing something a bit more self affirming and just really kind of going hard on this one so so again tantrum is the name of this new track over here and it's a pretty good it's pretty good and that is going to be it for weekly track roundup thank you very much for checking out this video and hopefully you get some good recommendations here remember everything I talked about is linked down below shout out once more to a turntable lab our patreon link and of course good people over at the ridge again those links are all down below and I will catch you guys in the next one Anthony Fantana weekly tract roundup forever 
jR3hyPi0Dbc,
cVCZGlcW3lA,oh yeah hi everyone revenue Rhonda here the internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for a review of the new bad bunny record yaaah goal okay made Bela gana this is the latest LP from Puerto Rico's own bad bunny it's the man's second studio album finally following up his debut that dropped in 2018 coming right after the levee break on the massive wave of Latin trap that has been dominating since the late 2010 I will say though I don't think his debut LP was him putting his best artistic foot forward lots of very formulaic trap beats on this one with a slight Latin twist topped by bad bunnies awkward bellowing voice which all made for a very one-dimensional listen not only that but the sound of the cell pee kind of melted into the Greater American trap landscape which is kind of disappointing for a record that has such a a far reaching international appeal so given how much room for improvement there was on por siempre I went into yo hago hoping for anything to be better really just anything even though trap music still has a pretty significant influence on the 20 tracks here bad bunny does a pretty nice refrain leaning much more on reggaeton than he did on his last record which may be a bit of a reach for some American listeners but it's not like the genre hasn't had waves of popularity over here before and Plus on many of these tracks bad bunny does for reggaeton what artists like Travis Scott or future have done for trap meaning there's more of an emphasis on sound and texture vibe some tracks or subtly psychedelic - whether you're talking about the track led difficile which features a lot of shimmering reverb around the track since a great chorus melody - and then there's the dramatic piano chords and ethereal synth leads on the daddy yankee aided la santé which i don't really care for how yankees vocals overtake the track there's so much louder than bunnies i won't deny though they do have complimentary styles and his performance is pretty bold bad bunny and on well a later on the record seemed like a better match though there's also the really thick heavenly layers of synthesizer on so Leah and so the very stark and hard-hitting combination of drums and loud squawking since ano PRA Isola we also get some very ghostly dystopian throbbing synthesizers on bitchy all which honestly sound like a horror movie The Click Clack percussion the guns going off in the track - its it's like a combination of reggaeton and horrorcore now lyrically the track doesn't quite go that far but there are some allusions to darker ideas and themes here - so it does at least fit with the theme and the sound of the music meanwhile the trap flavoured cuts on this record aren't nearly as shy with their Latin influences as they were on por siempre whether it's a blameless manana with its sticky woodwind melodies and very warm bassline surprisingly there's an emo ish guitar breakdown in the second half which eventually leads us to an epic rock inspired finish the flows throughout the song are really good - there's also the intro track whose trap beat is back with these cutesy little keyboard licks that sound like I'm listening to Latin elevator jazz it's very fun it's very playful sets kind of a random unpredictable mood of the tracklist overall and certainly fits the title of the album - which essentially translates to I do what I want and this is very I'm going to do whatever I want to do type of record take the absolute multiplicity of sounds styles voices and aesthetics going into Safa era which is essentially like the sicko mode of reggaeton there's even a very bold plucky synth melody in the second-leg that sounds like it's a take on the same synth lick on Missy Elliott's get your freak on and dare I say the singing on this record has gotten a bit better - it's more dynamic it's more authoritative the processing seems to have eased up a little bit though much of the time that bunny is still like gasping for breath in between bars which I still find pretty off-putting but seriously here bad bunny is sounding more like a singer and less like a foghorn now there are a few more enjoyable outliers and surprises in the tracklist namely the reggae infused - Merce aid also the pretty intimate guitar number at the very end that sees bad bunny essentially thanking his fans for bringing him where he is and sticking with him since the beginning but despite the noticeable improvements there are on this record I do have some issues namely with tracks on the tracklist that work with pretty much the same underwhelming formula that numerous duds of por siempre did I don't deny the vocals the production in the mixing on vitae or la zona or Kamala or all better than many tracks off of siempre but they're still pretty much reverb soaked generic trap and reggaeton without much in the way of any variation tunes that just don't stand out that strongly either if this is a direction you have to go in like take your two or three best songs in this vein and leave it at that meanwhile the track ignorant ace sounds like a hit in the worst possible way it's melodramatic glassy atmospheric as hell overly sentimental I feel like I'm just listening to a bunch of American pop cliches play out but with a different language and a different beat however there's not much more on this album that's more ill-conceived than some of the refrains on P R so yeah there are a chunk of tracks on this record that I wouldn't necessarily go as far as to call filler they don't quite sound that low effort but they are working with a very tiresome and redundant formula that ends up making the tracklist sound very one-dimensional in some respects overall they like this bad bunny record quite a bit there's a lot to celebrate in terms of the vocals the production the versatile array of ways that revises Latin trap and reggaeton definitely a marked improvement over the last record if only it were boiled down to its best tracks though still what I will say is the future of Latin trap and reggaeton is here and bad bunny is helping to bring us there feeling a light two DS and seven on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video for to check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantan Oh bad bunny forever 
7aA6NOJtjew,promise I'll quit this game hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new caribou album suddenly this is the latest LP from singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist producer daniel snake AKA daphne AKA manitoba AKA caribou this is his fifth commercial album under the caribou name his first in six years since 2014's our love was his last album the somewhat of a weaker release for daniel as his usual brand of indie tronic pop with a psychedelic and danceable twist came together in a somewhat bland way on this one basically went into this album hoping for a stronger showing and the teasers certainly pointed to that and i'm happy to report that suddenly is actually one of daniel's more versatile records quite a few stylistic risks taken on this one a lot of them pan out even going as far as to work in some ideas that are clearly hip-hop inspired but of course he puts his own spin on these sounds and doesn't drift too far from his trademark palette of synthetic serene danceable arthur russell isms so suddenly is a 12 track 43 minute release relatively tight listen the opener makes for a very beautiful and stark intro to the entire record with daniel singing youthfully and shyly over these very gentle subtly wailing synthesizer layers they just feel really alien and smooth somewhat icy and lyrically the song sets the record up for a lot of its most key themes love family change growing pains essentially the following track you and i sees Snaith quickly transition into some moody synth pop with a crisp drum beat throbbing chords and more icy glistening leads vocally daniel is sounding pretty boyish pretty gentle not the strongest singing you're gonna hear this year however it is well placed within the instrumental pretty spotlit so it pops out very dramatically what's also great are the funky sample laced breakdowns in between verses especially the second one where Dan seems to work in some trap high hats and does it pretty seamlessly without changing the overall vibe of the track just another dynamic another flavor the track Sunny's time is another moment where we get a subtle hip-hop nod a bulk of the instrumental is made up with these woozy piano samples persistent kicks swelling sacks layers but Dan then tops all of this with these bold auto-tuned and very forceful cycled almost wrapped vocal leads that are sort of moving through these repeated rhyming mantras I go through rounds I gots to balance I guess the bounce it's a really cool clash of ideas but still manages to be one of the more underwhelming tracks here as it fizzles out pretty much out of nowhere kind of wish Daniel built this one out a bit more new Jade presents more pretty jittery sample laced electronics backed with a beat that grooves like another hip-hop variant Smith's vocals once again do sound a bit faint amongst these sparkling synth arpeggios and the vocal samples of in the past in the past I still do like the production and the progression and the energy of the song Dan's falsettos do ring alot more brightly on the hook and then home sees Snaith throwing some soul samples over a literal boom backbeat for a vibe that sounds frankly pretty classic and sentimental I could totally envision like a New York rat vet spinning bars about the good old days over this instrumental but what Dan does vocally on this track instead isn't that either his voice is spotlit lonely beautiful edited in very subtle ways that are kind of trippy easily one of the best tracks here the following cut limes seized and moving back into familiar territory with an instrumental that seems pretty much like a fusion of house and funk with some jazzy licks and embellishments thrown into the mix and while I like the idea of going in this direction generally there are so many ill-conceived sounds on this track I don't really care for like the very loud plucky overly processed guitar passages the weird bits of robotic vocals that seem weirdly out of tune with the rest of the instrumental then the track suddenly drops off into this very tribal beat and chant the song is just a mess no coherence no cohesion weird the best track on the record is bunched up right against the most senseless song on the record thankfully the song never come back goes back in a house direction and really brings it this time sure it goes but it's no Daft Punk and what I mean by that is that the beats and the very punchy piano chords and the vocals are presented all in a way that's very light on the ears very polite it's more like a dance party for headphones in the dance floor of your mind next like I love you is a piece of indie tronic pop with a lot of lyrics dealing in insecurity and self-doubt basically reflecting on a past lover and whether or not their new person is is as good as you is there as much love between them as there was between you and this person when you are together definitely one of the saddest and most direct Tunes on the album though I don't care too much for how dry the beat is meanwhile magpie is a sweet piece of synthetic and psychedelic balladry that feels like it could have come from a Bibby Oh album or it's maybe even a bit beatles inspired to think of the song blackbird for example but rather than making an acoustic number here dan decides to just back his very intimate voice with a lot of synth arpeggios a pretty low fight beat as well I love that on this track and with this sound palette daniel is able to create this incredible sense of intimacy meanwhile Ravi is a pretty straight piece of UK garage Daniel goes into this direction surprisingly and does the style a lot of justice there's not a lot of variations or I would say twists on the sound but it does bang it is one of the hardest going tracks on the entire record great beat great progressions really thick blissful euphoric ending finally cloud song not just the last track here but the longest - pretty much a very sparse new-agey piece of art pop though I would argue the first leg does drag on a little bit the conclusion in the second half is beautiful though and overall I got to say I liked this one I thought it was pretty good a good showing from Daniel and a great mix of sounds and styles all coming together into a pretty sad layered gentle little record with what seems like a lot of very personal and love centric lyrics the ending was a bit bolder and I will say my main issues with a lot of Dan's work do carry over onto this record a little bit in that so many of the vocals and some of the sounds and melodies are very faint to the point where they become a little forgettable or don't leave that strong of an impression in my opinion dan does have a tendency to trend towards sounds and textures that are a bit more mild than I typically like but still I thought this was a lot better than his last LP even with a few relative duds in the tracklist especially lined which is easily the most malformed song here overall feeling a light to decent seven on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is

DhTY9G4KdtE,hi everyone crank the NIEM and tanana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and this new little baby project it's not good lil baby is an Atlanta rapper singer songwriter this is his second solo full-length commercial album and admittedly I did not go into this LP with a lot of high hopes mostly because when he broke onto the scene in 2018 I thought his debut was pretty underwhelming his collaboration record with gonna that dropped that same year which was very popular I thought was even worse but it's still been a couple of years since that moment in time and I guess part of me hoped that little baby would have spent that time maturing artistically in some way shape or form and I just can't say that happened the many problems I have with this LP on individual tracks and more broadly applied to a range of characteristics the vocals and vocal performances the production the songwriting none of which on my turn I found to be enjoyable or even memorable let's start with the vocals and vocally I've always had an issue with little baby sound and style as it's not really a sound and a style many times he has been said to be just a young thug clone but I feel like going that far would imply that at least his range and talent level is within the realm of young thug's and it's really not just listen to the song on here where young thug is featured and it is a and a difference in terms of dynamics charisma intelligibility as little baby just is muttering his way through most of these tracks lil baby maybe does display a bit more vocal range on my turn but it's it's not much more than he's had in the past there are still many tracks here where he just sounds like a lesser version of young thug and then again there are moments where he sounds like he's pulling some inspiration from Wayne also from future as well specifically on a song here that features future where he spends the first leg of the track with a future inflection of future flows so by the time future features on the song the future feature the feature from future is pretty much pointless because you've spent the entire track thus far sounding like future form your future feature for former future features got so only looking at this record from a vocal standpoint little baby is not really any more impressive than he was a few years ago not anymore distinct still pretty one-dimensional one note not a whole lot of flows at little baby's disposal not a whole lot of range or inflection or character dude is really putting me to sleep half the time there are maybe a few tracks where you sounds a touch more animated but it's not a night and day difference and I will say the song consistent is maybe the one track here where vocally he sounds pretty raw pretty emotive lots of conviction in his voice but would would I buy into this before I do a better rapper or singer not necessarily and what's even worse is the auto-tune on little baby's voice for the majority of this LP now in general there's nothing wrong with auto-tune or vocal effects especially in this style of trap where a little can go a long way but little baby is already not that expressive of a singer and a rapper so when you throw that auto-tune on the more subtle and human qualities of his voice are just totally sucked out of the equation on top of it the way the auto-tune is applied and the way his voice is mixed on many of these tracks it just sounds really pitchy it's not pleasurable at all so while there are a few tracks on this record I found to be tolerable just vocally this thing is pretty much a non-starter and it's almost a non-starter on the instrumental front too I think there are maybe a handful of pretty good or impressive beats in this 20 song tracklist especially the intro track get ugly were baby himself in the lyrics refers to how good the beat is and it is a good instrumental so every once in a while on the instrumental side you do get an epic beat but a vast majority of the totally half-assed painfully plain beats on this thing follow a stupidly simple formula step one is grab a simple melodic loop off of an online sample library like splice com somewhere like that take that and basically do nothing with it outside of looping it make sure to mix it solo you barely hear it anyway so grabbing it in the first place was almost pointless but you can't have like no melody and no chords in the track so you got to throw something in there punctuated that sample with the thinnest snares and hi-hats ever heard in a trap song then sequenced them in the most generic patterns that you can without getting called out for doing the same exact thing over and over all that's left now is to throw in your kicks and your bass which of course you pump up so high the only place it's gonna sound good is on some laptop speakers of course you're also going to want the EQ on baby's voice to not be all that flattering so there is that and that's pretty much how a great deal of songs on this album come together finally there's the song writing on the record which isn't as terrible as much as it is just absent I mean there's not a whole lot in terms of structure or contrast or variation across these songs so don't expect anything in terms of like a big hook I mean the money bag yo featured track on this thing just kind of sounds like an endless course that never changes into anything else so very few of these songs actually pop with a nice nice chorus I do give a little baby some credit though because there are tracks here where he does focus pretty nicely lyrically on a central idea a lot of the time when little baby isn't flexing or just talking about some flashy shit he is trying to really bore into some genuine feelings of sadness tragedy loneliness I don't deny the emotion going into this LP is authentic and legitimate but given that little baby doesn't have the strongest voice and on top of it he's not the strongest lyricist either he's not a great conduit for it he doesn't exactly use relatability I would say when it comes to communicating and transmitting his emotions through his music little baby fails pretty handily as pretty much everything about him and my turn is so painfully below average and that's the thing I can't even say anything on this LP is like okay or decent it's just all so below average and little baby brings nothing to the table in terms of making up for that in any way not even a distinct style so even though it's still pretty early in the year I have listened to a lot more albums in 2020 than I've actually reviewed and still my turn is one of the most uninspired and mind-numbing listens I've thus far this little baby record it's not good 
jlokVOTEvDs,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another edition of the why you know review where I go over a bunch of Records that I haven't reviewed formally and I talk about them in a gauntlet like in this video one after the other that's what we do that's the why you know review so now that it's explained let's go babay I will admit despite not being a fan of tennis not really enjoying tennis music this new record is easily Tennessee's best record maybe most enjoyable record to me having said that I think even at this point with Tennessee's best album the songs are still pretty derivative and and really just make for very standard indie pop with some slightly refined instrumentation it's fine it's not terrible it's not quite as insipid as I've found their old stuff to be but still not something I would go out of my way to voluntarily listen to I think there are other artists in a similar vein that I much prefer so I don't know [Music] the new halls the album Believe It or Not is the best halsy album by at least a few miles her most versatile LP - as there are some trap and pop infused ballads and tunes on here there are some more alternative and rock bass tracks tracks that are more acoustic we have interludes and appearances from Dominic fyke and Suga BTS and Alanis Morissette I think Halsey does a really good job of putting her influences and putting everything that musically makes her tick on display with this record there are some songs actually quite a few songs that I think are duds and while it is a pretty versatile album it's still not a very risky album it's great that artists in the mainstream pop sphere are being given the ability to create and explore so freely this is the kind of pop record that I think 10 to 15 years ago you justyou just wouldn't have gotten this kind of album so so that is encouraging and I do like that but I think there need to be better tunes and there needs to be a more of an attempt to define what exactly makes Halsey hall C stylistically sonically which I think she's still kind of yet to do so I don't know while I think this record coming from her is there a personal record and I like that it is a diverse LP stylistically and sonically it could have gone further [Music] Hatari the Icelandic future pop in agro tech band that shocked Eurovision have come through with their debut album and if you are into screamed vocals in a foreign language with politically charged lyrics over I I guess aggressive techno beats give it a try be my guest I do think the group sound is not that dynamic though the record really starts running out of ideas at one point and I can't say I would necessarily go out of my way to listen to these instrumentals if you know they didn't have vocals I suppose what I'm trying to say ultimately is that there are elements of Hatari sound that I find to be just okay while I like generally the look and the aesthetic and the vibe and the radical and wild attitude that the group brings forward I think the music could be a bit you know more versatile more detailed and tribute this particular brand of future pop a bit better so at this point pretty cool lots of potential and maybe looking forward to a new record at some point that might hit a little bit harder [Music] this Russ record I could not get into not only is this one of the thinnest and most thankless sets of instrumentals on a Russ album so far but he continues to squander his talents for rapping with weak songs underwhelming verses he had a pretty impressive feature list going into this thing but people like Rick Ross were really phoning it the hell in I feel like I know what I'm going to get exactly like to a tee when I go into a Russ album at this point because he's not really trying anything new lyrically he's not really trying anything new instrumentally and as a result this record was just above all else boring while it's amazing that Russ does what he does as pretty much a lone wolf he left up to his own devices just plays it really really really safe we waited all this time for this album with messy instrumentals and songs that feel barely finished such a scant tracklist and weak performances Lari who can do so much better I just don't know how how did how did we get here it's killing me [Music] these suicide boys are back with a new project it is a shorty with huge huge huge huge huge Memphis vibes lots of trap beats big bass tight flows so some more melodic chorus is here and there in a few weird stylistic variations but nothing nearly is out there as that travis barker EP they did last year III would say this is suicide boys trying to get a little bit back to form give the fans more tracks and more songs that they're sort of used to hearing from them really kind of going back to their roots and all that which is not entirely a bad thing just kind of hitting the reset button doing what they're known best for and for the most part sounding pretty good in the process even though I'm not the biggest fan of kpop in the world I know well enough to know when I hear the best crop of Luna songs so far on this EP the production hits hard the instrumentals are pretty varied you have more modern bangers you have one track on here that feels almost like a an 80s throwback and it's it's a good set of tunes too and great vocal performances and it's not over produced like many tracks on the new BTS record where it's just high-energy good grooves catchy choruses good vocal arrangements it's it's a quality Luna project and you know anybody who is a little kpop curious give it a shot because just generally it is good pop music legendary post rock and screamo outfit envy are back with a new LP their first I think in five years it's been a little while and it's pretty good nothing crazy new or groundbreaking for envy but they are one of the most consistent post-rock or at least post rock adjacent bands out there really yet to put out a terrible record and this is just yet another example of the quality writing and good performances that go into pretty much every single LP now I will say the heavier tracks and more screamo oriented tracks are the best ones here some of the more mellow cuts do and too low for me but you know if if Envy's unique blend of screamo and post-rock or even if you're kind of curious to hear that sort of thing because it's not something a lot of bands have done or have been as successful doing as Envy just just give it a try give it a shot it's quality rock record you know I know emo and scream are very popular these days and envy has been around for decades and I feel like with a lot of current date emo fans not enough of them are quite appreciating envious contributions to the genre and what better place to start than a new record from the band that's actually pretty good [Music] the latest LP from destroyer really does break my heart in a way despite having been a big fan of Dan Behar's music for years and years and years these are some of Dan's weakest vocal passages and on top of that this is the most embarrassing wonky weirdly mixed and awkward sets of instrumentals to ever make it on to any destroyer album period like they don't really complement Dan's style at all they're jumping all over the place stylistically so there's no real cohesion to the record itself I just personally don't see the appeal of this one at all this really needed to not go out into the world not really into it unfortunately [Music] new record from this musical project known as Cindy Lee which is spearheaded by multi-instrumentalist singer-songwriter formerly of women Patrick flagel I know Cindy Lee has come out with stuff in the past though I haven't really gone too deep into it or covered it I will say this is one of the boldest and most well put together Cindy Lee projects so far though that is a tough thing to gauge because Cindy Lee tends to be a very out-there musical endeavor as there is very little consistency rhyme or reason to the flow of this record sure it's pretty noisy it's pretty hypnagogic at points too but it is difficult to make heads or tails of because a lot of the tracks here are just that odd it's a head scratcher I'll say that a new album from the Brock Hampton adjacent singer/songwriter Ryan Beatty while I have enjoyed Ryan's vocals on features here and there between this and his last record I'm just still in a place where I haven't quite yet heard vocal performances that convinced me Ryan can carry an entire record on his own while I have heard some stunning vocals from him and and hooks from him I'm just not hearing them on his own record personally especially this new one where the vocals are manipulated and processed in a variety of different ways across the tracklist to the point where the the album doesn't really have a singular character or direction or voice a lot of the vocals are manipulated and changed around to the point where I feel like the singing is kind of kneecapped and ruined and not all that pleasurable to listen to the the last LP at least seemed kind of consistent and knew the sound it wanted to generate in what direction I wanted to go in even if it was a little one-dimensional this LP by comparison is just very schizophrenic very all over the place very indecisive and that also shows up in the quality of the songwriting as well so I don't know just not really feeling this one a new massive album of lots of tracks from one of the biggest auto careers out there right now a boogie with the hoodie and yeah I can't say I'm into this one mostly because I think boogie boils this style and boils this trend down to its most poppy commercial elements and tries to make them even slicker than they are typically I personally don't really get it it just sounds like an endless advertisement to me it just it just sounds like an ad just sounds like I'm skipping through a bunch of YouTube pre-rolls the musical equivalent to that I suppose lot of bedroom pop enthusiasts freaking out about the new Zac Villere album was pretty curious about it myself after enjoying one of the teasers to it but now that I hear the the whole thing what why are the vocals so bad why is the singing this bad does the singing need to be this bad the vocal harmonies need to sound this awkward does the singing need to be this clumsy and goofy I don't get the appeal I don't know that's really all I have to say I can't hate on Zach's lyrical content or even the quality of some of the instrumentals on this thing but the vocals just seem way way way way way too amateurish with no real charm whatsoever I I can't really get much out of them personally [Music] best coast is back and it is more very low-grade indie rock and pop just as it has always been but hey if you are that type of person who this this has scratched some kind of itch for you I guess the upside is that best coast has not really changed all that much radically over the years so you know you you kind of you kind of know what you're getting the new Ozzy record is somewhat interesting one metal legend in his 70s at this point he has some fantastic solo lp's his work with Black Sabbath is so essential to the metal canon the man's influence in media across the board not just music is massive but I don't really feel like this new LP from him is all that flattering while the vocals do sound pretty good and I don't know how much they may or may not have been touched up but okely Ozzy still sounds pretty consistent you know and look this is a guy who vocally should have been sort of like waning in the 2000s and even back then he was sounding pretty good but a production wise I feel like this album is a mash of a lot of old rehashed tropes and some newer trends with some weak crunchy just overly heavy drums and guitar engineering it just sounds really horrid like it's it's not very complimentary to Ozzy's vocal tone and to the eras of music that his voice was so relevant to just kind of feels like a blown up and cheapened and overly heavy and distorted version of that I will say the Elton John duet is beautiful and I do think the opening track rocks pretty hard and there are some elements of the song with posts Malone that are pretty out there and fun even if the vocal processing makes as ease voice sound pretty hideous I think there are some respectable elements to this LP but it's not a very strong showing mostly because the songs and the production are fairly weak the new real-estate LP sounds sleepy as ever this band is still putting me to sleep some of the dreamiest and faintest songs vocals guitars drums everything in indie music I still don't get the appeal but hey I guess you can say real estate are still sticking to their guns their night-night lullaby good time go to bed guns while still at this point I would not call myself a nudie fan what I do admire about this new project is that the production the recording the flows on this one are a lot more raw and the performances are more animated nudie does not sound quite so out of his gourd and high to the point where he's nearly comatose on this he sounds just alive on this one he sounds Lively and I'm liking that energy I do think his flows are a bit messy but he does have a unique Twain to his voice that does make him stick out quite a bit so I don't know I think this one's okay it's a decent one it's decent it's decent ition have you given any of these albums a listen did you love him to jadam

Ebp8_eD7jM8,hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week you know what it is all the songs I talk about in this video are linked down below in the description box along with our turntable lab link where you can buy some awesome vinyl we get kicked back from it off that link and our patreon page is linked down below as well get access to some awesome monthly bonus content while supporting the channel and everything that we do in the process and look guys this is gonna be a big episode of the weekly track round if I have a lot of songs a lot of songs to go over I'm not gonna be able to give the most in-depth description on every single track but a lot of songs a lot of them are highly recommended and once more they are all linked down below so you can check them out for yourself I have a few shoutouts to give off the top here on behalf of Austin who is taking it upon himself to throw some recommendations into this segment we have one release over here which is linked down below from Henning at Christiansen this is an archival release of his work of two different a very evocative tape works from him arrest and peace and we also have one from Dean Roberts singer-songwriter in this record over here from him is according to Austin and impeccably produced piece of electro acoustic slow core give it a try give it a shot Austin has good taste I have faith in in in the man's ear it's very different than mine he usually enjoys more abstract works than I do and when he does pick out something that sticks out to him it's usually a pretty intriguing pretty intriguing stuff all right we're gonna get into the worst tracks this week we have got a handful first off we are going to do this noose Whaley track someone said which sway putting out material when he's not one half of race rumored is it's it's it's not very good it's boring it's one-dimensional it's four a generic trap with not much in the way of a hook or anything it's very repetitive - and soulless I'd really don't get the appeal of this it's a quite drab we also have a new track from Shabazz Palaces that is not all that great the production isn't even all that psychedelic or mind-bending at this point it's pretty plain meanwhile the guest vocals on here sound kind of goofy I mean I appreciate it for sounding like Shabazz Palaces is trying to update its sound a little bit make the project sound a bit more contemporary and with the times but I've always enjoyed Shabazz sounding unique sounding cutting-edge and this just does not feel that way to me at this point it just sounds a very trendy and simultaneously kind of dated - it's really lost on me honestly we also have the sleepiest band in Indy real estate coming through with a brand new track the main thing and yeah still sounding a pretty pretty sleepy here getting nothing out of it virtually nothing and we have Noel Gallagher's high flying birds with one of the most embarrassing songs to come out of the project because the hook on this one is awful come on outside it is a little blown out it's a little over produced it's a little overly heavy doesn't have much body to it and very under written as well so let's get into the tracks that I thought were kind of met wasn't really insane about these songs but still thought they were worth pointing out first off a track from a band by the name of Vonda bar montage music is the name of the song it's not a bit of a cool rock pop rock throwback with a new way of twist it's a little vintage not entirely original but it's still a pretty fun listen we have also this new track from Stephen Malkmus shadow band nightmare fuel nightmare fuel on the music video over here which seems to be based on some kind of filter that gives you a weird representation of noctis's face can't quite describe how unsettling it is but it is unsettling the song itself is kind of a twangy weird mystical acoustic cut with some lyrics that feel like they're a reflection on kind of the Information Age that were that we're living in I mean I don't think malkmus has done the most interesting update to his sound in a long long while or at least you know it in in comparison with other artists who are sort of cut from his cloth from his lane from his era but I will say I feel like he is trying to at least make it reflective of the era that he's writing and creating in and I like that we have also over here a track that I found over on the lyrical lemonade YouTube channel which I viously I'm not saying I discovered the artists here rod wave is the name of this dude thief in the night while I think the song itself is a little under written the instrumentals pretty solid and vocally he's really good he's a good vocalist I would love to hear him singing over some tracks that are a bit more robust and structured but are really liking this guy's voice I think as far as the auto crooners go though he died not didn't use a whole ton of auto-tune from what I noticed you know it's just a very good clean singer you know as far as dudes singing over trap beats go I would love to hear more from this guy just again a more robust stinky song I think would be totally necessary but this was sounding pretty good to me it was a vibe we also have over here a new track from none other than princess nokia who has just dropped not one but two about half-hour-long albums at once the track over here green eggs and ham is the teaser it's the opening track to this everything is beautiful album that she is again one of the two albums that she's just dropped and I think it's okay it's very chance the rapper ish it's very short there's some elements of it that I just wish there was more to but I am still very intrigued to listen to both of these two records from Nokia so reviewing both of them hopefully over the next week or two we have over here a new track from Phoebe Bridgers singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers indie darling Phoebe Bridgers we have the track garden song it's I I think it's a little underwhelming but still I liked the weirdly dark subtly psychedelic alterations to the vocals and the instrumental that just made it feel a little odd a little left-field the song for the most part I could take or leave but there was some notable sound play going on that made it sound a little subversive and a little odd and I did like that characteristic about it we have also a new track from neck-deep which is a pop punk rager not the most stand out stuff in the genre and and my opinion of neck-deep has kind of been that for a while but I thought the performance is really good on this one you know it was a nice tight recording and you know certainly a lot of energy coming off of this track so I like that about it like that we have also a new track over here I guess a bit of an extra song here a non-album song from Hunter Hunt Hendricks under the liturgy name it's it's kind of a follow up to the song paso Kalia to pass Kelley at 2 if you guys remember that track from the new H aqq record that I praised so lovingly last year now again update to that song but it's it's like a weird experimental metal rap bang with very out-there lyrics that if you've followed or read any of hunter's writings on music and philosophy you know you can kinda already guess where the lyrics are going to be coming from but look this m-f spin I'll say that he's spittin he's just spitting on this one he spit in fire Oh stupid love new Lady Gaga track a lot of people been asking me what I think about this one came out just toward the end of the week so I didn't have time to do a formal track review of it but I'm torn on it I mean I'll say this I like that Gaga is doing a bit of a throwback electro thing on the song and the instrumental that much is cool that much is fun that much is groovy that quality about it is energetic that's really kind of the part of the song that gets me hooked in but these are the dumbest lyrics that the Gaga is like laid onto a song in a long time the dumbest got her hex in a while like some of the worst lyrics she's put out since Born This Way and that album has particularly lyrics and it's sad because I felt like lyrically she was a little bit on an uptick with artpop and with her last full-length record but this is just going way back down but vocally the performance isn't bad so you know if the lyrics don't bug you and you're just a hardcore Gaga fan most likely you will love the fuck out of this track for those of you who love dance pop Gaga who loved Gaga who's making songs for the club that type of shit you'll dig it the you know it's it'll be an amazing return it's awesome but if you're looking for something that you know just has a better hook to it and you know you won't feel embarrassing you then the might be a slightly harder pill to swallow moving on from there is jhené aiko we have a new track from her featuring future and also featuring a chan uh naw than freakin Miguel is on here too and I think the three have good chemistry on this song but I it's it's a bit of a snoozer in my opinion it's a bit of a snoozer I can't really say too much more than that happiness over everything ho is the name of the track clever title clever concept as well I don't know if Miguel was entirely necessary but you know I think the three work together pretty well on this track it's just just a little underwhelming but but a lot more structured than some of the stuff she put out on that 90 minute record a while back so you know I'm I'll be looking forward to a new a janay record and I guess I guess we'll hear it when we hear it and we will know what it is when it is what it is we have three not one but three brand-new tracks from injury reserve they put them out just a few days ago I believe threw them up on their YouTube channel and they're a real mix like stylistically none of the songs are similar really jumping all over the place and I think there's incredible potential on each track especially the two longer cuts but really held me back on each of them is that they're all kind of low five very messy seems like they were throwing of caution to the wind and just saying fuck it let's do a weird thing or maybe an idea that wouldn't be as hooky or as punchy as something that we would normally do on one of our commercial records so I don't know if this is gonna be indicative of a direction for the trio because this seems like you know a bit more thrown together than the quality of work they usually put out there but I still think as far as like throw just throwing shit at a wall and seeing what sticks there are some really interesting ideas on each of these tracks so you know I just kind of take this as a bit of a crapshoot you know let's just throw it out there see what people react to you know especially um I'll say uh not rock and roll because that was the most low-key of the three tracks but um the song hoodwinked was maybe my favorite of the three that one went pretty hard I will say that alright moving on from there we have a new track from Chicago rapper g herbo featuring chance the rapper and lil Uzi vert the title of this one is PTSD juice world is on it as well so you know it's it's kind of a stacked track juice world's hook is good chance to rappers features okay a little Aussie bird is like way way way way way on the back end like he's barely an afterthought on the song he just has very little mic presence and it just seems like it was thrown on with the track I don't really sort of get what exactly he was trying to do just throwing Lulu Z on so late and having him on for such a short amount of time but what sort of underwhelmed me truly about this track and many other tracks on this new herbo record is the productions weak man the production is just weak and I feel like the rapping is usually so off time on a lot of his projects because you know because he gets passionate and it's not something that it's it's sort of like an established style past this point that the the the beats kind of have to like be good to make up for a little bit and that is just not the case on this one yeah just not just not crazy about this track had a lot of potential especially given all names and voices involved but I just don't really think it reached it's a full potential all right Chicago freestyle Chicago freestyle I put here because this I think is maybe the the better of the two tracks that Drake put out I thought he had some better bars and a better energy on the back end of this double song music video that he just put out which is was you know impeccably directed and shot like Drake's really trying to give us this sense that oh man his life's a movie just Drake's life is like fucking uncut gems bro it's like uncut gems he's in the jewelry story stacking monies just like you know this this just money waving kingpin but I mean really a lot of the lyrics on the front end of this track just make him look more like a pinhead if anything because look it's it's a classic Drake formula in that he is over a very glamorous instrumental he is a moding a moding a moding he's rapping about his present-day updating you on his mental getting a little introspective and just doing all these like humble brags you know sounding a little melancholy but simultaneously constantly reminding you of how rich and famous and great he is without much in the way of like a strong song or a strong structure he's just kind of like sadly jerking off in your ear for a few minutes and then look that's a winning formula for Drake it's not a bad track it's not a bad song but like all he's gonna do is set you up with this and then the same exact thing he's given you time and time and time and time again and then he's going to use that to get you excited get your mouths watering just to disappoint you with a mediocre fucking project with a million duds on it so why even get excited that's all I'm saying all right let's move on we have a new track over here from Christine and the Queen's new EP out as well this one is a bit of a new wave banger it's got some nice tight beats and since on it a good vocal energy as well I don't think it's the strongest song I've heard out of the project and a lot of Christine in the Queen's material typically does underwhelmed me a little bit Caroline Poehler check on the song I don't think necessarily brings up the the the hype all that much either even though I was very much in love with her last record but uh you know you guys might enjoy this one a little bit more than me so give it a try give it a shot especially you know if you did love that Caroline record if you did love the Christine and the Queen's appearance on the last Charlie record you know give it a listen we also have over here a brand new track from none other than car seat headrest can't cool me down reviewed this one full-length style on the Fantana channel and and we'll Toledo essentially switches to more of an electronic sound on this track more sequence beats more synths even though there are some pretty raw guitar bits and and background vocals on this one I think the pacing of the track is a little tedious frankly the song is okay and I think the instrumental and the mixing and everything is a bit dry while I don't doubt that will could do a record in this style that sounds great I think that I don't know I'm gonna require something that's a little bit more sonically interesting if he's going to continue to put out tracks like this because this to me just felt a little flat and while wills records tend to be a little messy a little loaf I I feel like his approach to that style and that aesthetic is is very creative and and texturally rich whereas this to me just felt texturally deficient and look if you're not um if you're not exploring sound I personally don't think you're exploring anything as a musician so all right we have a new track over here from 2 Chainz no TV which is is an OK track it's a pretty low-key track banger not much in terms of a strong hook on this one a few funny gems and one-liners here and there but not that usual sort of super clever hilarious 2 Chainz energy better that he broke with so many years ago earlier last decade but it's it's not bad it's not bad and let's get into the best tracks the best ones of which there are quite a few there are a lot of great tracks to point out this week in my opinion so let's get to it let's get to it first off yung lean has a brand new cut out which is a little sad a little shoegaze II a little trappy boy life in EU is the name of it and I'm like in this direction I'm liking it it's it's not - excuse me dissimilar to some of the stuff he was doing on his last record but this time it feels a bit more euphoric and bright kaleidoscopic in a way so uh I don't know I'm liking it I'm fucking with it hell yeah sad boys for life I guess we have also a track from a death metal band by the name of warp chamber I hope that's how I'm supposed to be saying it warp chamber and abdication of the mind is the name of the song and this is a heavy like six minute multi-phased rager with chunky ass riffs brutal vocals and just absolutely killer absolutely killer deadly performance deadly performance on this one I'll say that we have a new track from lil Uzi vert which interpolates the melody - I won't it that way tami way like not that part up just more than that that way part but it's it's one of his better tracks in a while I mean mostly because it has a bit more structure and a stronger chorus then Newsies latest stuff is typically had and it has that because it obviously borrows the chorus from another song but still as flows an energy throughout the track are good it is a pretty trim song at three minutes and the instrumental goes relatively hard as well so I don't know sounded like a winning formula to me it definitely has me excited for this new project which we have been waiting for forever the band Thicke has their new record coming out next week and seems like they're a bit of a punkish garages garage ish indie rock ish outfit and this new song and music video they've just dropped mansplain is clever hilarious smart and has me excited to listen to the rest of this album you know no guarantee that I'm gonna love the rest of it or anything that I will say I think this one track is a great and smart and entertaining commentary alright hilariously enough I truly and honestly fuck with this new season and Justin Timberlake song but for the goddamn trolls movie franchise it's just a really good pop song that's that's all I can really say Justin's vocals are fine he doesn't really get in the way or ruin the track Sousa is great on the song the groove and the hook on the track are both incredible and sharp as hell one downside of the whole thing is a why is scissor doing all the amazing costume changes in the music video and Justin just looks like some old fuddy-duddy and a fucking black jacket the whole goddamn time come on dude give me a break up up up the game bro up the game okay we expect more of you your Justin Timberlake we have over here ooh this was truly and honestly if you can get a hold of this track which it's around but uh if you can hear this song which I will speak more at length on this song and a video on the Fantana channel but this is a song from an artist by the name of rumor I believe that's how you say this artist name rascal is the title of the song and it is another country rap crossover I guess you could say but it's really more of a country ballad than anything but with a trap inspired lyrics beautiful vocals moving touching wonderful apparently the whole thing is really a I don't want to spoil too much as I'm going to be talking about it in the video but it's not entirely an original song I'll say that and I will get into that more later but this was like my song of the week I was listening to this over and over and over and over it's wonderful it's gorgeous it's lovely I couldn't get enough of it and I'll speak more about it in in the future and speak more about this artists in the future as well as we hear more tracks and know and understand more all right perfume genius brand new cut over here new record on the way as well and this was a very kind of interestingly lo-fi turn for Mike's music I mean obviously loaf eyes is a sound and a style that might very much started out in but this over here the song described was very fuzzy was very layered buzzing trippy sad as well as many perfume genius tracks tend to run like it I fuck with it I dig it I'm excited for more I want to hear more maybe not more exactly like this but I am excited by the prospect of you know Mike may be returning to his roots a little bit or just pushing forward into a bunch of different sounds a variety of sounds just as he did on a no shape as all those tracks instrumentally on that record sort of went a lot of different directions so you know who the hell knows where this new perfume genius record is gonna go but as long as Mike maintains his artistry is a great songwriter you know ultimately that is going to decide the quality of this record so you know and I expect that to continue because Mike is a good songwriter Mike is a good artist Mike is a talent talent a talent hopefully hopefully mike is listening hello Mike you're talented you're a talented person and the world is better with you amazing PE apparently this this project is connected to the band pill which I've always been a little on the fence with like I've loved their you know post-punk aesthetic but there was always something about their sound or their songwriting that kind of held me back whereas this to me just felt like a really wild noisy sax backed post-punk dance party disco ish rager that that I just kind of like fell for immediately the name of this track over here is I don't want to get that mixed up for use pink shiver pink shiver PE pink shiver give it a try give it a shot we have also here the magnetic fields I guess a bit of a quickie or something this track about of the day the politicians died which is very lovely and relatable ballot very lovely and relatable ballot I don't know if this is a you know exactly like the the type of you know political you know how come I want to see but you know it's still still it's it's a vibe survive besides it's a vibe I I can I can vibe with message wise we have also ooh Lianne La Havas is back amazing voice amazing songwriter she has graced us once more with new single new record on the way and it is it is a great performance it is a great vocal is a great soulful punchy tune that I think is one of her best songs to date bittersweet is the title if I didn't already say that and do not miss out on this song because land just uh excuse me continues to kill it as as artists who are as talented as her tend to do alright moving on from there Kelly Lee Owens electronic music producer is back with a great techno Jam the the title of this one that I want to make sure that you get is melt and love the beat on this one love the groove love that very austere techno energy coming off this one and while it wasn't super crazy about her last LP you know give me more tracks like this I'll be I'll be excited for the new one I'll be there I'll be aligned for that shit so yeah give it a try don't miss it don't miss it we also have Jesse we're over here which I praised her last single you know as being like some great dressing-room core and and I feel like this song is is also great but not necessarily in the same vein this one's a lot more disco influenced and I'm loving it as well this has been the most I have enjoyed Jesse we're singles in a long time really maybe really ever I'm liking how this new project is shaping up if we're getting tracks like this because the groove is great the song is great the vibe is very mellow and pretty and beautiful dazzling sparkling I guess I could say the track is as well and because of the disco energy feels like a bit of a throwback to so Jesse where spotlight give it a listen we have also over here just Williamson singer-songwriter just Williams and with a very solid piece of indie tinged alt-country that's a good ballad it's good tune vocals are solid production is quality and looking forward to hearing more off of this record we have also over here an artist a rapper that I've just come into this past week as well someone just sent me an email with this song and music video John ed is his name I believe Fiat and what I will say is this dude sounds nice sounds noise sounds nice on the mic he sounds nice on that mic like the type of artist who you can imagine going on sway and you know doing like an amazing freestyle or something like he's got that kind of voice he's got that kind of delivery but it's not like some old boring like you know just old stale old head shit it's very new it's very crisp it's very young it's very smart and I'm diggin it I'm fuckin with it we have also an artist over here that Austin turned me on to this track you know but I'm recommending it because you know came by him but I enjoyed it as well it's a very lovely beautiful piece of I guess you could say chamber full chamber I wouldn't say pop but yeah very a left-field chamber folk the artist is a Chico a Oba and ya and you let em you let him is the name of the track sorry for my pronunciation and all that but it is a truly beautiful song wonderful chords wonderful vocals great atmosphere beautiful balance of instrumentation as well you know if you are into very extravagant lovely beautifully layered folk music you know again with that kind of chamber twist give it a listen give it a shot you will you will dig it moving on from there Gorillaz Desilu brand new song brand new single from their song machine series I give this one a full review over on the Fantana channel it's very sad it's very Frenchy it's very poppy it's very well balanced and produced gorillas with this whole song machine thing are two for two I'm loving it I'm loving it I'm loving it we have also over here the fool's gold duo Duck Sauce are back with a brand new single very very very very very fun and funky house over here great grooves I'm loving that as well also disclosure has a new EP ecstasy the title track from it is linked down below I do want to give this one a review so I'm not going to talk too much about it but it is it is some great house I will say that Dirty Projectors new track new video new single and a singer I'm not sure long strength is worked with before I need to double-check on that but but still the singing on is lovely it's a pretty straightforward ballad you know nothing too complicated or complex or left-field about it maybe one of the most straight songs that Dirty Projectors have put out in a while but still beautiful dynamic and meticulously assembled ballad with a lot of flavor character and heart so there's that digging on this new Amon a track over here is well it's kind of a short track banger with a lot of personality a lot of funny one-liners a lot of character as he typically tends to put into his songs I will say there were a lot of tracks off of his last mixtape that I thought were very underwhelming this to me is a nice change of pace I had some kind of funny ODB references as well and it was titled shimmy so you kind of expect that but we have also ooh 100 gex with ringtone but now featuring Charli XCX Rico nasty and Caro Caro Benito and you would figure with all those artists and names that this new version would just turn into a frickin like garbage mess but it doesn't each one of them are fantastic on the track they all are separated and parsed out very nicely and they each bring their own thing to the song and I love it I love it I love that gex did this it's an incredibly stacked song with a lot of talent a lot of great voices and it comes together so well so you know I'm very happy for them with this remix because it's it's it's an amazing you know an amazing remix revision whatever you want to call it it's amazing it's amazing and that is it for the weekly track roundup wow there's a lot of tracks it's a lot of songs in this episodes 30 fucking minutes so it was a lot of ground it was a lot of material to cover but still everything there and especially in that best section recommend recommend recommend and I will see you guys in the next video you're the best Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever

NoOWjMKLzoI,hi everyone know that Hebert you know here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Grimes album miss Anthropocene this is the newest full-length album from vocalist producer and songwriter Grimes it's been 5 years since the last record art angels which is my favorite grimes album and album that last year she referred to as a piece of crap artists can often have complicated feelings on their past works especially if their newest material is taking them in a totally different direction so honestly I sort of took this comment as a reason to be excited because if Grimes thinks that records crap what she's doing next has got to be way better or way different and for a while now she has been teasing fans with some exciting music like the track we appreciate power and awesomely produced foray into industrial metal but the song dropped all the way back in 2018 and since then has only ended up on this record as a bonus track however there still was my name is dark a somewhat freaky and alternative piece of pop rock with a grimy bassline a punchy beaten guitars as well as a sick sing-along chorus the boys are such a boy that gives us such a bond and there's also delete forever an acoustic ballad that reads like a 90s radio hit the songs sudden shift into all of this plucky folk instrumentation though it various points especially toward the end isn't all that well done though it doesn't weave into the beat or the synth bassline as well as it could still though having said that it is one of the best and most well-written songs on the entire record as a teaser I did think so heavy I fell through the earth was pretty underwhelming but I still went into this LP with a lot of high hopes and excitement but ultimately just wound up disappointed how did miss Anthropocene end up so malformed inconsistent and unfocused I guess I should take it back to so heavy I fell as it is the intro track to the record which i think is a very weak placement for it the instrumental on this track sounds like a cross between 90s pop a bit of trip-hop and some new-age music too it goes on for six minutes and for that and Grimes just vaguely emotes here and there without much in the way of any coherence or direction I mean there are some cool instrumental swells on the track here and there but it's it's not a structure as the track really begins to run out of ideas around the halfway point and everything past that just starts to get very tedious what's even worse is the following track dark scene which features a pretty simple boom clap beat industrialized synth it's a dark atmosphere and then loads and loads and loads of pretentious spoken word and rambling speedy vocal passages unrest is in the soul we don't move our bodies anymore and then with all the fast disorienting rambling that's auto-tuned at some points on the track it sounds like how anna-marie but bad plus the instrumental variations on this track do nothing to keep it interesting at all honestly the track is an instant skip for me and we're just on the second song here there's also the song violence which I forgot was a teaser as well in 2019 and it's easy to realize why as it's a very middle-of-the-road piece of electro pop with a decent groove some cool synth swells as well as a nice vocal earworm you wanna there's also the matter of the lyrics on the track which seemed to fetishize violence in a relationship context and it's obviously intended to be self-aware I don't think Grimes is Pro abuse but in a weird way it does make the whole prospect of that seem playful possibly the intent is to display the mindset of someone who is used to this in a way where they now seek it out which can be a twisted way of making a commentary on it yes but I I don't think it quite lands personally the following track features an epic instrumental setup that ultimately does not give out much of a payoff as at one point Grimes transitions into these really goofy animated vocal passages backed up with a break beat just comes off super gimmicky and as we transition between these two points again it doesn't get any more interesting New Gods is a decent ballad in the tracklist but it's just too washed out to really get a hold of it I just don't see the benefit of this level of reverb I mean it's easily one of the most focused songs on the entire record but it's it's just not pulling me in meanwhile you'll miss me when I'm not around is another track that takes on a bit of a pop rock form but this time sounding a bit more euphoric generally but this song is marked by one of the more underwhelming vocal performances on the entire record it's kind of difficult to get this song off the ground when what you're laying on to the track vocally is just so blase plus there's a few points where the background vocals sound just as loud as the lead vocals so as they're overlapping it just sounds like a jumbled mess unfortunately the album's ending isn't all that strong either before the fever has so many bright buzzing layers of what I don't know because it's all soaked in so much reverb it's difficult to describe or decipher the sound of it is so searing it's like staring into the Sun it's unpleasant to say the least meanwhile the bird sounds and funny Airy cords on the closing track feel like a knockoff of the flutes and nature sounds off of Bjork's last record of course these sounds only end up playing a small role in a more built-up instrumental with punchy urbeats mushy vocals and very awkward scent passages like Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Minh Bennett's it's not a very interesting progression at all I guess I can say it's the track that most resembles like a song that could have been on visions if you're really missing that era of grimes music I guess but seriously the composition of this track is so painfully plain I I'm just shocked that Grimes would want to sing over it this might be my least favorite Grimes album even in comparison with her debut which I still think is pretty interesting this thing may have a big sound but the ideas are microscopic or just incoherent and very few of them actually rien for each other and build up into a project that is greater than the sum of its parts plus to not be able to work we appreciate power into such a seemingly random album doesn't really make all that much sense and all the mixes the alternate mixes on the end don't really add that much the album's experience either yeah I'm actually kind of blown away that we waited five years for this because this is not a well-groomed album at all I'm feeling a decent too strong for on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a another video that

YqLDx2PnOYM,hi everyone vac and he's seen him here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Royce to 5/9 record the allegory this is the newest full-length LP from one of the troice most skilled rappers royce two five nine and there was a time when Royce wasn't seen as much more than that guy that had a really good feature on Eminem Slim Shady LP but Royce's longevity through the 2000s combined with his output over this past decade has made him one of the most respected vets today with quality verses when he was one-fourth of slaughterhouse those beloved collapse he did with DJ Premier along with super hefty projects like layers and book of Ryan Royce's eighth album over here might be his most ambitious undertaking yet with a great feature list with everyone from Vince staples to the Grizelda boys to Ti Royce also handles a lot of the production on this record too while he's no DJ premier the instrumentals on this thing aren't that bad I would actually say they're one of the record selling points royce has a pretty good ear for beats and i like that a majority of them have interestingly weird characteristics like the fat loaf i mix on the track i don't age with all these heavenly harp runs or that kooky rigid quarter note bassline on dope man boo boo boo then there's the beat on pendulum which is super stark straight back to the point where it's almost awkward that worked detune lead melody throughout the track is so strange meanwhile I play forevers instrumental features this huge chunk of sound super dramatic from what sounds like an old black-and-white movie soundtrack it's super villainous in the same way that an MF DOOM track might be so in a way I'm not surprised that Royce had a hand and the beats on this thing because as a producer he doesn't have an established sound so as a result the production on here isn't really boxed into a certain style but despite this project being titled the allegory and having a very huge gigantic and almost cinematic setup in the first couple of tracks along with there being a skit where the definition of allegory is pretty much said verbatim then album is not much of an allegory there's no super coherent or linear storyline to follow from track to track to track and whatever meaning or moral message Royces packing into this record it doesn't leave much up to the imagination as his intent and his political points of view are made very clear which in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing especially since I see eye to eye with him on a lot of the stuff he's saying in terms of systemic racism financial literacy independence the drug war exploitation in the music industry as well as greed and opportunism in drug-dealing but still the record just feels like more of a scattered array of tracks working off a loose set of themes again not so much a focused allegory which in theory would be fine at most of the verses and tracks here we're great which they pretty much are I think Royce is truly in rare form on this project whether he's focusing on writing from the standpoint of a character on the track dope man or just rattling off all of these funny or witty one-liners they say you are what you eat but I never ate gum or that one line when he says he's cold enough to go on a date with the 8th December and then make the winter pay for the rest of the dinner but also take note of Royce's poetry and line of thought on the midst of grace intro to the record or the second half of overcomer easily these are two of the most refined moments in Royce's discography as of late especially with bars like checks and balances by the curb steps to amateurs flying birds connected annual to buy in a surge expect in the amateurs to try and merge I find it strange the last few bars are basically this admittance of Royce being kind of closed-minded when it comes to sexual orientation but then reminding the audience actually I'm shallow here which in a way he confirms later on the record on the track upside down whose opening bars personally I interpreted as being quite homophobic so I guess as long as Royce isn't saying anything that's overtly cringy we're discriminatory the lyricism is pretty much there what's most important though is do all of these separate elements come together into good songs I think they do a majority of the time like the chillin banger thou shalt or black savage which is a Kanye sized multi featured epic with one great verse after another and all of these calming chants laced into the instrumental - personally I think the end of the LP does drag on a little bit and the Topix Royce approaches at this point only serves as a reminder that the allegory of this record isn't really being built up or added to all that much I think the only track I overtly disliked was tricked with King crooked annoying booming beat on this one and a super tedious flow trick we've been tricked it's a trick you're a trick I'm a trick I've been tricked she's been tricked he's been tricked ah the concept of the song itself is not bad but this really needed to go back to the drawing board look the only other major issue I had with this record and I do have to talk about this and I might have to talk about it for a little bit is the messaging and the skits like Eminem's appearance on the record where I think he has his heart in the right place on this one as I guess he is trying to give legitimacy to the idea that one might grow up with a chip on his or her shoulder being black and feeling unrepresented and disrespected in a different culture in a white culture also exploring this idea of rock music essentially being usurped in a way by Elvis being the king of rock and roll however Eminem doesn't seem to turn the clock forward and acknowledge that his impact on hip hop was not Elvis level in terms of dictating the tone of the genre entirely but still I mean you know the the the there's still you know an impact to be measured and discussed in in an Elvis type of way I think but Eminem actively avoids engaging in that really obvious part of the conversation and then there are the multiple mentions and jabs throughout the record against modern medicine and science specifically vaccinations Royce going as far as to blatantly say that his son got autism from vaccinations which not only has there been a ton of research on from the vaccination side but look there are very well-funded foundations out there that do research on autism every day and while there have been found to be environmental factors that impact this genetic disorder vaccinations have not been shown to be one of them but even without autism as a reason Roy seems to be generally against the idea of inoculations listen to the black people in America sketch and you will hear it right there at the kickoff and look I'll say much of what I said in my Freddie Gibbs review my bandana review when this very same topic came up while this is not acceptable in a way it is understandable because historically what you must understand is that our health care system for generations has massively failed and mistreated black Americans from lack of care inadequate care statistically doctors treating black patients differently than they do white patients also higher rates of death for things that are easily treatable or prevented and if you want to get really dark look up the Tuskegee Experiment so combine all of these things and have them carry out over generations and of course you're going to have distrust of the system and then pile on to it the heartbreak and the shock of finding out that your kid has this disorder that there's so little understanding of so while I I feel for this man's pain and you know I wish it could all go away this is not something I want people internalizing especially with something like coronavirus on the rise if we find ourselves in a place where there's a vaccine available should anyone be listening to this albums advice to avoid a corona virus vaccine no of course not assuming that it's properly tested and it's vetted and the FDA proves it yes es yes of course obviously I want all vaccines to be approved and safe but having said all of that no vaccine should not be avoided so look at the end of the day I think this record features a pretty solid list of tracks questionable ideas here and there good instrumentals and an allegory a concept that is pretty weakly executed if you ask me maybe these issues will improve the next time around at least I hope so I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and yeah over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel and I hope all of you are doing well and had a fun time watching this one Anthony Fantana raise to five nine forever 
z6y4M7HVRXg,okay all right all right hi everyone breathe any easy tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new BTS album map of the soul seddon this is the latest full-length LP from kpop sensations BTS map of the souls 7 we did not get a record from the group in 2019 but they did hold us over with the map of the soul persona EP this past spring most of which has carried over into the first leg of map of the soul 7 including the group's incredibly popular crossover with Halsey boy with love but despite the first portion of soul 7 essentially being out this record still has a lot of new material to offer as the entire album is over 70 minutes long that's a lot of BTS maybe it's too much BTS as I can't really listen to this entire thing without feeling some sort of ear fatigue and look not that BTS is international blend of pop and rap and electro is bad when it's delivered in a reasonable dose and attached a good songwriting it's great but Soul sevens not just overloaded but also bogged down in some of the most derivative and thankless songs the group has put out so far whether it be the tedious shadow interlude that is backed up with a Travis Scott ripoff toward the very end that's totally unnecessary or the track Black Swan which is a huge single for BTS but stylistically sonically it's pretty much a basic combination of pop and moody atmospheric trap it's actually kind of shocking the group would put out a song that is this behind the curve meanwhile the vocal processing and the gargantuan production on louder than bombs as well as with the track on see the group reaching new levels of pompous Ness no longer on these tracks to BTS sound like the fresh-faced young versatile group of singers and artists that made them so exciting to begin with now they're just making what sounds like over budgeted movie trailer music a lot of boom a lot of drama a lot of layers but not much in the way of personality or intimacy I mean a 20 track record from BTS wouldn't be a big deal that the whole thing was just in a amazing fantastic display of the group's versatility and charm but that's really hard to gauge when you're talking about tracks like my time one of the records many tracks that are very bright very squeaky-clean very airbrushed touched up while the song is an awful it's completely devoid of any textures that sound the least bit interesting or organic I feel like I'm just stuffing my face with Kraft singles or really sugary candy for over an hour straight and look that's not to say the record is completely devoid of highlights it's not the tracks that stood out as being great from the map of the soul persona EP still sound good here we also have the track filter which is an acoustic fusion of reggaeton and pop fronted by Jimin the vocals on this one are super light and slick as hell meanwhile the lyrics read like a Q commentary on vanity and love obviously through the scope of cellphones and camera filters will change your world I'm your filter apply to your heart it's tuneful it's groovy and feels like a pretty tasteful nod to some of the sounds that the Latin music scene has been crossing over into the mainstream with lately then we have the song banger alert banger alert banger alert this track is pretty much Yuga and j-hope and rap monster just dropping high energy flows for three minutes straight the beat here is super quirky and hits hard with some massive bass and sour synth leads sure some of the wild Travis Scott inspired auto-tune breaks aren't entirely necessary but I guess they do add some fun to the song ultimately I just wish there were more moments on the record like this and while this track is pretty visceral that doesn't mean it goes without a message as many of the lyrics on this one seemed to deal in anger as a concept as an agent of change as a part of the human experience immediately after we have the song zero o'clock which in my opinion has some of the best singing on the record has one of the best crafted hooks on the record the airy vocal harmonies on this track make me feel like I am living in an idyllic cloud society where I just float on a Nimbus wherever I want to go but me and everyone lives in this cloud society are still a wee bit sad meanwhile the lyrics on this track are pretty sentimental and address time and the change or lack thereof that comes along with it we then have a very so-so last leg of the record in my opinion the song respect is another high-energy rap cut with some pretty funky keys that develop into smooth wavy chords later a tight trap beat as well some high energy from suga and rap monster in a way the track sounds like a very positive take on what could have been a radio ready pop rap hit from the 2000s however we are bulletproof the eternal is one of many songs that just makes this record drag on for me as the production is so bright so shiny so overwhelming that I just feel blinded like much of this record just has me boxed up in this tiny room where I can't tell what time of day it is I'm sleep-deprived I'm disoriented again despite how good some of the material on the back end of this record may be the whole thing is so consistently synthetic and bright and just the the mids on it are so high that it again the ear fatigue which is why the busy and multifaceted and somewhat zany outro ego is a little hard to take in because I mean the record really does kind of beat me down a little bit so by the time we have these animated rap verses set to a beat that feels like a very strange fusion of hip-hop and a throwback dance pop hit I'm pretty burnt out I'm gonna be honest and I'm the kind of person that doesn't even mind a 2-hour album if it's sequenced well so map of the soul 7 personally I just found to be a bloated slog of a record I don't even really see what adding persona to the front end of this thing really brought to the project but truly and honestly that's just where some of the records most major issues begin as a good chunk of songs on this thing actually ended up being forgettable overblown or just not really applying the original charm that made BTS so interesting to begin with so even though there are some great tracks here and if you paired the whole thing down to it best moments you may have a record that's even better than love yourself tear in its current state though it's just not well groomed enough to be that I'm feeling a strong four to la-5 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that

cTUxGqQBPFM,hey everyone sickening eyes tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new king cruel record man alive this is the latest full-length LP from king cruel a music project based in the UK spearheaded by singer-songwriter Archie Marshall this is his third full-length album and it feels like it's taken ages to get to this point maybe because he spent the 2010s as one of the industry's more shadowy figures slipping in and out of view with each album cycle the last of which was 2017 the Hoos if the ooze were location it would be one of the most barren and despondent places imaginable a musical purgatory where time pretty much stands still and album that is beloved by King cruel fans not so much by me too much of this LP fell ill defined emotionally potent but structurally deficient however this time around with man alive everything is sounding a lot more direct while still bringing a powerfully despondent sound stylistically and emotionally man alive is not a far cry away for many moments on the ooze with numerous genres flowing through it but not one of them taking precedence as Archie delivers these compartmentalized and depressive waves of psychedelic art rock post-punk and jazz like the opening track cellular with its driving punchy sequence drums swirls of synth arpeggios deep growling bassline also some strange sound effects - all being paired with some truly surreal poetry delivered in Archie's thickly accented voice it is equal parts strange and euphoric we then see an interesting shift in the following track which is a dark minimal and stark post-punk monologue paired with the kind of deep bass and tight echo delays you typically hear at a dub song Archie then adds these twisted guitar embellishments that he just screams his heart out over really just pulling me further into this sad abyss that he has going on very early on this record and this song honestly feels like a setup in a way to the following tracks stoned again where Archie screams and his feelings of disgust really reach an apex he's really pulling off these freakish shouts over booming drums and a heavy distorted bass line lyrically the track seems like a painful moment as it seems to depict Archie slipping into see maybe even addiction not a pretty moment on the record at all by comparison the following track is much tighter with its speedier beats and angular sour guitar lines not to mention the layers of unsettling effects of what sounds like a sped up sample of a voice talking a very unorthodox batch of sounds that creates a super tense moment on the record especially as Archie builds it higher and higher and higher into a twisted wall of sound at a few points in the track the song the dream felt like an interlude that I really wanted more out of meanwhile the hollow mushy wall of sound on perfect miserable while I didn't hate it it did create a noticeable lull in the tracklist but things do pick up on alone omen 3 where the sound play gets pretty creative much more dramatic too with some spotlit vocals it sounds like being trapped in a hot filthy ratty motel room complete with a slowly rotating ceiling fan over the bed not not a fun place to be the track slinky is yet another tribute to how good the flow of this record is even though it's not directly connected to the previous track here it sounds so good up against the previous track here the dreamy sweet woozy wet guitars on the Scott just take me away to a dreamland that quickly turns into a lynchin nightmare in the last leg there are a few other moments in the tracklist that to me read like so-so motifs that I wish had more flavor structure contrast like drag on airport antenatal airplane also the beautiful theme for the cross whose surreal effects and jazzy piano and deep bass and dejected spoken-word make for a great first leg but then the second half of the song is spent trailing off into a painfully slow fade and sound effects of cars driving by I mean again first half of the song is killer but wish it went to a more interesting place in the end thankfully the record does have a relatively strong finish though the song underclass is a jazzy and hazy ballad complemented with some slightly hypnagogic production it sounds like a lost musical gem from decades ago with its dreamy and strange layers of synth and sax it is yet another moment on the record that reminds me of David Lynch's work I could easily imagine the song being in the original Twin Peaks soundtrack the song energy fleets is another sad that continues this feeling of being caught in a vivid but sad dream I'm struck with sleep paralysis this track quickly transitions into the closer please complete thee which is a stark finisher featuring vocals from Archie that sound a lot tinier and a lot lonelier than his other performances earlier on the record his voice which is typically deep and booming is now calling out in a very sad and shy way over these muddy and droning synth chords the instrumental with its tone and with its effects and with how jeroni it is is almost bordering on dark ambient music however the whole thing does end in a bright shimmering rush of keys and guitar which is another moment on the record that is difficult to interpret because every once in a while it does hit you with a sound palette that feels euphoric feels blissful but maybe ignorant because it doesn't take too long for any of these moments to dissipate and for the darkness to creep back in overall I got to say I love this LP I think it's a lot more evocative than the O's by comparison even though it is functioning on a lot of the same abstract sounds and ideas I think Archie played it a bit more direct and tuneful this time around and there's definitely a benefit to that while I'm not saying that you can't like both records and that you can't get different experiences out of both records in my opinion I think what Archie is doing here is a huge improvement on his last LP several years ago feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this one transition have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you

these nifty awesome metal plated wallets that fit nicely in your front pocket link down below promo code melon 10% off let's go what's what's the first of these worst tracks this week we have a handful BAM first one the birthday party new track from the 1975 I would say the vibe in the feel of this song boils down to a lyric in the song about feeling like you're trapped in a boring conversation that you don't want to have and that's pretty much how this track runs bland instrumental uninteresting lyrics telling an uninteresting story one of the most drab teasers from the band's new new record coming out soon that they have put out so far so I'm not really sure what to say about this one meh moving on from there purity ring new tracks star do sounds like an over produced piece of EDM with singing that is so robotic it's almost Vocaloid I truly do not get it I've never really been a big purity ring fan but I feel like their earlier stuff at least had a somewhat of a cutesy appeal this however does not and then we have a new track from Pearl Jam this is sad what is this the Pearl Jam is sounding like a bunch of old dudes I mean luckily we know they're old dudes from the 90s but given their success they should be aging better than this like this is the sound and performance quality I would expect from a bunch of old regular guys from the 90s performing at local band night half-drunk at some small venue in my in my area within like five miles of me that's that's what this sounds like Pearl Jam should be putting out better stuff and we also have the country remix of Justin Bieber's yummy featuring flirted Georgia line and of course some pedal steel it's trash all right let's move on to the tracks that our met not blown me away but still worth mentioning worth shouting out one oh we have a new track from trippy red this one over here features none other than Russ and it's pretty melodic it's cool it's not as a half-hearted as a lot of material off of his past couple of Records but I feel like Russ really didn't add that much to the track nor is this like the best hooker vocal line that trippy has really laid on to a song I mean even his best material as of late just feels like he's spinning his wheels into the mud and I'm just not really sure what else to say we also have a new track from tricky featuring Anika it's been a while since we've heard from either of these two and yeah it's a very stripped back forlorn piece of electronic music with very dreary vocals and I'm not so much into how skeletal it is but it does it does strike a mood does strike a mood strikes a tone we also have this new track over here from the avalanches featuring none other than blood orange and while I do like the very excuse me very lush mystical instrumental that the avalanche is bring forward on this one yeah you know this one feels more like an interlude a transitional moment more than it feels like a single or something sort of boughs out in a very curious way doesn't really have that strong of a song structure or anything like that though I do think there are some bold bits of instrumentation I do like blood oranges vocal contributions too which are very dramatic so I don't know I'm just hoping to hear this link into everything else on a new avalanches album in a creative and interesting way we also have a new track over here from sparks as well peppy self-aware humorous witty and clever rock music as you have expected from sparks not quite as sharp as they used to be in my opinion but still sparks over the years has maintained a lot of what has made them such an interesting group for sure we also have Ozzy over here with a brand new single off of this new record that I believe is out now features post Malone and it is a thunderous hard-hitting piece of metal music now what turns me off about this track though because there are a lot of things that I like I love how crunchy and badass the guitars are I think post Malone's vocal contribution on this one is nice too but the vocal processing on Ozzy's singing is just way too fucking much and the song itself is just very animated it's very just the energy is super super high to the point where it's almost resembling I guess the the speed and the that you would typically expect out of a like a babymetal song or something I mean babymetal is very popular so I have no doubt that Ozzy or producers that he's working with might want to try to recreate that sound a little bit for him but not so much sure if it's it's working all that well but hey you know it's it's it's definitely not as bad as one might think you know just given how many years Ozzy has been at it I mean is definitely a metal artist out there who's aged a lot better than many of his contemporaries in my opinion we also have a new track over here from none other than man man new song unsub pop it is a schmaltzy bit of piano rock or pop I mean man man has always inhabited a very strange musical place although I'm not really liking how as of late they just play it so straight I feel like they're older stuff used to be a lot more zany and left-field however I will say this is one of the more solid Tunes they have put out in a little bit so man man cloud 9 is the title of this one give it a try give it a shot if not only for the very silly old man dancing in the in the lyric music video we also have this new track from Kyle over here featuring cake amp enrich the kid yes and it's a nice pop rat banger has some strong whistle samples in the background sort of remind me of that old dwell Santana song I don't think it's a sample probably not a sample but the whistles do sound similar in a way just a quick little comparison there for you there you go we also have glass animals over here deja vu is the name of this new cut over here and I'm definitely liking this new single more than the last one where they tried to go in a bit of a hip-hop direction this one has more of a synthetic groovy pop feel to it not super original or anything like that but definitely easier to Bob your head to and nothing that really induced a cringe from yours truly we also have a new track from BTS as their map of the soul 7 record is out now hoping to talk about this one very soon but I'm not going to talk about this new track from SIA at length here because I plan on reviewing the record very soon and would rather sort of give all of my thoughts on it there so it is in the Met category but more thoughts to come soon we also have in latest Morissette singer-songwriter extraordinaire she is back with a new single smiling eye I think it's ok I mean her voice is as bold as ever it's aged so well but I do not care for the super slow and atmospheric and just very reverb heavy style of production that she has been looped into on this one I mean I know it's a trend I know it's what's prevailing but I just do not feel like it it complements her singing style which again is very bold and I I think requires an instrumental that is a bit more meat on the bone to kind of support her singing in a stronger way so not crazy about the backing instrumentation on this one even if I am still dead still enjoying her vocal abilities after all these years let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best ones the best ones this week let's go we have a new track over here from Eve tumor the name of this new single over here is gospel for a new century and like some of the best tracks off of the last tumor record this takes a somewhat subversive approach to some Britpop sounds with some more lo-fi and experimental production great songwriting - I'm loving it loving it loving it loving it also Willie Nelson with a heartbreaking ballad first rows of spring again heartbreaking tears rolling down my fucking face on this one no Jesus not good not good at all not good at all everyone we also have a new track from Thundercat Dragonball do-rag very funny silly tongue-in-cheek groovy and hilarious looking forward to this new record from Thundercat because this one was definitely a smooth funky and I already said I'm already I'm just repeating where it's here because I'm just so distracted with the the stuffiness and I apologize for that but I'm digging it did a review of this one over on the Fantana channel - and it's a good one it's good one we also had the weekend over here reviewed this one on the Fantana Channel is well after hours is the name of the new single I'm liking the mix of Abel's usual sound with some 80s throwback stew good songwriting and very creative instrumental with some subtle nods to club music that blossom and progress in a very epic and cinematic way cool outro on this track too and yeah definitely a respectable teaser from the weekend we have strokes bad decisions new single from them not as interesting in my opinion as the last teaser as instrumentally and even production wise because it's a little low Phi it sounds a lot like their old stuff like the you know is this it era strokes which I'm sure some fans are kind of excited about I you know as much as I do love that air of The Strokes music in some respects I can take or leave the idea of them just going back to trying to do exactly that thankfully the songwriting on this track is good and I guess the track here knowingly interpolates a Billy Idol song in a pretty creative way it's not super obvious but you know once you hear Julian singing about the bad decisions the bad decisions that's where you're gonna kind of pick it up but the song dancing with myself from Billy Idol is the track that you're gonna want to reference back to but yeah it's fuzzy slow fie striving it's rocking and yeah it's got a decent energy to it so uh Strokes bad decisions diggin it we also have over here another track from Archie under the King cruel name album out now reviewing it soon the one over here that I wanted to point to your attention is cellular I'm liking this one as well and not gonna go too deeply into it because I do plan on reviewing this album very soon we also have JPEG mafia balled new track that instrumentally and flowise reminded me of at least a few moments off of veteran liked it thought it was produced well thought it was wrapped well while I would like to hear JPEG mafia continue to break new ground I would totally love and take this track if it ends up fitting in to a tracklist on a great record at the end of the day we also have Jesse Lanza lick in heaven which in my opinion is maybe one of the best best like dressing-room mall clothing store core dance songs I've ever heard in my life like and you know I don't mean to say that to demean the track like it does very much sound like a super Airy dance pop to that you would typically hear planning over the speakers and the mall but the song is great the production is fantastic and the vocals were solid too so I can't really hate on it next we have a song from the artist known as Jackie Lynn who you may already be familiar with because she is the same Chicago based singer-songwriter who currently releases records under the name circuit day you however under this Jackie Lynn name under which she has released one record prior she's sort of drifts away from the typical styles of music that she's known for and at least in this case with this song sugar water embraces some weird throwback New Wave pop with some left-field punk influences I mean it's it's a little dated I guess you could say but it's very creative it's very fun and super catchy too so huge huge huge respect to this stylistically it's right in my wheelhouse and it's done incredibly well from there moving on from there we have this track over here total banger that quite a few people online are freaking out about right now goopy I hope I'm pronouncing a GU piece name correctly a goopy and frack see'em sauce moser hope I'm pronouncing that correctly as well is the name of this track and yeah it's it's an insane auto-tuned dance banger that is mentally fried in much the same way that pretty much like 100 gex music is but it doesn't sound like a 100 gak song if you kind of catch my group if you if you kind of catch my drift though sorry stop stuffy going mental here but the point I want to make here is I do get a lot of questions and I do get a lot of asks saying Anthony sans the cough I really like this 100 deck stuff can you tell me more stuff like this stuff that sounds like this stuff and now when people ask me that I will say sir or madam you know guys and gals and non-binary pals this is that stuff so give it a try give it a shot moving on from there oops whoops shout out to this Cincinnati noise rock band over here that I almost passed by a dau mere life gets in the way is the name of this track over here very raw vocals raw production gnarly freakin guitar riffs blast it out and loud as hell give it a try give it a shot and just nasty energy on this one if you want to hear some just raw ass noise rock give it a try give it a shot it's fun song also Brooke candy remix of the song come featuring Sophie total banger hell yes there were there were a few tracks off the Brooke candy that I liked a lot I thought the album overall was a bit of a mess but I loved this remix this remix is excelente in my opinion and we have Anna Calvi over here with a song featuring Charlotte Gainsbourg and Anna's working up to putting out a new record that is essentially revisions of songs from her last record more stripped back dramatic the reinvented in whatever way she feels quite a few guests on the record too and this moment that she has with Charlotte on this song is absolutely dramatic fantastic I would say stunning and give it a try give it a shot even if you weren't listening to or were a fan of Anna's last record because the songs and the revisions that I've been hearing this thus far are that different are that different in tone it's like a totally different record from a totally different artist in a way we also have over here the song cry-baby that I want to point to your attention down in the description from Ariel pink which is an older song but Mexican summer has seen fit to continue their aerial archive series by putting out more remasters of classic Ariel pink albums doldrums we have house arrest and we have worn copy being a part of this new series and I personally you know dig some of areas older stuff from this era especially worn copy which is a one of my favorite - Ariel pink records from this era and I'm pretty excited for this for this remaster and this reissue series because these are great projects that deserve another chance another shot another listen so you know just to kind of put you guys on blast make sure you're aware Arial pink archives new old records coming out crybaby down below give it a try give it a shot and that is going to be it for this weekly track roundup everyone thank you very much for watching you're the best you're the best you're the best you're the best Anthony Fantan Oh a weekly track roundup a new review out soon of forever 
LUKTMDyfoRU,hi everyone so then he drained Tanana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new eden album no future this is the latest album from Irish singer-songwriter producer Eden it is his sophomore record and it's now been a few years since Eden aka Jonathan Inge debuted with vertigo a moody and stark fusion of alternative R&B and indie tronic pop it's a little bland and a little too raw at points but it's still an emotionally potent record one that certainly had me interested in Eden's next musical move I suppose I should also mention this man's successful transition from being an EDM producer under the name the Eden Project to what he's doing now hopefully he's getting more play out of his current sound because no future is a long one with 57 minutes of run times split up amongst 19 tracks with nearly the same range of styles featured on vertigo though maybe Eden's wearing his musical influences on his sleeve a bit more there are moments peppered throughout this album that feel like over references to the Postal Service to Bon Iver even the song the static sounds like an interlude that could have worked into Frank ocean's blond which isn't a bad thing if these ideas are flipped into something refreshing or distinct but I don't personally feel that is the case here despite putting so many tracks on this record a great deal of them just sound so derivative the song love debt distraction just runs like some very low-grade indie folk meanwhile with calm down I guess it is cool to hear something that sounds like a fusion of blood bank and give up but the lack of song structure and redundant chords leave a lot to be desired I mean maybe the perception of intimacy on this track and others here too is hard-hitting for some but all-in-all this track just feels like a rough idea that wasn't fully scaled up now this is how I would categorize a great deal of this LP due in part to the writing to the production but I'm also torn on the vocals that Eden lays down on this LP - they're either so subdued and monie and awash in effects I get little to nothing out of them case in point the song projector I mean the singing is so overcome with emotion the vocals are constantly crack the notes are just bleeding into each other and Eden can't be bothered to articulate most of what he's saying I don't want to reduce his singing style down to something that basic but that truly is what he does for the entire 19 tracks here in a way it reminds me of what Joe gee has done with a lot of his music as of late but a lot less powerful and grand and distinct even in comparison with some of the more lo-fi stuff he's done on ballads but sometimes when Eden's singing is presented more clearly and is backed with some very dramatic instrumentation sounds pretty good it can come off legitimately heart-wrenching like on the cut so far so good with it's bright and blossoming walls of synths and guitar that are pretty immense then there's also 20/20 which is one of the barest and cutest songs on the record at least that's how it sounds from it's very quiet guitars and very close and simple lead vocals super tight super sharp hook on this thing to lyrics that when I read them tell of this intense feeling of betrayal or just wanting to move forward with less naivete and and not being taken advantage of maybe romantically and there's also the bustling pumping percussion the song busts into in the second half that sounds like again something from the Postal Service I'll also say the record is bookended with some pretty good tracks to the intro track here is a bold and beautiful explosion of instrumentation and maybe the most passionate singing on the entire record also the cute lo-fi group vocals on the closing track untitled honestly melts my heart I suppose there's also a somewhat cool post rock crescendo on the song rushing that breaks things up a bit even if this isn't one of my favorite tracks here but even though there are highlights in the tracklist here I can't help but feel like a majority of the material is either just filler or redundant a real lack of structure strong songs memorable vocal performances but the worst point on the record and I do mean the worst is maybe a personal pet peeve of mine one that I just could not deal with on the song streams which if you've ever owned a Mac and iMac or a MacBook or something like that and you know that sound when you hit a keystroke and it doesn't go through because it's not interacting with whatever window you have it on or it's just basically you know a fudged key or something and you hear that sound that dong so yeah if you run a Mac you've heard that sound before and I deeply associate it with something being wrong but for whatever reason this tracks samples that sound or something like it and it's keeping pace as if it were a drum it truly is like uncannily similar to the point where I can't even have it on in the background because I think that I'm like pressing something wrong or I'm needing to shift a window around and grabbing my mouse and I'm just anxious which I guess is a silly reaction to have but it's it's really no love loss at the end of the day because the song itself attached to the track I think is a not one of the stronger ones here anyway look at the end of the day I just found a lot of this project to be plainly produced under written under performed repetitive vague sure eden does sit at a cool crossroads of musical styles but he doesn't really do anything all that memorable or ambitious with it the whole experience of this record is bogged down in mediocre cuts that bleed together because they're so uneventful I wish I could reconcile that by saying but hey there's a whole ton of amazing songs on the album - but I can't feeling a strong four to a light five on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Eden forever 
EMTBCKD2Uy4,hmm hi everyone those knees soft piano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of this new collaboration between Marc kozilek and boy and Jim white - this is the second collaboration between legendary singer songwriter Marc kozilek of Red House Painters and Sun Kil moon fame Chicago multi-instrumentalist Ben boy and dirt III drummer Jim white the first album D Street teamed up on dropped back in 2017 personally I thought it was one of the weaker projects Marc had dropped in that time period but how could you blame me this was the same year as common as light drop in that album is incredible occasionally the instrumentals on this thing felt a little colorless a little muddy but I suppose that was somewhat made up for by the records wild and improvisational approach that does lead down some very strange passageways as entertaining as it is to hear Marc kozilek howling his brains out right after singing about cleaning up hairballs the record was not completely devoid of highlights though like the very personal and moving astronomy a refreshingly focused moment with backing keys and guitars that felt a little Velvet Underground inspired on the vocals we hear Marc sounding curious and hopeful as he is filing through all of these memories in a beautiful way there's also the irresistible groovy and theatrical ashes where Marc sounds like he's a one-man show throwing up jazz hands and doing an interpretive dance to his diatribes on sex aging and food tasting better in its country of origin it's a very long and unpredictable LP that will forever remain an oddball in Casa lex discography for me even if there are some creative parallels with other records that dropped around this same time I should also say for anyone this deep into the review who is unfamiliar with Marc's work he is a songwriting veteran who just won't quit a creative enigma whose one-of-a-kind style has evolved into a winding rambling non sequitur ease of experiences travels TV shows he likes interactions from sex to cats to David Cassidy to whatever he sees on the news I'm convinced there was not a single thing that Marc could not or would not write the song about in his personal life so regardless of the instrumentals and person on this record I expected at least that much to hold true Here I am happy to say I think that this one is a bit more focused and a bit more consistent than the record it's a sequel to after all at this point 78 minutes is a pretty tight kozilek album I think the mood of this one is a bit more consistent - it's very contemplative occasionally meditative and even at some points feeling as if it's caught in a slightly depressive days in that sense it does share some overlap with marxreisen self-titled record though obviously there's no pressure here to record songs quietly and on the fly in a series of hotel rooms so mark is able to stretch out and explore more organic and lush sound palettes swatches of pianos and drums and vocal harmonies and guitar all of which comes off very rustic very natural as if it's happening right there in front of you you're in the room listening to this thing if you're on a quality pair of headphones for one I love the hypnotic and evenly played piano arpeggios as well as gently picked guitars on the opening track walking in Auckland of course on this record the songs are really more dictated by marks wandering narratives as opposed to a tight melody so expect that though it's something I find enjoyable if Mark is going on about something intriguing funny or even insightful I think the instrumental fits marks story really well in that it seems like a soundtrack to grogginess starting your day really slowly because you had a very late night narrative Lee mark is going over the previous night's events in his head as if it's all happening in slow motion as he describes himself in the moment he barely even feels awake there it's like he's just caught in this emotionally numb tired stupor all the time he's at the hotel getting breakfast planning to go back to his room and then he has a very odd exchange with some front desk person who's yelling at him you're spilling water everywhere you're spilling water Mark's confused he doesn't know where the water's coming from he's saying there's no water there's misunderstanding there's yelling there's cussing it seems like a very Curb Your Enthusiasm type of interaction not only that but the instrumental switch up at this point in the song to display the tension of the moment reminds me of summer modest mouse with the guitars and the lp vocals after this interaction though mark enters back into this daze he was previously in displaying his life in a way where it is ever shifting never settling very compartmentalized this type of commentary he had made at length on a couple of tracks on this is my dinner not too long ago the song LaGuardia is similarly relaxed and weary occasionally transitioning into these very tense passages of guitar loops and pianos and what sounds like tiny little rhythmic claps the narrative on this one isn't as compelling and I find the ascending piano chords that are quite fragmented to be a little stony and the only interesting thing I found to be in this track were the celebrity musings in the second half where mark goes off on Michael Jackson saying that on earlier song where he was thrashing him critics panned it but now after leaving Neverland which he describes having a physical reaction of disgust - everyone seems to be on his side and then there's this really weird monologue about Jeff Buckley saying that he reached out to mark at one time expressed being a fan mark describing himself as having not responded thinking why would he want validation or an interaction from me he's a successful sexy musician with celebrity lovers then making a mental leap to say based off a conversation maybe he was seeking some kind of help or guidance or something like altom Utley the song's message of everyone is insecure everyone has insecurities is true but I find this moment in the song to be oddly presumptuous and just difficult to digest trying to come to any conclusions about Jeff Buckley's personal character or emotional state based off of him simply trying to contact mark kozilek at this point just seems very unfair and weird I mean maybe he was just being cool and nice and friendly personally I get more enjoyment out of the fluid and serene pianos on the following the artists which given the titles track doesn't exactly play out in the way that you expect it to as mark lyrically is going into deep detail about every procedural move executed by a sandwich maker basically being wowed by this person's sandwich-making ability and calling him an artist which is a pretty cool moment in the track an interesting passage but then we go into an exchange with a taxi driver talking about how people are engrossed in their smartphones the track detours and detours and detours from there and it's not exactly riveting or enchanting for the full 11 minutes though it does top things off with very beautiful and passionate ending I think the lowest point on the record though that just would not grow on me no matter how many times I listened to it was chart enchilada personally I don't really get that much out of Mark going into great detail about enchiladas and a charred enchilada and how weird a charred enchilada is and I guess just his appreciation for that and then transitioning into a diatribe about how bassoons and bassoon players are not cool though I do find it very funny that this passage finishes off with an instrumental flourish that is led by of course a bassoon Mark you are very funny in the final leg of the record comes one of my favorites here my brother loves seagulls which instrumentally and narrative Lee resembles a track from Sun Kil moons Benji I love the beautiful and calming finger picked nylon guitar notes on this one I can just sink into them meanwhile mark is going on about his connection to his brother or lack thereof and the song essentially reaches a progression where he is reaching out to him calling him just trying to get back in touch because work and life and music and everything is kind of distracting and getting in the way and the song just expresses that need to make that again connection once more nice to hear that despite this distance because of things going on around them there is still that love and support there meanwhile on where's Gilroy this track is a slow plucky acoustic cut that builds up to a diatribe on gun violence where after filing through some everyday occurrences mark gets hit with news of that garlic festival shooting in Gilroy last year and there's this sense of confusion and even a feeling of being upset from him and maybe even some other people mentioned in the song when people are talking about well where where is even this place these things are happening in places we don't even know or understand or can find on a map have a connection to so that shooting in the news of an interim it's life in a way but everything goes on as normal immediately after which in a way I think is a commentary regular life continues while I do think that bringing up things like Columbine to say this is nothing new is kind of talking past the issue because it doesn't acknowledge the fact that there has been an uptick in these sorts of events still I do think it is essential to frame that America does have a very long and violent history that this sort of plays into the larger context of the song August night is a somewhat odd closer for the record it wouldn't be a mark kozilek album if there wasn't a super meta moment and that is essentially this I mean it kind of reaches an apex at a point where mark is commenting on his own vocal harmonies mid-song and even going on about the length of the record as we near the finish of the track which features a short exchange with a door-to-door Mormon evangelizing giving him a picture of Jesus mark is essentially telling me he's not interested in a very friendly way and we don't get deep into this interaction before the track just just cuts off just ends very abruptly very hard end certainly one of the more unique finishers to a mark kozilek work I'll say that but I'm not sure if I feel all that drawn to return to it as I felt it didn't really have one of the stronger progressions of any of the tracks here and essentially it did come off a little anticlimactic so I will say I do think this record is better than the first time a few years ago these three cross paths but I only ended up loving about half the record and I think that boils down to a handful of issues there are so many tracks on this thing that I don't find to be all that engaging all that tuneful really all that memorable as Mark is taking me down themes and ideas and narratives that he's kind of explored before in ways that I guess had more impact in the past Mark's work recently with it being as unique as it is has been compared to a lot of things that are outside of the musical realm whether that be a book or a journal or a podcast or a movie but this time around his narratives to me felt like I was playing some kind of world game where I've completed all the objectives and now I'm just cycling around the same familiar ideas again and again and again and again and I'm not so much listening to his records at this point to hear a song or hear him I guess expand my mind with anything I'm just hearing them too I guess like get a bit of an update on what's going on with him almost as if I was holding a phone call with the guy which I guess could make for a more compelling album if the whole thing felt a bit brighter tighter more melodic more focused more clever I do commend him for doing what he does in the style that he does it for as long as he's been doing it but at this point how can I not feel at least a little bit like he's kind of running this into the ground even if a few good tracks come out of it even if nobody else is daring enough to do it feeling a strong 5 to a light six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the

_O0UrJG9J0A,ah hi everyone Anthony sail tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new trippy red mixtape a love letter to you for this is the newest mixtape from rapper and singer trippy red the fourth installment of his a love letter to you series obviously and as far as rapper crooners go I have historically expressed quite a bit of faith in trippy red when it comes to speeding to the head of the pack making an impact on the emote rap genre he certainly seems to be on track with that with this tape set to do a hundred K this week however I've not really been all that excited about the man's recent output especially his new exclamation point record that dropped earlier this year which was easily the most low effort and just thrown together batch of songs the man has put his name on so far I don't know what creatively drove trippy red to this point but it was kind of a shock so much so that it's got me looking skeptically at this 21 track mixtape thinking how much effort did you really put into this very lengthy batch of songs nothing tells me you've put in the forethought to make any of these tracks have a shelf life longer than a year or even six months and do rappers at this point even expect their most hardcore fans to sit through these hour-long 20 track projects I went into this tape hoping that maybe trippy red would go back to basics a little bit given that this is part of an ongoing series that he is pretty well known for and give us a series of songs doing what we know just works emotional numbers trap bangers overly emotional singing sticky melodies catchy flows the opening track on this thing larae is not a very good omen though it sounds like a breakup text set to acoustic guitars loaded with all these fake deep quotables meant to make the other person feel like they're stupid for ending the relationship assuming it's their fault that ended it's not easy to sit through honestly and what's to come after this track is basically a mixed bag of snoozers losers bangers and anthems and tons and tons and tons of features to sum head-turners ynw Mele is on here post his incarceration which is pretty crazy and at the of all for me it sounds like there's this lengthy rambley vocal snippet from xxx tenth Osseo where he's kind of rambling on about his difficulties with I guess just being loved being in a relationship caring too much if you find that mindset sort of relatable even considering the person it's coming from but beyond that the feature list here is a gauntlet of basically whoever is hot at the moment to baby young boy lo mozi juice world which unfortunately I think speaks to a certain disposability when it comes to a lot of newer music which I think we're now just accepting as normal these very short shelf-life records with these feature lists that go in and out of fashion like seasonal wardrobes I will say the first leg of this tape starts off pretty focused though in true trippy red fashion with a lot of heart broken vocals and acoustic guitars and trap beats we have a song about wanting love we have a song about hating and not wanting love on the first leg of this tape trippy sounds more comfortable in this Lane than ever but that is also part of the problem because I think this puts trippy in a place where he is now just painting by the numbers delivering fans merely what they expect not expounding on these feelings or emotions in any way whatsoever granted who needs love does go pretty hard again it is a love rejection anthem with trippy openly embracing his single status the lyrics while they are pretty surface level they do sound like they come from a genuine place not so much the case for lovesick though whose constant references to forgetting what I said just feels like volunteering yourself for gaslighting not to mention the firework samples and the dramatic singing remind me of something off of Drake's first record - the hooks on love me more in real feel are pretty sharp but the verses are completely devoid of anything memorable not to mention the trap beat acoustic guitar combo is growing pretty stale at this point this emo trapped wave I don't even think is five years old and already we're running this instrumental style into the ground thankfully there are some welcome change ups with all the features to follow past this point this ain't that is certainly a highlight with some sparkling guitar peji O's and smooth bass sound tracking what is trippi's most effortlessly catchy hook in a while those saying that for real the saying that for real honestly I don't even mind the mediocre Lowell mozi feature in the second half six kiss by comparison is a much tougher listen though Meli's feature sounds completely tacked on juice worlds miniature versus nothing to write home about and then trippy pulls on some of the weirdest movie references that I think I've heard him drop in a while from Coraline to Megamind and also mentioning Optimus Prime yeah I can do without all that especially since trippy similes here are pretty boring the song ends with little yah T and P airborne sounds like a bad leftover from little yachties last record and on the track all for me smoke purp is so slathered in auto-tune he sounds absolutely ridiculous there are a lot of mediocre less than stupendous moments on this tape honestly I feel like all that's worth mentioning is the handful of highlights that happen past this point we have sickening with Tory Lanez which features some great pianos a little woodwind melodies too easily one of the more elegant moments on the tape trippi's refrains on the track of I don't feel too well a pretty hilarious considering the title of the song and lyrically he constantly references being sick or just sicknesses so I guess in a way it's one of the more focused songs here and then Tory Lanez feature goes a lot harder than I would have expected emotionally speaking so when he pops in it's not a lull or anything like that the Grinch is a very short hyper aggressive banger with more production from Pierre it's one of the wilder songs on here I wish there were more tracks that took this tone definitely would have made for a more fun experience but the moment that we have it is pretty good we have death featuring to baby while it is not one of his better features I've heard this year an appearance from the baby is always a bit of a pick-me-up on a project like this though the very nasty three 6 mafia's sample on this track goes a long way too with the trap beat and the club' synths on the instrumental it's a good vibe we also have bust-out featuring you've d considering the gorgeously melodic since on this track and the wonderful change-up on the chorus this has to be one of the tracks that has the most forethought on this tape because rarely on this project does a hook have this much contrast as a hook pop out this much I wish there were more tracks on this thing that had this level basic structure also you've D kind of one of the better features on the project a French rapper I wasn't aware of up until this point and he's really a breath of fresh air in this tracklist his delivery is pretty tight and his voice has a very distinct quality to it what also popped out was little wop on the jungle book and while I've never really been a huge lil wop fan up until this point his incredibly raspy delivery is cartoonish hilarious he sounds like twenty-one savage with a bronchial infection seriously though his very short appearance at the front end of this song definitely is attention-grabbing lyrically trippy goes at length throughout the rest of the track too definitely one of his more aggressively delivered sets of verses so that's that's a standout to the finish of the tape ends on a somewhat strong note with the acoustic abandoned and the boom bap ish can you rap like me we're trippy shows he can flow with old heads even if his pen game isn't the best now as much as I enjoy these tracks of course they are not enough to carry this hour-long project into a positive score because a majority of the material here is not all that great it's not memorable and all-in-all this project serves as a reminder that this is the current state of the music industry where songwriting barely matters just get a vibe get kind of a hook and a beat that sort of goes and you have a song just get it out there and maybe by some sort of fluke it'll hit at the very worst it'll get some streams on your massively long record and look I don't deny that there are artists out there including trippy red that this formula is working for but the problem is this formula is too easy to replicate and as a result of that you're not really leaving a mark a long lasting mark on your audience and it's going to be easy one day for another person to do exactly what you're doing and just step in your place records like this don't really foster long-term loyalty and you know what I hope I'm wrong about that I hope I'm wrong feeling a decent too strong for on this one transition have you given this tape a listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the life you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell is well over next to my head is another video that you

fC94rzgHF3M,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another edition of our y-you know review series where I go over a series of Records that I did not get a chance to review in this month and now I'm going over them in brief gauntlet style in this video just to get my thoughts out there on some projects that I thought were worth mentioning that I thought were worth addressing just couldn't really you know do a full length review on them you know what it is at this point because we do this every month so let's get right into it above am the new Wilco record is not a bad addition to the band's catalogue basically the group comes through with another batch of tracks that are a very melancholic hushed indie folk music that they help make this sound the style what it is today so how could you not admire the band for sticking to their guns in my opinion this one's sadder and dreary er than any other album Wilco has dropped this decade especially in comparison with schmell Co which was a little rough around the edges freewheeling wild sometimes silly for Wilco which I thought it was kind of cool they were letting loose on this record this album is very much going back in the other direction it is very grey it is very dejected some solid tunes on this one here and there but for the most part that sadness that seems to be permeating every corner of this record or at least what feels like sadness it doesn't come off as all that potent I think it's a bit one-dimensional while in one breath I admire this record it's consistency I wish it was just a bit more versatile new record from guitarist and songwriter extraordinaire Santana I was pretty excited to get deeper into it once I heard some clips and a few tracks from it given that it seems like it's it's a return to form honestly to some of the more jazz fusion sounds that Santana was known for back in the day but now he's bringing in some elements of afro funk afro jazz which is great but I can't help but feel as I listen more to this one it just lacks the finesse of Santana's best works from the 70s while I admire the musical fusion that he's going for here and it's definitely the best thing this album has going for it in terms of the rhythms in terms of the guitar solos I just think it could all be a bit tighter when talking about a genre like jazz fusion I happen to feel like tightness as well as incredible chemistry between all the musicians involved is pretty significant and I'm just not hearing it to the extent that I would like to on this record some points of it just feel a little clunky a lot of the group vocals almost feel tacked on not seamlessly woven into the rest of the instrumentation I admire what Santana was trying to do on this record it's certainly a welcome change of pace from his more commercial works over the past decade or so but can't say this this one really did it for me new mayhem record I think is fine I don't really have any major criticisms about it other than it's you know pretty by the numbers a few tracks here and there are especially vicious and standout as a result of that but for the most part it's a pretty meat-and-potatoes black metal release at this point not sure if there's really anything else to add if you are a traditionalist if you just want to hear black metal in its most straightforward form without I guess too low fiber recording give it a shot new omni record networker a relatively new band whose record over here is dropping via sub pop that's how I found out about them that and some of the teaser material from this thing that read as some very herky-jerky angular frenetic somewhat spastic old-school post-punk kind of love that sound and the more I heard omni tried to pursue it the more it felt like they were sort of capturing that old-school aesthetic but the songwriting and the playing where i'm not really anything to write home about while I understand that trying to rekindle this sound requires quite a bit of talent I feel like the band didn't really put much of their own twist on it or go above and beyond to enhance it or anything a handful of good songs on it and if you're just nostalgic for this era of post-punk music give it a try but outside of that I couldn't really find anything else to just throw praise on to with this one the new Jeffrey Lewis and the voltage record which has some pretty decent lowest songs on especially LPS which is an amazing record collectors anthem if you are a vinyl head you will absolutely love some of the stuff that Jeff is saying on this track he is as funny and as clever as ever on at least the first leg of the album then there is an interlude cut where I think kind of I guess marks a change in sound quality because in my opinion a lot of the tunes and the second half are nowhere near as funny or as memorable or as lyrically bold so I don't know to me it's really kind of a tale of two halves one half that I really enjoy the other half that very much pales in comparison and that just is what it is I guess but if you love your punk music with a bit of folk or you love your folk music with a bit of punk and you love very verbose wordy heady songs give Jeffrey Lewis a shot especially if you have no idea who this guy is because he's very much underrated techno technician techno wizard Andy Stott he is back with a new collection of tracks which is being billed as a double EP and the material here is I guess his slowest space east batch of songs yet it's like he's trying to make his little noise and bring his little speed into the equation as possible the experience is definitely unique from any other Andy Star record I would say it's unique in comparison to really most technically a novel idea a cool approach a different angle unexpected but I I'm really not getting that much out of it for me it just sounds underwhelming I wish there was more of a groove or I wish there were more sounds just filling up these empty spaces to make it more of a I guess enveloping more ambient experience the new girlfriend of the year record with its short synthetic abstractions about like TV shows the track about spongebob is hilarious in a way listen this might just be one of the worst albums of the year but there is something about it that makes me wonder if this is like the future of music as we know it Plus how could you not want to try something with this album cover this album covers something Frank Ocean collaborator vegan is that how you pronounce this this artist named vegan I'm assuming so well vegan is a pretty talented and versatile producer can't say after listening to this record though that I'm hearing much in terms of like compositional or songwriting talent I mean that can certainly be honed or more song structures can be brought in to make this collection of songs more impactful but for the most part what I'm hearing here just feels like a loose collection of rough ideas motifs and sketches many of which are really cool but outside of that I'm having a hard time really enjoying or finding more praise for this record because everything while there are some cool ideas thrown out here and there it's all just so fleeting the new wiki record given some of the teaser tracks is one I was very excited to listen to however ended up being disappointed by how uneventful a lot of the deeper cuts on this thing are sad to say it's really the singles that ended up being the most interesting on the album there are some cool beats here in there and he picked some good guests throughout the tracklist too but there are so many moments where I feel like the song writing is just underwhelming we're forgettable wikis flows or verses are just okay kind of standard for him nothing all too new or groundbreaking or I guess exciting I mean if you're the type of person who has to hear everything going on in the New York underground I would say give it a listen but it's it's not gonna stick out to you any more than I think the best stuff the city has to offer every year I get a question or two about the Claypool Lennon delirium and I'm yet to really formally review a project from this duo and I am kind of shocked because I feel like I would be just chomping at the bit to do such a thing because of this meeting of the minds here I mean Sean Lennon and one of my favorite musicians of all time Les Claypool collaborating on an entire record of songs but I'm just yet to hear a project from them that to me feels reflective of their unique talents I feel almost like when they get together on a record they cancel each other out in a way not only that but I feel like vocally Sean Lennon and les claypool obviously they disagree and fans of this project disagree and that's fine but I I just think they're oil and water man I just do not get what exactly these guys do with each other that they either couldn't do separately or they think is so incredible that they they couldn't possibly make it in any other context with anyone else that it must be made I just really must be going over my head or something because I'm yet to hear anything out of this very psych revivalist you know collection of tracks the new one I'm talking about that it really just kind of speaks to me I mean it's a little zany but the songs are subpar in my opinion sometimes it comes off a little grating obnoxious and with Lennon and Claypool constantly switching off there's just so little consistency to the whole thing so I don't know it's cool that they're doing it and they're together and I commend them for sticking with what they're doing here but I just get so little out of it the new floating points album given some of what I heard prior to the release I was pretty psyched to hear it but then ended up being a little underwhelmed by the overall experience as it pretty much just feels like very inoffensive so so IDM kind of groovy kind of linear a few interesting synthetic textures here and there but you know nothing really blown me away hmm Josh hommies the desert sessions is back after quite a while with a short little record with who knows I mean he's working with like just about anybody who will walk into the studio and has a bit of a profile on this record which i think is kind of unique about this project it's a fun cool interesting thing about this project it's amazing that he's able to pull all these sessions together and make what happens happen on you know these desert session records but creatively it's all over the place songwriting wise it's very inconsistent especially like that tweeting song on the back end is like ten shades of terrible and and frankly the more I listen to this the more I'm just wondering where is this wild eccentric fun colorful attitude when it comes to Queens record villains because that album was like one-dimensional as fuck and so sonically gray that it lacked character a character that I think turns up on this record just hope hope I hear it on the next Queens I guess nuke I wished an album producer who I have reviewed on this channel in the past on his chi Whiston bitch record also that new collaborative project with baby and his boy igloo ghost hearing what he's doing on this record I can see why there's a lot of excitement for it I can see why there's a massive amount of hype for it I could see why people are finding it interesting and there are a good handful of songs especially in the first leg that I personally think are great where Kai is drifting away from some of the trap that he's known for infusing some of those elements with more wondrous organic instrumentation it hits hard yet it's also pretty but then there's a point where he diverges from this fusion of styles entirely and just starts trying to reverse-engineer as a solo electronic music producer with some guests here and their experimental rock music post rock music a little bit of I guess art or indie rock as well and I just feel like the results pale in comparison to anything that is so obviously a point of reference and influence for him on this record like I would rather much rather listen to a Godspeed song or and any number of experimental or post rock artists who he's just trying to copy on this essentially it's certainly admirable that he took this risk whit in this direction this certainly seems to be paying off amongst his fans who are very enamored with the project and didn't expect someone of Kai's caliber to drop an album like this I didn't expect him to drop an album like this frankly I think there are few electronic music producers out there who would feel bold enough to do so and I also think it's very cool that this record is reflective of Kai's obviously diverse tastes but does he recreate and embody these sounds in a way where I just enjoy them within the context of this record not really All Things Considered the new blood incantation project is a pretty good death metal record it has a great recording very heavy very brutal very crushing but everything rings through so clear the vocals the guitars the bass the drums really everything sonically and compositionally the band is a bit more progressive than your average death metal group some of the riffs and playing or a bit technical some of the song structures are winding and in really add to the flavor of these tracks and yet they never veer too far away from that classic and morbid sound now is every riff on this record great in my opinion not really and I think the 18 minute closing track is a bit convoluted and could have easily been broken down into a few different parts but still the material on here that is good is very good and I think is worth checking out for any metal fan really even someone who may be just curious about death metal and just looking to get a good example of how the genre sounds and in what its genetic makeup is I have been returning and returning and returning to this new Hot Chip record for months now really because it's it's been out for so long and honestly every time I listen to it it just feels more and more underwhelming less of it really sticks with me I'm just not really sure I mean Hot Chip has has never truly been one of my favorite indie tronic or synth pop bands but I've always thought they had plenty of catchy material throughout their discography and I'm just not finding that to be the case on this new record over here I just thought it was very bland and their most forgettable record yet ition and that is the why you know review for this month all of the projects that I talked about are listed down below over here next to my head is another video that you could

VkMov0H8QRA,hi everyone keeping it together here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Coldplay album everyday life this is a new full-length record from the world famous platinum selling rock band Coldplay they are back with their eighth full-length album it is a two-parter in 16 tracks that somehow comes in under an hour I'm gonna be honest with you this decade for Coldplay creatively I think has been pretty dismal Mylo ghost stories dreams not the band's best stuff and sure there's been a lot of commercial success and versatility and it looks like the band is doing well but the last album Coldplay drop that actually meant anything to me came out in 2008 so I went into this new record really hoping for the band to end things on a high note with this decade which was kind of easy it was easy going into this project with high hopes given the ambitious double album thing given teaser tracks like arabesque a groovy horn backed Jam expressing this sort of humanitarian oneness you could be me I could be you essentially asking the listener to put themselves in the shoes of people who they may fear or hate or think less of and not just this track but this entire record feels like a reaction to the incredibly intense and divisive times that we live in but also it lacks the equipment or maybe even the will to discuss the root causes of war and inequity and poverty and extremism so essentially Coldplay supplants a focus on real world problems and solutions for allusions to friendship a higher power nostalgia and a whole bunch of musical detours that just make this entire record feel like a crapshoot like on cry cry cry a piano back piece of vocal pop with a vintage flare sounds like it's something straight out of the 50s or 60s but now just coming out of an expensive studio today with some chipmunk background vocals that are really awkward doesn't really say much lyrically and the ending totally fizzles out for the most part it just feels like a random detour a total non song hit of Soma to distract from this records lack of core material and the odds and ends in the tracklist here continue especially on the second half a sudden elegant piano piece topped with a Persian poem that arrives after a very weird instrumental transition or the song broken a one-off gospel number complete with chorus of singers and finger snaps some humble piano - while it's on it's okay nothing horrible about it but ultimately it's another detour with a fizzled ending and a lack of reinforcement of everything that's going on around it the song guns that kicks off the second half is a fast and folky number maybe the most gripping and lyrically radical song of the bunch with some references to revolution and how our country politically prioritizes guns the singing and guitar playing on the track are great but the songs brevity leaves it feeling like a footnote amongst all of these bland non statements which the song also is sort of as well even though it's packed with more social commentary than many other tracks here these comments really fail to come together into any sort of focused statement I guess there are also songs here that just feel very off the mark like echo with its really pristine acoustics and its idealization of Africa as if it's just one big country singing about big rivers and African mothers taking this very assuring tone like everything's gonna be alright I'm not really sure about this one I feel like this is what you would get if you made Asura from Vampire Weekend right the most tone-deaf song he could even more tone-deaf is the single orphans which I didn't think too much of at first outside of it just sounding like a very dreamy arena rock ballad Ally u2 with its course about missing your youth and wanting to get drunk with your friends it doesn't seem like too much on the surface but it gets really awkward looking into the lyrics so the verses and the deeper meaning of the song as I guess they're inspired by refugees of the 2018 Damascus bombing in which case why is the danger these people are in their struggle to exist being juxtaposed against this chorus of no I fail to see the parallel here like what is the connection the matically if you just stare at the lyrics there doesn't really seem to be one what does this first world desire to gain your youth just ponder your youth and drink with your friends have to do with like not dying due to the misfortune of being born into a warzone I think it's really frankly stupid to portray their desires as just being like hey I want to know when I can drink with my friends in those moments I think their material needs and desires should be portrayed with a bit more accuracy not just some bomb-ass sing-along party course the band tosses in to make the song appealing for a pop audience and look there are definitely a handful of well-written well-structured and satisfying songs in the tracklist here arabesque champion of the world also trouble in town whose first leg sounds like a very low-key beautiful ballad that could have been on ghost stories but then it transitions into this gorgeous crescendo kicked off with a vocal snippet that sounds pretty Pink Floyd esque but this handful of tracks does not outweigh the immense amount of what sounds like filler on this record I'm sorry but there's no way that Coldplay could dig this record out of the mediocre rut it's in with more electronic classical gospel or whatever kind of detours everyday life is just a very well produced but unfocused album with a pretty incomplete message it's kind of woke on the surface but just as distracting and inconsequential as anything else the mainstream might want in front of your face feeling a light to decent 5 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Coldplay forever 
wsu8XzmeOYg,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new have a nice life album sea of worry this is the third full-length LP from dan barrett and tim mokuba's have a nice life a connecticut music project that somehow gained this incredible cult status after the release and slowly snowballing a claim of the 2008 album death consciousness with its 90 minute runtime fusing elements of post-punk with industrial music with drone with goth rock with low fine music shoegaze it's a pretty dark murky and soul-crushing listen with this heavy and raw sense of dread hanging over nearly every minute of the album in a way that was pretty unparalleled in the late 2000s by that virtue alone it's easy to hear why this stood out in the underground in the way that it did also why it's retained so much relevance over the years so since the release of death consciousness have a nice life output has been sporadic sure Tim and especially Dan have stayed busy with their own lives and side projects but the only other have a nice life album we have the speak of is the very good follow-up in 2014 the unnatural world and now see of worry which just dropped this month so given how rare have a nice life albums are and how good the first two records were I went into the third LP with pretty high expectations even if I wasn't all that crazy about the teaser tracks because with have a nice life there's a high probability that on first or even second listen you're gonna miss things because of the typically low fire recording experimental mixing layers of atmosphere and noise but with more and more listens through the seven tracks presented here sadly I found no such magic or even inner workings or details that really turn to this record around for me and in my opinion see of worry is by a mile the most stale and unimaginative project have a nice life has given us yet if there are two things that have really defined the appeal of the first to have a nice life record so far they are some pretty evocative sound play and also a seamless blend of dark experimental music genres that are just pulled together in such a way where it's hard to tell where one influence starts and another begins and it feels like neither of these things show up on see of worry as this record is just so painfully obvious which is made pretty clear by the opening track the title track of the record sea of worry what is this track it's a generic surf rock beat topped with some spooky whaling guitars very washed out and distant lead vocals that have kind of a snotty punkish tone and delivery to them it sounds like the breakout single from a gimmicky goth rock band that dresses like the Beach Boys while they have skeleton masks on or something I don't know the song writing is pretty formulaic the sound play is not all that exciting it's way more surface level than anything I would expect from a have a nice life record and I can't say the lengthier Dracula bells is that much better sure by comparison it's a more noisy abrasive and experimental track that works in numerous parts but very little of these parts land especially in the first section which features a horrendous drumbeat it's a kick snare snare with a rickety-ass hi-hat on every single quarter note the number of drum sets I've ever been behind in my life I can probably count on two hands and I can play this beat and I don't mean that it's a super simple cute little groovy beat that you might get out of a Meg white performance or a mode Tucker performance no it's just really stiff and boring and lifeless the dreary guitar intervals playing over the speed get pretty tedious too sure there's some pretty nice chord and melody change ups on the hook of the track but it's really not enough to save the song and then there's a portion where we suddenly break into this darker heavier more rhythmic and industrial passage with some buzzing bass some twisted lead vocals to cacophonous embellishments of piano and guitar kind of sounds like a paler version of something I might have heard on the new daughter's record and I'd like to say I enjoy the noisy crescendo that the track arrives to at the very end but the icy very synthetic I can't even describe them splashy scent passages that play over this wall of noise horrendous aesthetically they don't compliment anything going on underneath them and the way that they're mixed into the track they really overpower everything in an awkward way the song science B tones things down quite a bit by comparison and is another moment on the record that feels very out of character for have a nice life the track mostly sounds like a very anonymous New Wave demo from decades and decades ago with too much reverb on it we have some rigid and very sparse drums on this thing lightly pulsating bass then some faint tones that are so quiet it's difficult to make out exactly what they are part of the time guitars since the vocals are even more difficult to get a grasp of and I don't just mean lyrically which is typically the case for a have a nice life record but also melodically emotionally if the point of this track is for everything on it to be barely present then I would say mission accomplished now there is a passage in the second half where everything gets a little bit louder the guitars have a lot more presence than they did previously but it's it's really too little too late by this point the tracks grown stale at least for me and the progression it's arrived to is not all that gratifying we then have trespassers w-which kicks off with a guitar riff that shouldn't have been left on whatever Danko Jones or alkaline trio or hives record it was found on because I can't really say this but rocking riff really helps sea of worries case it mostly just sounds like an awkward attempt at being hooky while also failing to appreciate that the songs washed out production and ghostly aesthetic doesn't really do all that much for these forcefully vocals and fist-pumping riffs the song everything we forget is genuinely one of the few mums here that really feels like I have a nice life track that could fit on the two previous records feels like it's in their wheelhouse it's a layered and strange ambient piece that feels pretty massive there's so much going on and there's so much sound bleed happening it's difficult to make out every detail but it's like I'm hearing all of these cycling synthetics set against ghostly chorus vocals and maybe some strings either way it's equal parts gorgeous and unsettling even if at a forum in a runtime the whole thing is a bit breezy the sadly the record doesn't really pick up from here next we get a very sloppy loaf I piece of post-punk the instrumentation never really seems to coalesce into anything all that gripping it mostly just ends up being a noisy mess as the mix of the track just gets more and more distorted it's like a self-serious bass boost meme is it super abrasive yes but is it dynamic or texturally interesting not really it's like if a goth rock band with way too much reverb had about the same recording quality as like that 2009 waves record I assumed the closing track would be a pretty grand finale given its 13 minute runtime but the whole front end is taken up by this audio of what sounds like a television or radio preacher a really boring evangelist type who doesn't really have much to say honestly and don't get me wrong I'm not against the mention of Christianity on a rock record previously I've really enjoyed it especially when post rock bands have included audio of preachers who are really on some fire and brimstone shit but what our friend here is telling us on the tape about the devil and deception and so on and so forth can be heard by just about anybody if you flip on the Christian hour at your local public-access television station the only thing that could make me curious about this audio is if it was revealed that the guy talking is actually Pete Buddha judge and believe it or not there's a few points where their speech patterns are oddly similar once we finally transition into the more musical portion of this track it's okay we get some weary vocal harmonies and glistening pianos and light acoustic guitars I like the fat Dorjee display of instrumentation that comes in after this portion that's a pretty nice transition even if the lead vocals are turned down solo and buried into the mix so deeply it's almost comedic but yeah that's pretty much the end of the album and I gotta say this was rough this was not a very good record from the have a nice life even though it's been 10 years since death consciousness this is not the type of rut I would expect have a nice life to be and not on the third record I'm feeling a strong 32 a light four on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it but which rate

rLCwc_nrimk,hi hi hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week you know what it is this is what it is okay before I get into all these tracks which are linked down there below as usual want a shout out of course our turntable a blank where you can buy a colorful pressing of a record we have reviewed on the channel we get kickback from it and supports the channel supports this segment also our patreon page where you can get access to bonus monthly let's argue patreon only let's argue episodes also monthly classic album listen along live stream listening parties we're doing our next one very soon so hit up the page see what we got over there and finally I want to shout out our little charity vinyl compilation that we did or we put out at the end of October it's only really been out a month now this baby is just a month old that we put out with proceeds going toward the immigrant legal Resource Center there's only a few hundred copies of these left so if you really want to get one hit up the link down below but also keep in mind the remaining couple hundred copies that we have left we are going to put them on sale on Black Friday so get them now or wait and see what of them are left and get them then either way get one this week get one when you can and yeah that's it link down below alright let's get into the worst tracks of the week the worst tracks of the week we have a handful first the new partynextdoor track loyal featuring drake is absolutely mind-numbing ly boring alternative R&B i think it is pretty safe to say at this point that being tossed into the ovo stable has very much like prevented partynextdoor from evolving and progressing in any significant way and now what we're getting is just very very stale really really behind the curve at this point and yeah it's just really unexcited frankly moving out from there Marilyn Manson has seen fit to do a cover of the doors the end and it is about as a long winded and is drawn out as one could imagine I guess with Manson just taking a lot of spatial liberties with the track it's it's really just a devoid of anything interesting for its eight-minute run time and I don't ever want to hear it again for the rest of my life moving out from there the new bad bunny track vete I don't know I cannot stand this man's vocalizations unfortunately they just seem so off to my ears he does not to me come off as like a traditionally great singer I know the dude has a lot of heart and have all the respect in the world for him how he sort of put his public image on the line and some of the Puerto Rico protests and kind of going down there and doing his thing down there and showing support and solidarity for for those fighting for a better life and a better government in the country but having said all that I cannot die I cannot get into this song over here as much as much as I do fuck with this man's you know haircut we're on the more on the bald wave but but once more I just cannot really get into this track outside of the the beat goes kind of hard but the singing I just cannot moving out from there a new Kalani track you know us up which really really could use more of a strong melody more of a structure for the most part she just seems to be sing ranting over a very generic somewhat smooth and pillowy instrumental and really just like kind of complaining about a relationship that she doesn't really seem to be getting as much out of as she would like outside of that there's not really a whole lot about the song that feels all that compelling but what are you gonna do alright tracks I felt kind of met on wasn't blown away by them but thought they were still worth pointing out one a new track from Isis ami who is an artist who I've talked about before in this series she has a new record out the drop this year that I think is okay she also has a new EP a holiday themed EP out will Little Drummer BB and a few tracks from it are floating around the internet right now it's you is a very quaint piece of drum machine back bedroom pop that is somewhat low five is still very pretty and a little melancholic give it a try give it a shot next we have a new track from Maggie Rogers a singer and songwriter who's a new recent record I didn't really get that much out of however with this a new song of hers over here love you for a long time it kind of seems like a 90s singer-songwriter throwback radio jam that's not too bad the vocals are still not very all that distinct but still not all that distinct but but still it's it's sweet on the ears it's nice on the ears a hit of slight nostalgia for me personally oh damn alright next a new track from singer and songwriter Maggie Rodgers whose new LP I didn't care for all that much but this new single of hers love you for a long time has a bit of a throwback 90s singer-songwriter radio jam quality to it that I liked quite a bit vocals still a little generic but the tune is nice the tune is sweet we also have new track from eddy currents oppression ring Australian garage rock band very linear song over here some vocals that are pretty straightforward almost narrative in tone the lyrics feel kind of political little revolutionary that quality about the track that I like but I thought that the writing the performance of the progression of the song was a little tedious and repetitive we have destroyer out with a new track where I do like some of the lyrics I do like some of the vocals but like with the other teaser from his upcoming record have we met this new song also feels like it could use more progression it needs more interesting instrumental backdrop it just doesn't happen is the title of it and again while there are some lyrical and vocal ideas presented here that I thought were pretty cool overall the song does get a little tedious and let's get into the best tracks of the week starting with Anderson PAC and Mark Ronson coming together on this track then there were two which is a song from the new spies and disguise Disney animated film soundtrack wouldn't really be covering this or making a big deal of this if it weren't for the fact that Anderson PAC and Mark Ronson are a duo that has long been overdue and the song comes out fucking excellent I hope that this is the start of a beautiful friendship because given Mark Ronson's pedigree the stuff he was able to do back in the day with artists like Amy Winehouse and given the era of sounds and influences that Anderson pack seems to typically pull from in his own music I feel like Anderson and Mark are just a match made in heaven these two need to do okay this is this whole if this video exists for any reason it's to put this message out into the world okay these two need to do an entire record together get in the fucking studio and do an entire record because if even half of it comes out as good as this song it would have been worth it so there you go that's my idea that's my opinion let's go and next we have a brand new song from English producer electronic music producer mr. Square pusher who has been on a bit of a hiatus a bit of an album hiatus for a while now seems like we are getting a new record very soon the title of this one over here is war track and it's easily one of the glitchy ax stand most mind-bending singles I think Tom Jenkinson has dropped in a long time somebody who is a big fan of a lot of square pushers older stuff I am digging this one quite a bit we have a new track from storm Z as well rapper singer-songwriter storm Z he has a new record on the way the people are making a big big big big big deal of he has this latest cut this latest single out with burna boy as well as Ed Sheeran and yeah I actually enjoy it the edge here and feature is not too bad I think burna boy does well on the track I think the instrumental is fantastic I think storm Z also kicks these start off really well yeah I don't really have much negative about this song to say I dug it i fucks with it i like it quite a bit despite the fact that i wasn't really all that into the poppier in more commercial direction of his last full length record i will be looking forward to this new one quite a bit you know could be a could be a great one could really blow me away we'll see all right we also have rena saw amma coming through with a brand new single STFU and it is yet another example of a new current day bright shining star cutting-edge pop artist who is incorporating elements of new metal and groove metal into their sound i don't have any reason to believe that this is like everything rena is going to be doing for the next record or two records or whatever but this single on its own is really aggressive its bombastic it's in your face it's catchy features some quality vocals heavy production good riffing so uh yeah don't go quite a bit Reena STFU check it out it's a fun fun single alright Ozzy Osbourne straight to hell yes Ozzy is back with a really fuckin good new track with a sound and a production style that is very much in the vein of the dozens if not hundreds of sludge and stoner metal bands that Black Sabbath has influenced over the years because it sounds almost as if the guitars and the drums on this thing are off of like a sleep or a high on fire record which is not a bad sound this is not a bad sound it's heavy as hell it hits hard Ozzy's lyrics are about essentially drug abuse and drug addiction so it's pretty you know in his wheelhouse of knowledge and he writes from very compelling place you know given his past and yeah just generally it's a very great track I liked it a lot more than the last track that Ozzy dropped very recently that one felt a lot more sterile even if it was a pretty solid ballad this one is good writing good performance it sounds gnarliest fuck and has a really pretty bridge on it as well so I'm all in all this is a really good it's really good Ozzy track we have a new song from Kesha as well Kesha is back my own dance something essentially about her marching to the beat of her own drum her own direction her own style this is Kesha you did I am woman hear me roar that sort of thing there are a few weird lyrical ideas on here like a don't circumcise I can't even say don't circumcise my circumstance not sure if I'm super crazy about that lyric but generally I think the song is actually really catchy and I think I liked it more than her her last major teaser track so that's it's out there it's weird it's ridiculous it has very funky and an odd way qualities to it but that's that's just kind of Kesha I guess we also have hiam hallelujah brand-new track it is a beautiful acoustic ballad and that in my opinion has some qualities to it that reminds me of the the great work of Nikko Chelsea girl that era maybe also a little bit of simon and garfunkel on this track too it's quite nice and very good singing on it as well so check it out it's solid I want to give a shout out also to Francis Quinlan of hopalong Fame who seems to be on a bit of a solo venture now with this brand new track over here now that I'm back it is a dynamic multifaceted ballad that is not as loud and as in-your-face and and as I guess ever shifting as a lot of those great tracks from Hopalong that indie rock fans love so much but it's a really good creative tune so give it a try give it a shot I also want to give a shout out to this remix from MJ Cole of the flume song rushing back featuring Vera blue great grooves and great basically I apologize a remix reinterpretation re-prep presentation I don't know this film track it's got some great beats on it some colorful production give it a try give it a shot and ooh blood incantation over your death metal band blood incantation they just dropped this new full-length record hidden history of the human race it is a gnarliest fuck death metal record with a bit of a sci-fi twist and the production is heavy and thick and murderous and yet everything rings through so clearly it's not one of those dirty dirty grimy death metal records and yet it's not a super sterile like a tech death record it's a good midpoint you know what I mean there's some great playing there's some good gory details but it's it's not ruined by an overly clean or an overly dirty mix just give it a try it's a good one and a Bill Callahan brand new single out if you could touch her at all and it's just a really good sleepy sad country ballad with some great instrumentation the songwriting is a bit more beefed up than it was in comparison to a lot of the shorter vignette like tracks off the Bills latest record but still that's a good single quality single hell yeah bill Callahan and that has been the weekly track around up everyone a quick one but still some solid recommendations in there hit up the links down below in the description to check out some of the songs that I talked about and what's more that wonderful amazing little charity compilation down below only a couple hundred copies left and what is remaining will be going on sale on the 29th and November 30th ok for a bit of a Black Friday thing ok so link to that down below too and I'll catch you guys in the next video and get the new Fantana weekly track roundup forever 
ckBbj-E0SdA,hi everyone hose and II tell tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Maddie on record good faith this is the newest full-length project from French born songwriter producer electronic musician pop alchemist Maddie on I first heard of his stuff back in 2015 with the release of his debut album adventure the music on that project I wasn't crazy about it mostly just hit me like a very formulaic derivative EDM friendly brand of electro pop don't get me wrong there's some fun euphoric and even epic music packed into this record like the song okay or the track Imperium but be consistently boring vocal guests combined with the overall lack of interesting textures and the very synthetic to the point of sterile sound of these songs put me in a place where I doubted if I would ever be a part of the Madeon fanbase it's been four years since the release of that record though so I thought I would give his new one a fair shot just out of curiosity and a lot of suggestions from you guys of course and it's definitely a trimmer project at 35 minutes the production isn't really any less smooth than it was on the previous record but at least Maddie Ann's use of effects combined with the extra layering he throws into this record it makes for a pretty fantastical listen and the vocal features that are here on this project they fit pretty seamlessly into the album they aren't distracting they don't feel like they're driving a change in tone across the tracklist which makes for a more cohesive listen and not just all of that but the sweet sweet bliss he's able to conjure across this record makes it a cut above its predecessor on the opening track dream dream dream I'm not sure what's more attention grabbing is it the creatively chopped and luscious vocal harmonies or is it the cloudy bursts of enveloping sense that fill the mix with rainbows of color the vocals are a bit sleepy but I do like the robotic processing on them and makes it feel like I'm listening to I don't know an AI get in touch with its programmed emotions I get a similar vibe off the track be fine which even though it has a bolder groove hook your structure still lead vocals are very similar and they're also enhanced with these also gorgeous group vocal sections so at the start of this project already I am impressed more with what I am hearing than I was with any Madi on track so far not to say this project is perfect though there are points at which the vocals just don't really hit all that hard like the utterly forgettable closing track also on the track all my friends where the singing is so unblemished and nearly soulless that it's hard to connect I guess it reminds me of many lead vocal passages from Daft Punk's discovery but if you stripped out anything that was emotionally compelling I do love the dance grooves on the track though the cute little production details Madeon throws in here and there but still talking about the vocals the worst of which I think comes through on the track heavy with hoping which look to be credited to singer and songwriter Audra Mae someone who's worked once I listen to it she does not typically sound like this Madi on must have taken her voice and pitched it down in a way where it has this very awkward weird androgynous quality to it which is something I've heard done well before Dorian fucking Elektra but I can't say that's the case here on all these songs where I'm not crazy about the vocal Madeon is still bringing some instrumental heat some grooves which is also the case for the cuts where he features little vocals or no vocals at all like with the huge horn sections and fat hip hop beats toward the end of hold me just because which to my ears sound like John bel ian if John bel ian wasn't such a snoozefest too bad most of what happens up to this point of this track is a little bland we also have the track mania which is a beautiful arpeggiated synth Odyssey the introduction of the track features this primal drumming a rubbery and whimsical lead melody then we go full throttle with these heavy punchy beats when we're building up with these awesome synth arpeggios toward the finish it feels like I'm just flying up a mountain with my anime crew you know we're just make it stances then there's also the track miracle which features these bright shimmering blasts of group vocals just pitched samples that create this incredible feeling of euphoria it's like the rapture is hitting and I'm being brought up to electro-pop heaven with some slick grooves and tasteful progressions the introduction is another moment that feels a little Daffy Punk inspired with a side of Porter Robinson and a splash of Kanye West especially in the samples and drums and I would say the Kanye influence turns up one more time in a bold way on the track Nirvana after a dramatic vocal intro Madeon hits us with these thunderous drums bright just ringing synthesizers that feel like they're a product of the graduation era of course all of this is enhanced by these repeating vocal samples twittering high hats a hip-hop beat and I think Madeon makes it his own with these very glossy shimmery layers of sense that are very consistent with the bright futuristic and synthetic aesthetic most of this record shoots for so I love that Madi on on this record is able to effectively show off so many influences in a very obvious way while simultaneously creating a listen on this record that has a strong sense of identity to it that to me says hey it's fantastic that Madeon has a very strong sense of his artistic self which I still think is a work in progress because while the consistently glossy idyllic and euphoric sound that Madeon brings to the table is nice I don't find it to be all that versatile a lot of tracks on this project really pale in comparison to others especially on the vocal end and once more I think Madi on sound palettes really could use some more texture some shaking up and maybe cast a wider net of influences to pull from next time - overall though I thought this was a decent very likeable electro pop record with some very bright bright bright and feel-good sounds on it I'm feeling a decent - strong six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you

I mean it could go to little nas ex it could go to Liz Oh as well ooh and Rosalia's in here oh my god I would love to see Rosalia win a god damn Grammy that would be great Maggie Rogers no thank you tank and the bangus No Yola I think she's a very good singer but I don't think it's likely she will win same with black Pumas yeah I think it's really down to Billy nas and Liz Oh on this one and once again I think I think Billy is kind of the favorite Best Pop solo performance spirit Beyonce bad guy Billy Eilish seven rings ariana grande truth hurts Liz oh you need to calm down tail Swift I personally would love to see Liz Oh walk away with this one because I mean while I think that um she doesn't have the freshest sound the most buzz of any artist in these categories vocally she's just on another level she has so much personality so much range so much volume so much character to her voice I would love to see her walk away with a Best Pop solo performance on this one with best pop duo and group performance we have ariana grande and social house boyfriend that track is pretty meth in my opinion sucker Jonas Brothers also a pretty mediocre track Old Town Road Billy Ray Cyrus that would be pretty great sunflower post Malone and sway Lee also pretty boring in my opinion seniorita okay that's I wanted to go to Old Town Road please for the love of God let this go to Old Town Road Best Pop Vocal album The Lion King record from Beyonce Billy Eilish thank you next ed Sheeran please do not let it go to Ed Sheeran lover Taylor Swift it's fine but I would rather see Billy or Ariana walk away with this one I do fuck with Beyonce pretty heavy but that Lion King record was not it best dance and electronic music recording linked bonobo that's pretty cool that's great that bonobo got to a nice Grammy not there got to keep on Chemical Brothers which is a somewhat solid record Medusa featuring good boys piece of your heart Rufus to soul underwater Skrillex and Boys Noize featuring ty dolla sign midnight hour gotta say I enjoyed the Chemical Brothers record they're the most I would love to see it go to The Chemical Brothers on that one even though I think it's a likely to go to a newer and trendy artist on this one best dance and electronic album we have LP 5 from apparat the Chemical Brothers hi this is flume mixtape who that blue mixtapes on here that's cool solace Rufus to soul taiko whether would love to see this go to the mixtape frankly would love to see it go to the mixtape then Chemical Brothers I think honestly flu could have a big chance at this one flume is a relatively popular producer in the underground and the mainstream too so I think that could definitely carry over into quite a few votes with this nomination I'm sure there are a lot of people in the industry that love themselves some chemical brothers especially given that a nostalgia factor you can't ignore that but I think flume has a serious shot at this one so pretty excited about that for Best Rock performance pretty waist bones UK gonna have to look that up frankly I have not heard that record this land Gary Clark jr. which was okay history repeats Brittany Howard which I thought had some moments on it woman Karen Owen Danger Mouse too bad rival sons God seriously this is like the most dismal rock performance category in a long time the Brittany Howard again I like some tracks on it I guess I would like to see it go to Brittany Howard I know there are a lot of people in the industry that mess with Alabama Shakes not sure if that is going to make the win here guaranteed though so I guess we'll see with best metal performance we have a Candlemas featuring Tony Iommi we have death angel on here i prevail Killswitch Engage and tool with tempest I guess I prefer the tool track but it would be hilarious to see Killswitch Engage win just for the meme we have the best rock song category fear inoculum give yourself a try harmony hall history repeats this land all respectively from Gary Clark jr. Brittany Howard Vampire Weekend the 1975 and tool I'm okay with all of these tracks I'm not super crazy about any of them I guess again Brittany Howard history repeats that track would be pretty cool fear inoculum i think would be great see tool walk away with an award even if I think that track is a little bland harmony Hall is is fun as well I'll just say harmony Hall and I'll say that honestly I think it's likely Vampire Weekend might get it so Best Rock album now ammo bring me the horizon social cues Cage the Elephant in the other cranberries I prevail trauma rival sons feral roots I guess I would like to see it go to bring me the horizon or Kade's the elephant's I think those two records are probably the most solid and creative of the bunch s alternative music album UFO F big thief it's it's cool to see big thief here it would be amazing to see them win especially considering I like their new record can't say I was all that crazy about UFO fo assume forum James Blake that's good one i-i've own Iver father of the bride Vampire Weekend the new Thom Yorke record as well I would like to see it go to the James Blake although I wouldn't be surprised if it went to Bon Iver Vampire Weekend or Thom Yorke I feel like as far as I don't know industry cred they might carry a bit more as much as James Blake does have a passionate fan base I feel like the seals already kind of broke in there with us Bon Iver Best R&B Performance love again with Daniel Cesar and brandy which in my opinion is not a very good performance at all so I would be shocked to see it go there could have been her featuring Bryson tiller exactly how I feel Lizza with gucci mane roll Simo lucky day come home anderson pack featuring andre 3000 huh i would love to see it go - anderson though i know this would not be his first Grammy cheeky Anderson pack you but Liz oh exactly how I feel Gucci Mane I thought with that I thought with that heavy I would love to see Lizzy walk away with it I think that it could be likely that that her could get it but the Liz oh exactly how I feel that's exactly how I feel best traditional R&B performance time today bj the chicago kid steady love india arie Jerome Liz oh love that track Jerome Jerome lucky day real games bill for love PJ Morton Liz oh I wanted to be Liz oh and I think it will be Liz oh I think Liz oh is going to blow up but at the Grammys as well because she's been putting in a lot of work she has been a consistently bright shining entertaining face in the music industry this year and I think she's gonna be stealing the spotlight this year too Best R&B song could have been again her Bryson tiller look at me now Emily King no guidance with a Chris Brown featuring Drake which is not that great of a track role Simo again say so again I guess I guess could have been I would like to be could have been and I assume it will be could have been unless the industry is really gonna go Chris Brown this year but I think could have been could have been best urban contemporary album ooh the new Steve Lacey record Liz Oh Georgia and mold row which is it's nice Georgia Ann's got a not over here name you don't typically see in these lists now Jesse Rhea's again Liz oh I mean I'm going Bassam going full Liz Oh gimme the Liz Oh Best R&B album 1 1 2 3 bj the chicago kid lucky day painted eleme her self-titled paul morton's paul bandura Anderson PAC wouldn't would like to see it go to the ventura and i think it could probably go to the ventura if not the ella i think it's really a race between anderson and Ella on this one but I'm gonna say I want Anderson PAC I'm gonna call Anderson PAC Anderson PAC so now we have best rap performance middle child Jay Cole shook the baby down bad dream Ville featuring JIT bass Jay Cole earth gang and young nu D racks in the middle Nipsey Hussle with rowdy rich and hit boy clout offset featuring cardi B how is Jake hole in this category twice once with no features and once as a feature either way I would like to see it go to middle child I think that is the best track of the bunch honestly best rap song performance hired rip to hard panini ballin the London again another category that could have easily featured Tyler the Creator who made far superior music this year but no I guess not well we already know that I'm not gonna pick little baby and gonna so I'm just gonna have to go with panini hey panini as much as I do like this higher track with nipsey and John Legend from DJ Khaled easily the best track on his new album there could be a run for this track given the nipsey factor but personally it would crush my soul to see DJ khaled walk away with a grammy in this category at the very least to give it to young thug with Jay Cole and Travis Scott please young thug holding a Grammy would um be amazing best rap song bad idea with YB and chordae featuring chance the rapper that's it that's a good ybn track gold roses with Rick Ross featuring drake no boring a lot 21 savage featuring Jay : that is a good song might be my favorite song in this batch with racks in the middle and Suge also in here I like a lot that's my favorite although I think there's kind of a big shot here for a bad idea and gold roses even Suge with it being platinum frankly I think there's maybe a bigger shot for those tracks but I like a lot I'll pick a lot best rap album revenge of the dreamers three championships I am I was Igor finally The Lost Boy YB and Corday not a bad mix of records I think I enjoyed the Tyler the savage and YB and Cordia the most though for me personally it easily goes to Tyler and I hope it goes to Tyler I hope the industry doesn't pick some safe ass choice here and just goes dreamville because they're the most inoffensive it should be Tyler it's the best one here though I don't have strong feelings on the best country solo performance category I personally would like to see it go to Tyler Childers because I feel like he's the most authentic and interesting artist of the bunch and with the best Latin rock urban or alternative album it has to has to has to if there's anything right and just in the world it has to go to rosalia all these other artists here are fine but Rosalia is the best and came through with the most creative record and choose the best vocalist of the bunch here in my opinion - nobody is paralleling Rosalia right now give her this goddamn Grammy for the best American roots performance here frankly I would love to see it go with Yola not sure what the likelihood is that it will go to anyone else but I think Yola should get it I would say my feelings are similar on the best American roots song and best Americana album - but as far as the best reggae album category goes even though I'm pretty sure it's in the EP I would like to see it go to coffee because that rapture project has quite a few good songs on it and I feel like as far as contemporary reggae artists go she's bringing one of the most cutting-edge sounds that fits pretty seamlessly into the current music landscape while still authentically feeling very much like genuine reggae music with producer of the Year non-classical we have a pretty interesting mix of faces that have really helped craft the sound of the year with Jack Antonoff working with Kevin abstract taylor swift lana red hearse dan auerbach put in a lot of work this year also John Hill is on here - who has really killed it with John Mayer Kate's the elephant young the giant Carly Rae Phineas who of course is all over the Billy Eilish and Ricky read with fiddler Maggie Rogers Liz OH - and a lot more this is a tough choice I wouldn't be surprised to see it go to Phineas just based off of the hype of that Billy record personally I think I would like to see it go to Jack because while I do love what Phineas did on that record and I like Dan and I like the work of John and in Ricky - I think jack is really you know had a quality over quantity approach and what he's contributed to each one of these records which was a whole lot was great and I think I am going to leave it at that everyone that has been my take and predictions and hopes for the 2020 Grammy Awards make sure to let me know your thoughts down below in the comments and yeah over here next to my head is a nother video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Grammys the forever 
NMsEzAg_E7o,hi everyone Tran theny send tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new liturgy album Haq q this is the latest LP from the experimental metal project masterminded by hunter hunt hendrix composer guitarist singer songwriter arranger the title is obviously an acronym it stands for high Lagaan above quality and quantity that and the front cover here are a product of hunters incredible mind which always seems to be at work not just on new music but also on exposing these deep philosophical concepts that seem to inform the sounds he creates follow hunter hunt Hendrix's exploits online and soon you'll be catching views of charts and lists loaded with heavy terminology maybe even a paragraph or two from a manifesto or a really long-winded vlog talking about metaphysics I would call it pretentious if it didn't all seem like it was coming from a genuine place of curiosity and also vulnerability like hunter is genuinely trying to connect to something greater than himself and invite others to do the same and that something hunter is attempting to connect to often comes with a religious or a spiritual component which isn't surprising considering how much the project genuinely borrows from black metal music but liturgy isn't your average black metal band not just in terms of musical aesthetics take 2015's the ark work for example which was loaded with elements of glitch music hip hop MIDI all coming together with the bands typically loud and searing guitars and drums in a really intriguing way there's also a hunter refers to in his black metal writings as the burst be less of a steady and stiff blast style of drumming that has been the backbone of numerous classic black metal records and more of a fluid rolling percussion style that allows the band to quickly build up into these amazing overwhelming crescendos on numerous tracks you can hear it on most if not all of the tracks on liturgies Aesthetica quite a few of the songs here - and this percussion style just brings this amazing feeling of metallic transcendence that to my ears has been unpair throughout the decade so there's all that and then there's hunter hunt Hendrix's philosophical intentions behind the music that he composes which arguably is put liturgy and a lot more hot water than anything they're doing musically now in retrospect I get why black metal traditionalists would reject and be openly angry toward Hunter publicly trying to create this antithesis to the forms that make up classic black metal records like Transylvanian hunger not only that but Hunter openly encouraged American bands to break off from these roots entirely do their own thing mostly in the spirit of artistic evolution and I think listening closer to Hunter's music and reading his words makes it clear that he doesn't hate the Scandinavian black metal scene I mean how could he his life's work is so indebted to it sadly Hunter's vision for a mass embrace of a new direction for the genre didn't really pan out black metals purist mindset has prevented the genre on the whole from going much of anywhere since 2011 and the burgeoning American scene that was creating a gigantic buzz for a moment is quickly becoming a passing phase that lasted between two hunters and sunbae there seems a great deal of the crowd were just into the shoegaze the aesthetics of some of the more black gay Z bands out there I guess for is grumpy and as immovable as black metal traditionalists are you have to kind of respect the fact that they're still here plugging away as if none of this ever happened but so is hunter - as this new liturgy record is a bold culmination of everything that has made the project groundbreaking up until this point now despite Haq queue being so large in scope this album is actually one of liturgies trim astoya with just nine tracks 45 minutes the tracklist is pretty evenly divvied up into these seven or eight minute metal pieces and two or three-minute interludes in between them only major exceptions are the droning guitar outro and the tracks virginity and passacaglia which are not lengthier metal pieces but side-by-side they complement each other feeling like a larger 9 minute block so the kickoff to this record the intro track I think is as grand a statement you could ask for from the beginning of a liturgy album all of these light swirling electronic glitches instantly explode this furious wall of guitars and drums it is a fluid burst of energy the performance is already incredible the guitars are so quickly picked the drums are dizzying what follows from here are a series of versatile and somewhat mathematical guitar and drum passages that hunter tries to arrange other instrumentation around he already showed his ambitions to do this on the ark work in 2015 and now he is building on that desire here really perfecting honing but now he's doing it with these alternating layers of squealing woodwinds and woeful moans I know it's not this but it does really sound like a couple of people in the studio blowing as hard as they can into a couple of recorders meanwhile the singers at this point on the song sound like they're either too cold or depressed to be singing now I will admit all this sounds very odd but the placement of these sounds in the mix is actually pretty good a lot better than I thought the ear piercing bells were placed on the artwork it all sounds messy at first but eventually the woodwinds and the vocals in their own way sync up with some of the guitar leads layering up in a way that feels kind of triumphant just before a quick glitchy transition the stakes of this track are raised even higher when these singing genuinely starts to sound great angelic at this point of the song we're just bordering on listening to an Avant metal opera and there are a lot of different phases throughout this track all of them flowing together pretty seamlessly eventually concluding with a very strong ending - not sure if I could have asked this song to set the tone for this album any better it's like hunter perfectly distilled one of his dense philosophical or sonic theses into a musical composition the first X occur in Turla that comes after this isn't a bad moment on the record it's a quick regal piano piece with some glitchy edits here and there aesthetically doesn't sound like anything that came before it or comes after it but by the end of the record it's pretty clear these intermission moments are merely just palate cleansers to almost clear your mind in between these incredibly dense and relentless performances compositions mixes because this album is a very intense listen and as a liturgy fan of course I anticipated what I'm hearing on the intro track but really by the end of the record it really starts to weigh down on you so while these interludes don't make for the best album flow that I've ever heard in my entire life they do sound good and it's certainly a lot better than if the interludes were boring or if the interludes weren't even there at all the track virginity opens up with all these gorgeous harp runs literal harp runs cascading over tragic tremolo picked guitars that distant throaty retched screaming style of singing that Hunter usually brings to liturgies albums is here but now it's sounding a little freakish a little inhuman Hunter starts hitting listeners with even more synced up guitar leads and choral vocals but this time they're really going hand-in-hand climbing up this amazing melodic progression that just gets higher and higher and higher with the guitars and drums being played more fiercely the higher this melody reaches it sort of has the effect of seeing a pong ball bouncing back and forth between two paddles on a screen and eventually it starts going so fast it becomes a blur for me it's stuff like this that makes liturgy one of the most if not the most dynamic band and metal today because I can't really think of any groups that are doing such fast skilled well-executed and composed swells and crescendos like these your favorite post metal band could never this is pretty much the end of the track as I mentioned earlier from here we get a very smooth transition into the song passacaglia which immediately brings us into these head-banging heavy grand riffs that feel like an amazing let off of tension built up by virginity and the epic quality of the riffs on this track are enhanced by the woeful and dreary strings hanging in the background there's then some added layers of glockenspiel and vibraphone whose tiny ringing fluttery notes are reminiscent of some of the bells that were included on the ark work but I just find it to be a lot more gratify this time around the rest of the song is mostly a thunderous riff fest maybe not as tightly executed or is hypnotic as some of the groovier songs from Aesthetica mostly because the added instrumentation here makes it a bit of a behemoth but it's still a pretty incredible moment on the record the second interlude on the record is a chilling Bell piece whose notes seem to ring out for ever it's another nice palate cleanser and becomes a bit surreal when these ghostly vocal harmonies and pianos start drifting into the mix then we have God of love which I thought was great as a single as a teaser track to this album and it sounds even more powerful in the tracklist and kicks off with a seriously cinematic string opening much of what's to follow features the very same instrumental suspects that we've been hearing so far but now it's all culminating the vocals the vibes the glockenspiel the strings the bells the guitars and drums these things are intensifying hammering on the mix all at once it is mind-blowing ly thick and loud on at least a few points it sounds like the whole thing is just going to implode and the song is structurally impressive too despite how much is going on each section feels pretty defined from the last and the structure of the track is really impressive too great momentum carried across the song each musical passage contrasts really well from the next now considering how heavy and relentless and just mind melting this cut was the third interlude here I felt personally like I really truly needed the spacious fluttering pianos here are a very nice and welcome break and it's it's great that they last for almost four minutes because really after everything that has occurred before it god of love is just a marathon the title track is effectively the records last hurrah it's not as heavily arranged as most of the songs that precede it but that's fine what really gets the magic of the song across is the muscular and very toned riffing and drumming throughout the track hitting these great very sharp grooves ensure at various points of the song there are some vocals or piano hanging in the background but they don't take up that much of the mix they don't distract too much from what the drums and the guitars are doing the stop on a dime transitions the head-banging riffs and all of this is strangely enhanced by the multiple I would say really incessant at some points glitchy edits that are placed throughout the track all of a sudden a riff will be thrown into this cycling skip and then just burst into another drum beat or riff it's pretty impeccable how hunter is able to manipulate these skips and these glitches to actually build up and intensify any number of moments of the composition from here we have a seamless transition into the semi ambient outro on this record who's curious bells and pianos eventually give way to some very raw and tinny guitars the sound pretty typical for any number of liturgy compositions but eventually these guitars get very fat and distorted kind of shoegaze ii droney a little uneventful as a final final moment on the record but I think for an album of this general intensity a meditative finish can be pretty fitting I truly don't have many complaints about this record I wish it came out earlier in the loudest and thickest moments here there are spots that I wish where the sound engineering was better the separation between the instruments was better but the fact that it all comes together and such a grand aggressive explosive loud way is a pretty decent trade-off for sure some of the transitions into the interlude tracks could have been better while all that would be great it would just be a cherry on top of what's already an incredible album and with this record being out and with this decade coming to a close I would like to say that the general lack of appreciation for liturgy has tried to do in the metal field this decade is one of the biggest l's of this past 10 years this lack of appreciation will most likely continue on for a very long time because hunters music is certainly not going to appeal to everyone but hopefully we can reach a point where the ideas presented here aren't so unorthodox and more innovation in black can be widely accepted beyond someone trying to take the genres already smudgy sound and just apply some shoegazing aesthetics to it which is fine but there's so much untapped potential in the genre that only a few groups seem to be willing to dig out and liturgy is certainly one of them in my opinion the most successful most daring as well especially on this record I'm feeling a light to decent nine on this one transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or

9aInNmFYxRM,hi everyone smoked the knee water tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Mount Erie album lost wisdom part 2 this is the latest full-length album from Phil el vrom zone Mount Erie just in case you are unaware Phil elrom in my opinion is one of the greatest minds to come out of lo-fi indie and singer-songwriter music and now he's dropping a collaborative record with fellow singer and songwriter formerly of the band Eric's trip Julie Doran and this is the second time they are crossing over on to an entire full-length album which should be pretty obvious given that this thing is titled lost wisdom part to the original lost wisdom actually came out over ten years at this point sidenote songwriter Fred Squire was also included in those original lost wisdom sessions he doesn't seem to have carried over on to the sequel record here which is a change that's worth noting also one that I'm not too excited to see mostly because that first lost wisdom record is so important to me it's such a cute rustic heartening intimate little album that's attached to some of the best song writing under the Mount Erie name and even though I welcome the idea of a sequel I wonder if the very specific brand of magic to that original record is gonna carry over can that be rekindled in such different times under such different circumstances and maybe I'm overthinking it maybe Phil and Julie the two primary voices of lost wisdom all they need to do to justify coming out with another record in this series is just to collaborate on a full-length together once again but there's not really anything about that original lost wisdom record for as much as I've loved it over the years that's communicated to me that a sequel was on the way or that one was even necessary so because Phil is consciously referencing back to that lost wisdom album I have to assume that there are characteristics and similarities between these records that go beyond their personnel this must be some kind of spiritual or thematic successor and if that is the case I'm not really hearing it despite lost wisdom to only being a handful of minutes longer than the original the songs on this one aren't nearly as catchy or straightforward even on the shortest track here pink light which is easily one of the sketchiest and most impressionist ik songs of the bunch to the point where it feels almost unnecessary and even when Phil and Julie do manage to drum up a good track in the tracklist here it feels less like a folk tune and more like a long-winded musical meditation or diary reading in that respect lost wisdom to shares more in common with mount Airy's dawn or Phil's last major album now only except not nearly as consistent while I personally think it's unfair to expect Phil to be writing from the same place that he was in in 2008 especially after everything he's been through over the past several years I also would have never expected him to brand a new album after something he had done in 2008 either because these two records just show such different qualities in terms of songwriting and ethos on the original lost wisdom the title track was a song that was essentially trying to juxtapose loneliness raw emotional pain against all of this sad uncaring nature imagery like the world and everything natural in it is just moving on while I'm by my lonely in respect to the nature imagery it is a Mount Erie album so you know there's gonna be like a rock or a tree or two and curiously enough there's already been a lost wisdom too in the Mount Erie discography a track of exactly that title on the back end of Phil El rooms wins poem a fantastic foray into black metal that he came out with not too long after lost wisdom and of course sequel tracks and stuff like that are nothing new for Phil but just thought it was worth noting especially since despite the aesthetic change on that wins poem album that track feels like more of a true lyrical and melodic successor to the original lost wisdom album and track the closest thing we get to that over here is the track real lost wisdom which I think there's potential in doing a track like this exploring some of the lyrical themes and ideas of the original losing wisdom losing something significant as a result of losing a connection with a loved one or someone important to you Phil then relays that to his connection with his young daughter the songs biggest takeaways are essentially love in ten sleep while you can love is worth it love is worth existing for fill also equates love to gazing into a flame or a fire that you just don't avert your eyes from it's a pretty powerful message but still forgettable tune not one of these stronger songs and the tracklist here sadly which is again something I miss so much about that first lost wisdom album how tuneful it was the same messages about love are echoed on to these songs that bookend this album belief and believe part to the latter is a lot better than the former just by virtue of being sweeter less long-winded it's a gentle piano ballad performed in a very slow motion with Phil and Julie's vocals intertwining nicely a genuinely beautiful moment trying to express an undying devotion to love this message of not losing faith in love less enchanting on this album are the songs that engage in not as lofty topics offering instead plain and frank descriptions of what seemed like normal goings-on with maybe a few poetic embellishments here and there like on the track when I walk out of the museum or on the track and during the waves which Phil kicks off lyrically with the image of him sitting on a train reading about Buddhism and listening disaster as a longtime fan of Phil's work you might assume that these graphic descriptions of his everyday existence would be exciting intriguing or revealing but for the most part they just feel humdrum and uneventful I mean it's typical as the idea of love or the loss of love is it's it's actually really where the best moments of this album turn up the song love without possession is certainly a highlight here with its quaint and simple guitar strumming with Phil and Julia's voices harmonizing in this very awkward but endearing way it's a pretty linear progression the instrumentation beefs up a little bit toward the end and we start getting what sounds like a Velvet Underground style jam then the song widows is a very unlikely single-parent widower anthem and I'm not trying to use that term in a funny or ironic way because it's literally the only track here with roaring distorted chords and soaring lo-fi guitar leads as Phil sings about dealing with the PTSD of losing his wife and just being haunted by memories of his past look overall I think this album is okay it's not a bad Mount Erie record but I feel like lost wisdom too as a sequel in name and in name only because sonically and lyrically this project has way more in common with Phil's most recent works than it does anything he dropped ten years ago even with Julie Doran in the mix for the entire record and of course Phil and Julie collabing again is not a bad thing they work together really well but this is far from the best material they've recorded together and that has only made more obvious with it being a sequel I'm feeling a light too decent six on this one

VuWOK6_7GZU,hi everyone my and grain tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new little peep compilation everybody's everything this is a new compilation of songs from little peep which has pretty much been released in tandem with a documentary film about the late rapper and singer's life and rise through the music industry I went into this new and old mix of tracks pretty skeptically because in most cases I think the music industry releasing music posthumously from a popular artists especially when those tracks are just odds and ends that can be pretty exploitative for me it needs to be clear that those releasing the music took the utmost care in maintaining the image and legacy and the aesthetic of the artists that they that they're dropping music from the released material should be flattering not sub par or embarrassing and even though there are some tracks on this comp that I would say are subpar and mediocre I still read the whole compilation and documentary rollout as being pretty genuine as well as tasteful at least this collection of tracks is being released as a compilation which fans again know is posthumous so they can expect at least some of the material here to be rough around the edges this whole thing could very well be a mixed bag the fact that it's been paired with the documentary just enhances this feeling that the release of this material feels like it's just meant to expose some of the uncovered corners of peeps musical mind so we have an hour of material here spread out amongst 19 tracks and the quality and the sound of these songs kind of varies some tracks on this compilation are well produced and feature complete structures as well as robust hooks and verses from peep like with the track moving on it's simple and steady and effective track beat pairs very well with the Sat acoustic guitar passages this song also features one of peeps most impassioned vocal performances ever it's hard-hitting it's tragic and a very welcome change of pace from the more comatose vocal performances on peeps previous stuff it seems an equal amount of care went into tracks like Belgium and when I lie tracks that essentially make up the also posthumously released goth angel sinner EP live forever ghost boy and keep my kumuk for a trio of highlights as well the first to see people in a bit of very dreary cloud wrap with tons of reverb making these tracks feel very pillowy very dreamy taking a bit of the edge off of the incredibly depressing blend of Punk and trap and emo that peep was known for and keep my KUSI's peep on what sounds like kind of an old-school classic Memphis sound his eccentric delivery and flow the weird somewhat lo-fi synths on this track also the ghostly groans occurring in the background the atmosphere as well it's a spooky flex easily one of my favourite tracks here and a direction I would have been excited to hear peep go into if you were still around and as long as we're talking weird surprises and highlights on this compilation we have I've been waiting with Isle of Makonnen which maybe some of you are saying yeah I've heard that track the Fall Out Boy track I've heard that single no this is the non Fall Out Boy original version of the song which sounds vastly different for one the beat is a lot cuter it is not nearly as glossed up or over produced which is quite nice and the vocal qualities of the song are a lot different too with peeps and McKown ins vocals overlapping quite a bit it's almost as if they are doing a bit of a duet here now don't get me wrong the singing on this track is not the best in fact I would say at some points it's kind of bad but what's happening on this track is so unlikely a sound and a style for peep and Makonnen I guess it's fun to hear them just so out of their element especially it seems like vocally they're in a competition to see who can ham the song up the most so even as someone who historically has not really been a peep fan at all they're definitely highlights on this record that I respect and also enjoy but then again there are tracks on this compilation that are really rough around the edges not super well-executed or peep even sounds scarce on his own song mostly with the track ratchets featuring little Tracy where people only contribution to this track is really just the the refrain the hook the bulk of the song is really handled by Tracy and unless you're a Tracy fan I guess it's fine if you enjoy what peeps cohorts and the goth boy clique offer but I don't know to my ears it's very clear that the talent gap between peep and any member of the clique is about as wide as the English Channel though still I respect the decision to have people on here like Tracy because it's it's certainly more tasteful than just grabbing a bunch of random ass rappers that peep didn't work with that peep didn't have any connection to still having said that nearly every Gabe feature on this comp is a shade of terrible his voice is unbearably nasal and whiny he sounds like the former singer of a long-forgotten emo pop band out of the 2000s he really weighs some of these tracks down despite the hooks to LA to London or rock stars being so good and all the little Tracy features on the back end of the compilation I'm not that crazy about either especially on white tee which generally to my ears just seems like a waste of a postal service sample so despite my compliments and admiration for how this compilation and documentary we're so tastefully rolled out there are tracks on here that are obviously flawed not all that complete it's also dogged a little bit by the general subpar singing and lyricism that I've never been too crazy about in peeps previous stuff though I will say the fetishization of depression and addiction seems to have been toned down a little bit on at least some of this material and I like that a lot overall this thing's not a terrible compilation I liked quite a few tracks on it even some of my favorite peeps augs land on this collection of tracks which is a phrase that I never thought I would hear myself say but there are quite a few duds in the track list too I'm feeling a strong 5 on this compilation indifferent toward it on a whole I'm not super crazy about it I don't think it's bad either however I still would recommend listening to it even if you are casually a fan of little peeper things that sound like little peep if not only for the highlights that are on this thing transition have you given this compilation to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as

90KKkgAUaNM,hello hello hello everyone and he Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week they're all linked down below so you can check them out you can hear them for yourself before I get into it I have to shut out our turntable lab link down there in the description box you can get a colorful pressing of a record we have reviewed on the main channel we get kicked back from it you get vinyl our channel gets some support in exchange for that and also our patreon page is down below as well where you can if you hit up that for a small monthly fee $2.00 for our monthly bonus patron only let's argue we just dropped a new one and for that not only do

there some listening parties of classic albums that we do on a monthly basis as well also our let's argue shout out sort of name list at the end of each episode tier as well hit up that page link down below thank you very much for supporting the channel supporting the content and everything that we do alright and the worst tracks of the week we have a handful just a couple and then we will move on to greener pastures one the new of Montreal track peace to all freaks I don't know what has pushed Kevin Barnes into this sudden we have to do an 80's song we have to do a synth pop song direction but it it does not sound good the production is weak the aesthetic he's trying to grasp on to hear rekindle essentially recapture on his own recording is displayed pretty weakly and the song isn't even that great so um can't say based off of this I'm all that excited for this new of Montreal record but whatever moving on from there modest mouse has a new one now ice cream party and it does not sound like a party at all it is the slowest most boring single Modest Mouse has ever put out period and I thought some of the tracks from the band's last record were rough virtually none of the distinct and just basically thrilling or interesting characteristics of Modest Mouse's music that has defined their most classic records show up on this track even Isaac's voice just sounds completely off there's nothing about this song I find appealing and it's just really uneventful it's just really slow it's very hazy not a whole lot of substance just a lot of hot air in my opinion moving out from there also glass animals they have a new track out the features Denzel curry Tokyo drifting given the Denzel Curry feature I was pretty excited to give this thing a try but it is just a really weak attempt at trying to fuse like some pop rock and some trap and can't say I cared for much of any of it outside of denzel's verse denzel's verse was great I can't really say that the the song was boring or just felt like like a cheap imitation of something else on account of Denzel if there was no Denzel curry feature on this track there really would have been no reason to try it whatsoever I'm just hoping that glass animals while I've never been a huge fan I'm hoping that the entire record doesn't go down this direction because that would be that would that would be a difficult to listen to let's move on to the tracks that I thought were kind of met not blowing me away but still worth mentioning and pointing out still worth um some attention a mention first off the new track from Princess Nokia Balenciaga I like the sentiment and the theme of this track essentially about fashion thrifting kind of defining your own looking style which has always been princess Nokia's thing beat goes hard I like the flow lyrically it's not one of her best there are some lyrics that are kind of worthy of an eye roller here some very basic ass Rhymes here and there but for the most part I think this track is basically a thrift shop by Macklemore was was actually cool you know and was not total shit so um you know while that song is a fun and was certainly fun at the time that it dropped has not aged well I'm liking this track a bit more in terms of shelf life I guess so uh still shout out to the the attempt here you know there are a lot of good elements of this track and and maybe if you don't mind the lyrics you'll like it a lot more than me also shout-out to Loma Prieta continuum name of their new single I like the explosive and abrasive second leg of this track but I don't know why the entire first half is spent just like mimicking this slightly crunchy lo-fi very boring average indie rock sound where the vocals are buried to the point where you really don't get much out of them I like Loma Prieta as more chaotic approach to scream Oh some might even call it emo violence and that's cool I dig that about their stuff can't say I enjoy hearing them too much going down this boring indie rock road though again it they kind of pick it up in the second half and and go into more interesting a territory with that John Legend Kelly Clarkson John Legend's legendary Christmas his new Christmas album is out and he has a track on it with Kelly Clarkson that's pretty much more progressive updated less problematic version of baby it's cold outside I did a full-length review of this over on the Fantana channel it's a little corny yes but the original song is corny as hell too so I mean you know that that's that much hasn't changed are the lyrics less problematic yes you know I say just look at it as one of many many updates that have been done to Christmas or holiday songs over the decades that popular holiday song has commercially been a thing it's not like every single commercial holiday song that we hear on the radio or hear covers of year in and year out have has seen no alterations whatsoever at least the alterations on this one were I guess well-intentioned so it's okay some of the vocal performances could have been better on here - John and Kelly a few parts I think could have used another tape but overall not bad next janae I co brand new song featuring her ex Big Sean the title is none of your concern I am liking a lot of aspects of this track I think her vocals on here are more stunning than they've been in a little while instrumentally you think it's cool like the tune as well it's really just Big Sean on the back end that ends up kind of dragging the whole thing down because lyrically I don't think his verse fits the tone of the entire song I mean sure their elements their of desire and missing someone yeah okay but the incredibly perverse avenues that his lyrics go down just don't really seem all that fitting against what Aiko is doing for the majority of the track in my opinion just kind of seems like a square peg in a round hole but what are you gonna do we also have Harry Styles watermelon sugar I don't I don't really don't know what to say about this track I mean I like the instrumental it feels kind of classic as far as like a fusion of pop and maybe a little bit of rock music as well it's it's very light on the ears it's got a good groove to it I like that Harry is trying to do something that I had that I would say is is a little more mature but there's something in terms of just his delivery his performance his charisma frankly that's lacking I feel like he's really marketing himself in this rock star mode he is dressing very colorfully he's really like throwing himself into the spotlight and I think trying to be a little more eccentric and a little bit bolder in terms of his look and in terms of his singing style but um you know he's no Freddie Mercury man you know and that's that's really kind of all there is to it and not that you pulling directly from a queen thing but when you're talking about like you know the gods of gods when it comes to like front men and singers and just like dudes who hit the stage they hit the mic they have that pizzazz they have that certain something they have that incredible performance ability that incredible talent when it comes to execution and I just don't really feel like Harry has that you know unless the song is really amazing which I think the song is okay there's not a whole lot to get excited about because Harry is just not like burning the house down you know what I mean so I feel like this is kind of track that would warrant that sort of performance style but he just doesn't really bring it to the table I don't know all right moving on from there Grimes brand-new song from her upcoming record which is dropping in 2020 so heavy I fell through the earth art mix I think this track is pretty groovy which is cool but for the most part it just feels like a really dated piece of club' electronic music that's a little Moody maybe slightly dystopian but very washed out not much of a tune or a structure to it it's just really repetitive and I don't know it just seems like a bit of navel-gazing song wise song wise it just seems out to lunch you know it's got a groove it goes on for quite a while it's a very wash out it's got a lot of layers to it but not a whole lot of substance beyond what you're kind of hearing on the surface in terms of like the very pillowy and groovy bells and whistles I guess we have a brand-new track from a boogie with a hoodie reply featuring a little Aussie vert an artist whose stuff I don't typically cover on the channel but still I thought the song was worth covering because loozy verts verse on here is absolutely great vocally he I think goes harder than he has in a while and I like that he really just tries to a sell it on this track so a big respect to little Uzi vert for a really kind of pulling it off and pulling it off well on this new cut we have Billy Eilish brand new cut which I talked about over on the Fantana channel everything I wanted and it's it's okay it's kind of a fusion of art pop and house music I think the tune is OK I like the surreal nightmarish dreamy elements and the storytelling of the song but production is bland as hell production is so bland and as far as a fusion of pop music and house goes this is pretty typical not really a whole lot about it that I find to be special nothing nearly as unique or as creative as anything on Billy's latest record so I'm hoping for something better the pipe and baths wistful fata morgana brand-new single I don't know if you guys have listened to baths in a while I know it's been a while since I've covered baths on the channel though you know it's it's not like there's been a whole lot of baths music to talk about as of late but kind of shocked as to how much this song just sounds like a postal service song I I really don't know what the cause for this shift in sound and direction is on this track but it just pretty much sounds like a postal service song yeah I don't know it's okay it's not terrible but there didn't really seem too much influence wise being plugged into this track other than the Postal Service and I'm just not sure why best tracks of the week the tracks that really grabbed my attention we got a handful let's go through them one trippy red with the track over here death featuring - baby not really a whole lot to say about this track other than banger alert banger alert banger alert it's dark it's grimy it's nasty trippy solos are pretty good the baby is great on the track as well the baby continues to show his incredible talent as a feature artist he really just kind of picks any track that he's placed on up and not sure what else to say outside of that you know what makes this track entertaining it's pretty cut and dry alright moving on from there play that boy is a poison clan featuring Denzel curry and Anonymous's an artist who I've been turned on to because of his connections to Denzel curry these three come together on this track for an incredibly dark and aggressive I would say evil and sinister ass banger make sure to try it because it goes hard as hell and you can already tell from the cover over here it's a kind of evil as fuck alright a shout out to Neon Indian yeah an Indian is back dropping a brand new single Toyota man and yeah if you like that nostalgic brand of synth funk that Neon Indian typically brings to the table you'll like the bass line of this track but the track is in Spanish there are also what I would say elements of like I don't know what Tejano music I really don't know but there it's it's it's not just some straight gentrified western brand of synthy pop music I'll say that I love that he is bringing in some I guess more international flavors into into the mix I like that Alan is uh I guess you know even representing and I guess defending the groups of people who are being attacked you know I would say uh in an unwarranted fashion by the current administration's immigration policies because that is brought up in the music video as well though you know if you're just listening to the song and vibing to it it's not anything that's gonna you know sort of be in your face outside of the fact that hey it's it's pretty cool that uh you know we're hearing something that is a little outside of the the the you know American borders in terms of just you know the style the sound and everything so the song is catchy is hell loving the mix of influences production is great too good vocal performance from Alan as well and the creative and fun colorful music video which has of course you know some social commentary into it is just a cherry on top of this already nice ass musical sundae alright we have also ooh moses omni veer isle is the name of this new track and now some knee is getting bolder and bolder and bolder and more and more out there loving this this is a nice piece of art pop over here with some insane lead vocals on it and it is a lengthy track to it really is gonna make you hunker down for a while and just observe its majesty is is really all he can say about it majesty is what this track is filled with it's majestic so give it a try give it a shot very excited for moses some knees next couple of years if he's going to continue dropping material like this we also have ooh lim kim yellow brand-new EP which this is this is the EP over a year that she's recently dropped and this song over here yellow is an incredibly dark and amazing Bangor and I love that she is sort of influencing elements of her of her heritage into the music as well and kind of just kind of changing up that usual trap formula and it's it's really out there too it's really creative and it's incredibly again I'll say dark it's edgy it's a very left-field and you know if you like your your hip-hop weird and give this thing a shot because it's a goes goes pretty fricking hard and ooh we have miss Lauryn Hill here guarding the gates from the Queen and slim the soundtrack the soundtrack to Queen and slim and yeah this is a lengthy one too is a very long ballad about love with some rich background instrumentation it's a little repetitive but the performance is good and Lauryn Hill's voice sounds pretty good you know she's dropped some you know some material here and there over the course of this decade where maybe the instrumental or the vocals were pretty damn rough but that is not the case on this new track over here you know doesn't sound like the good old days or anything like that I'll say that but it's actually sounding really good don't know if her work on the soundtrack is going to spark you know a new commercial album or anything like that you know new solo release but hey you take what you can get and finally I think this is the last one we're gonna discuss here this brand new track a collaborative or you know really a crossover rather because a rest in peace Sparklehorse but a crossover between Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse ninja rest's featuring MF DOOM so incredible production on this one I'll say that much and MF DOOM his verse is good but it's it's typical and MF DOOM flows and similes and rhymes you know if you've heard him in his best moments throughout his discography you've heard verses as good if not better than what he's done here but still the fact that he's crossing over with these two and the fact the instrumental is so good on this one is caused to listen or regardless and obviously put in the best section because I love so that is going to be it I think that has been the weekly track roundup everyone hopefully hopefully hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this video you are the best I will see you in the next one Anthony Fantana music forever 
XQJ2o3Si9mU,hi everyone burst and he piped an O here the Internet's piss hissed music nerd and it's time for a review of the new dojo cat record hot pink this is the newest full-length LP from the singer rapper songwriter dojo cat a project I've been looking forward to ever since she went viral showing the more eccentric side of her personality with the unplanned breakthrough mu also undeniable bangers such as tia and tamera with rego nasty stuff that's certainly more fun and colorful than the forgettable pop rap and bland alternative R&B from her last record Amala now even though TN Tamara's nowhere near the tracklist of this record which makes me sad there was at least some material teasing torta that had me excited especially bottom bitch which is pretty much a summer jam that dropped just at the start of October and saw doja dipping our toes into the wave of emo trap and killing it the slow sad guitars on this instrumental which I believe are a blink-182 sample the steady trap beat the euphoric burst of on the hook all of this comes together for a simple but winning formula also the refrains and the weird relationship this song is in reference to with dojo cat referring to this woman she's singing about as being her bottom bitch and relating this relationship they have to that of a pimp and and how dynamic still an irresistible single to my ears though but what's disappointing after hearing the rest of hot pink it mostly seems like an isolated flash in the pan and that's pretty much what the entirety of hot pink is every single song hoping it's a breakthrough single dojaquez essentially jumping from one pre-established trendy idea to the next in hopes that she'll be able to fish out another hit which isn't inherently a bad thing we all want to hit song of course but the way in which that pursuit is gone about here results in an album that has no real focus or distinct personality the more I listen to it the less I feel like I have an actual grasp of who doja cat is as an artist what is her sound what is her style what is her anything now obviously a huge amount of thought went into just that on the visual side of things on the music video side of things on the marketing side of things when it comes to the actual music that you're marketing it's it's almost like an afterthought because again nearly every track here feels like it's essentially presenting me with a more agreeable lowest-common-denominator version of a sound or a style I've heard done better somewhere else by someone else like the song streets which is a washed-out utterly boring piece of dated alternative R&B sounds like where the genre was back in 2012 or 2013 it's like something Noah 40 would have produced for Drake years ago something the weekend would have sung on years ago but nowhere near as interesting the song say so is completely anonymous I would have never guessed this was a doja cat song had I not been told it sounds like a weird fusion of like I don't know a Gwen Stefani solo track and The Cardigans Love Fool just a very disco tinged pop that has a good vibe has a decent groove but the hooks the verses they're just okay the song addiction in my opinion is equally faceless I do like the aesthetic of the track it sounds like some old-school synth funk that's neon-lit said in Miami on a very steamy night in a club it's not a total exercise in nostalgia though it has some sleek punchy updates to the bass to the beats but that's about it and while it's not a terrible track why does the song won't bite sound like basically a bubblegum version to the intro of Childish Gambino's this is America you know what I mean that passage with the vocal harmony is in the very plucky fun bright acoustic guitars yes imagine that passage but ripped off watered down extended out into an entire song and rapped over and that's pretty much what you have here also the more I listen to cyber sex the more reminds me of Pink Friday air and Nicki Minaj but with a lower budget dreamier singing and slightly less pop appeal shout out to the lyrics about sexuality in the internet era though that's pretty apt and some of doshas zany rap flows in the second half of the track I do love because they mark one of the few actually eccentric and odd moments on the record an album that generally plays it pretty safe you ain't getting pussy you fuckin an AI doja has a few focused and worthwhile topics on this record a handful of one-liners that may be worth repeating but there are also plenty of spots on this thing where she's falling very short on the lyrical front especially on like talk dirty in an age where female rappers are speaking so unapologetically about their sexuality in song I imagine it can be kind of hard to stand out that's certainly what this track struggles with I mean compared lyrically to a cupcake a Brooke candy or even a cardi B sometimes the material here is pretty vanilla also the vocal distortion on doges voice which is not anywhere else on the record just here is obnoxious as is the flow and while there are better tracks here they're still very little too freaked out about the spastic and freaky auto-tune vocals on the track shine certainly grab my ear I like the overall vibe and aesthetic of the song but the lyrics are pretty much just very generic glitzy flexing nothing really all that interesting the very flirty like that has one of the best hooks on the entire project some of doshas most seductive and alluring lyrics but the Gucci Mane feature is painfully average and just really sad he phoned it in juicy with Tyga should get a mention as well given how huge the song has been for both of them I think that the beat is awesome I like doges flows and her chorus on the track especially that line about if you see it from the front wait till you see it from the back there are a lot of good things about this song there are a lot of good things about it but what is not so good about it is just how uninteresting and boring the freaking verses are Tyga does on this track what I think dozens of other rappers could have done better and doja on the back end of the song feels like she's an afterthought on her own track it's just not one of her better vocal or lyrical performances sadly on a track related to one of the most beautiful things on this planet the booty I expect more so again there's just not a whole lot to enjoy on this record or be excited about you know there's there's a lot of material here that to me feels very agreeable very background very generic certainly not offensive or the worst thing that I've ever heard in an isolated context but as an entire album it's just really disappointing to hear an entire record that really has little in the way of personality direction character distinct or original ideas hot pink is just aggravatingly average aggravating because doja cat given her personality given her talent vocally that she showcased so far she is capable of so much more I'm feeling it decent too strong for on this one Tran position have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next if the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my head is another video that you

1J3s6wbc-S4,ah hi everyone Bluth anis Caetano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Montana Roberts project coin coin chapter for Memphis this is the latest LP from Chicago saxophonist composer spoken word artist Montana Roberts who has spent much of this decade ambitiously crafting an album series that she is now on the fourth installment of coin coin the whole thing functions like the musical equivalent to a multi chapter book exploring themes of one's past and how we remember it so far it's been a pretty versatile series with these shocking shrieks and free jazz passages of coin coin chapter one in 2011 in 2015 Roberts took the project into a surprisingly droney and experimental direction with Chapter three and even though I haven't loved every moment of coin coins so far you really never know what you're gonna get given the themes of coin coins so far especially on this new album one could make the assumption that Roberts interpretation of memory or recollecting one's history especially traumatic history can be a pretty unpredictable or even disorienting experience and as much as I do love coin coin chapter 1 because that record did truly leave a pretty big impact on me with how bold some passages of it were the more I listened to it chapter 4 might be my new favorite installment maybe the most gratifying chapter in the series so far this record feels like I'm being aggressively pushed through this noisy overwhelming series of scattered thoughts interpreted through many things spoken word pieces spirituals free jazz seems like the point is to make it hard for the listener to make heads or tails of anything at least on the first leg of the record that disorienting feeling it kind of dissipates toward the end of the album as we get clearer views of the memories that Montana is pointing toward it's like Roberts main protagonists on the record a young girl is blocking these horrific memories out of her mind but is slowly getting a firmer grasp of them toward the end of the whole thing now the sound and the production on this record are very raw up front every instrument is clear as hell a lot of punch very dynamic pretty much consistent with the sound quality that constellation records in hotel to tango have built their name on over the years even in the most cacophonous and abrasive and overwhelming free jazz passages on this record there's still quite a bit of space between all the instrumentation it's all very readable and intelligible each horn blur and woodwind flutter and drum hit you can really dive into the details of all of these pieces despite how noisy they are the production the engineering does result in some pretty great sound pallets on this one not gonna lie the stumbling drunken screaming jazz horns on fit to be tied are incredible they sound like a violent alcoholic stepping out of a bar at 4:00 a.m. some of these psychedelic swirls of vibraphone on the track shoes of gold are certainly pretty also the eye widening and chilling vocal harmonies on the track her mighty waters run which is a very dark portrayal of a spiritual type song another moment on the record that's genuinely frightening there's also the 10-minute trail the smiling Sphinx which works in multiple passages one of the boldest and most telling phases is when we get what sounds like the scratchy buh double bass notes I'm not sure what it would be if not that and they are performed in such a way where they sound almost like a group of fat hogs just going insane on a bucket of slop which is pretty odd but it adds to the disturbing sound set on top of it of these reed and fiddle notes just screaming and going insane playing these very familiar in Old Country melodies which in a bunch of different contexts would seem friendly nice or kind of upbeat fun even but on this record instead very dark almost scary in a way I think it's a testament to how your brain can interpret really just about anything in a negative light when it's associated with a traumatic experience coincoin Memphis kicks off with a bit of an intro with jewels of the sky inscription which is a pretty dramatic drone that builds up into a massive mountain of bass horns Roberts then tensely rattles off what seems like an internal monologue from our main character here talking about running and running talking about her father more memories of her father being a child of the wind a lot of lyrical repetition in this spoken word piece which I think comes down to Robert's in the head of her character trying to recall these moments that she's referencing like she can't quite move beyond the handful of things she's saying and connect it to anything else yet so she's just kind of thinking of them over and over and over folding them over in her mind to see if turning it over once more sort of raises up a new memory a new fact a new something which at first is very odd not really knowing or understanding where the album is going but once you hear through the entire thing listening to it over once more and kind of understanding where the whole thing is headed it becomes um quite ingenious after this we get some plucky acoustic notes some jaw harp as well to really kind of bring that southern flavor I feel like I am just in the deep south in the dead of summer under the beating Sun I'm just sweating my brains out now this calm gives way to the instrumental storm on trail the smiling Sphinx that I mentioned earlier we move through somebody crushingly loud and disturbing moments on this track it's it's really hard to keep up the whole thing is just flattening my mind to the point where all the molecules spread out into the next galaxy spoken word on this track returns more recollections of our protagonists father the family of the protagonist being given a hard time I think going to a white church or wanting to worship at a white church last fragment of this progression is this image of candy colored skin being lit up by a bright hot light and its parts like this especially going back and listening to the entire record that give me a sinking feeling I feel like I'm watching something happen in front of me that I am desperate to stop but I'm powerless I'm moving in slow motion I'm not really there on that plane of reality the very negative vibes coming off of this track are enhanced by harrowing horns which all contrasts very well with the spacious and dreamy shoes of gold which references back to a story being told in a bit of spoken word earlier on the album and while I like the sound the aesthetic the instrumental makeup the track compositionally the song is mostly just very incoherent vibraphone some guitar some basses well I wish that there was a bit more chemistry in between all the musicians on this track for the most part they seem almost disconnected in a way really the whole thing just sounds like I don't know an experimental music piece coming from a 1950 sound stage owned by a major media studio the next track wildfire bear isn't bad either but I'm more excited by the middle of the track than I am by anything surrounding it after that we get fit to be tied that I mentioned earlier that just demented barroom jazz sound of the horns on this track is just a oh it's anxiety inducing it is disturbing and so pivotal to the narrative in the progression of this album core mighty waters run comes after this that I mentioned earlier incredible spiritual peace great vocal break for the record - now with all things beautiful which in my opinion is another incredible track here we get more bits of the narrative the smell of embers people wearing hoods being frightened being told to run again the story coming together becoming clearer on the following in the fold the narrative continues there's lots of droning tones on this track more jaw harp Roberts singing the melody of this little light of mine against this slightly unsettling backdrop she depicts our protagonist here as being lost having run away from this attack on her family she is going to a new home as she says in the midst of where she is she finds a plate of food I guess in the middle of the wilderness and everyday she finds a new plate but it's set further away from where I guess she's hiding out she suspects this is a trap but she continues on eating it anyway then we get some memories or updates on her parents post this event her father moving on her mother in an asylum essentially never seeing her again after this we have a very quick transition into raise yourself up which vocally features what I can only call like battle cries pounding drums it's a really aggressive build-up it reminds me of so many amazing moments from some incredible god speed records over the years honestly but with a more jazzy I guess sound palette the closing track is a pretty interesting mix of sound some pump organ bold Sachs Industrial distortion just roaring away in the background like white noise some rumbling bass - it meets a somewhat abrupt end but it's still very bold finished for a very bold album that feels less like just sitting back and listening to some music and more like literally being transported into someone's shoes as they're having some of the most negative experiences of their entire life even though there were a few tracks that I thought could have been a bit better I'm still walking away from this thing thinking wow I'm also left wondering what's next what is after this for Roberts and for a coin coin in general because certainly not every bit of the narrative and in every memory presented here is sort of tied up and explained I'm still leaving this album with a lot of questions and conceptually that's not necessarily the worst thing in the world considering how dodgy and unpredictable the records presentation of memory is overall loving the concept behind this record how well it is executed loving the performances here the production is incredible loving the writing and compositions loving how compelling the spoken word passages on this thing are this record is a feat and Robert should be very proud of what she's achieved here because this thing has very quickly become one of my favorite jazz and experimental records of the decade sure I wish it went on longer and I wish it told me more but I guess that's just more reason to look out for the fifth installment of this series and when it ever ends it'll be interesting to go back and listen to all of them over again and see if the greater context of all these records just kind of adds to the experience I'm feeling a decent too strong nine on this one transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it

4pRxNcHyxKQ,haha hi everyone slave mini tre tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of my new self-titled record from singer/songwriter Michael Kiwanuka who frankly has been killing it for quite a few years now going gold in the UK with his last record and his debut record he actually does pretty decent numbers throughout Europe it's just over here in the US that he hasn't totally exploded yet despite him being one of the few current day mainstream parallel songwriters that truly embodies the classic sounds of American soul music now Michael is not simply that he is a singer-songwriter at heart also works into his music elements of psychedelic rock folk music making his catalogue so far a pretty versatile array of classic sounds from the American Songbook up to this point while I have loved a track here and there from Michael's last record his debut record I'm really yet to fall in love with a whole project their moments on Michaels records where I feel like his vocals just come off a bit too mild moments where the songs aren't as memorable or where the instrumentation production is a bit too sterile or overwrought I love what Michaels sound and style represents even the messaging behind some of his songs like the very lovesick and funny bones or the unflinching black man in a white world so up to this point I've been admiring Michael's work from afar but also feeling like something distinct or necessary is missing his latest record here self-titled third record I'm taking notice mostly because the teaser tracks from this album were so excellent easily some of Michaels best work so far you ain't the problem piano joint the show-stopping hero which sounds like a mid-60s protest song that would have rocked the Woodstock stage back in the day and while Michael has worked with Danger Mouse before on his last flank record he seems to now be the primary voice and brain behind the production here which i think has led to a sound that is far more representative of an era that Mykel so obviously borrows his ideas from but they achieved this without making this records appeal feel as if it is rooted in this nostalgia gimmick but seriously the drums the guitars the acoustics the string sections that light sheen of reverb on the lead vocals on so many tracks here all of it reads classic it's all very well produced and engineered and occasionally reminds me of stuff Danger Mouse has done in the past with the likes of The Black Keys on records like brothers or attack and release so this small change in aesthetic for Michael's music has actually meant a lot more appeal for me personally and I think Michael realizes the power in this newfound sound as well because there are quite a few vocal performances on this one that feel bolder on the front cover here he is not presented in shadow or not presented at all he is now looking like an emperor and considering this thing as a self-titled you have to assume that for Michael this must be some kind of defining moment for his identity as an artist and that's something I definitely sense in comparison with his previous records which just don't come off as confident as forthright the opening track you ain't the problem feels a lot more up front than a great deal of Michael's discography so far with its buzzing guitar leads it's zany lalalala background vocals Michael's lead vocal melody which zigzags in a very interesting way this mix of sounds feels equal parts tongue-in-cheek but also deathly serious it's an urgent but catchy blend of so many prevailing and revolutionary sounds from the 60s so that's how the record opens up how the record closes is with the very psychedelic dramatic string back ballad light which is a very moody but enjoyable finale for the project so strong finish strong beginning but everything in the middle is a bit a bit of a mixed bag especially these interlude tracks on the album I can appreciate that Michael wanted to create some cinematic through ways in the tracklist that made this album feel like an experience I think they could have been more evocative or creative though like the piano joint intro or the hero intro both of which sound like slowed down bits of music from the oncoming track that they're teasing pretty much musical extensions of these songs but again slowed down granted the audio on piano joint intro is enhanced with some very dramatic vocal harmonies and ominous drones so this one doesn't seem quite so pointless however the hero intro yeah this is just Michael's voice and guitar but like slowed down and I get literally nothing hearing this track transition into the actual song it's referencing and why these two songs are teased in this very specific way but no other tracks here I'm not sure there's also the loving the people interlude which I do enjoy the vocal snippet on some of the backing instrumentation too but the guitar solo on this interlude it's bad it's really bad it's sloppy beyond belief thank God it's short as far as abstract and transitional moments with great instrumentation and a justice message are concerned the best example is probably another human being the last leg of which with the very dark drones and the news report audio almost feels like something off of a god speed record but it still doesn't add that much to the overall sequence of these tracks for me personally so while the interludes on this thing may mostly be unnecessary the core tracks for the most part are very good like the song rolling one of the catchiest tracks here head bobbing groove very classic warm bassline strong theme melody - it's a very even blend of psychedelic rock and soul there's a little Sly and the Family Stone on this one a little Hendrix I would even say a little Creedence Clearwater Revival it's great then there's piano joint which i think is Michael's most powerfully sad song by a mile the piano progression on this track is great the strings are amazing they aren't super heavy they're not super in-your-face they add a subtle but effective backdrop to what Michael was doing on the piano what Michael is doing with his voice the sound is so stark bold somber it's lyrically simple but it's sentiment is still powerful the song hero from what I can read in lyrics sees Michael struggling with his image as an artist in a public figure what does Michael need to do to be seen as a hero or a larger-than-life icon being put on a pedestal building yourself into something you're not dying a hero's death these are ideas that this track explores pretty well and it does this against some incredible production a great tune very urgent and psychedelic folk rock with an instantaneously catchy vocal rhythm my hero my hero now the song living in denial feels like a pure soul throw back a soul hit single from decades and decades and decades ago it's very Isley's it's very temptations the grand show of horns the warm clunky bass that classic reverb just filling up the mix it's euphoric to the point where the track makes up for some of Michaels vocal shortcomings there are moments on this track where I think volume wise and delivery wise he could come off a bit bolder there's still very melancholic tone to his voice that you can't help but relate to though the track final days is the last track outside of the closer that really wowed me on this project it's one of the most undeniably modern songs in the mix here but aesthetically it's still presented in a very classic fashion the bustling beat the very smooth chord progression on this track the Moody atmosphere all of it reads more like something that would appear on a Radiohead record as opposed to what Michael typically comes off as being influenced by but again Michaels voice and danger Mouse's production makes it feel like it's all coming from a time where it just didn't exist it's like a really beautiful anachronism for sure in the tracklist there are songs that are pretty underwhelming I've been dazed feels like it is way too deep in a daze the songs solid ground dips also into a similarly dreary well as piano joint but gets less results the sequencing across the record also feels like a bit of a mess though that could have a lot to do with the interludes not being all that great overall I would say this is a very good record though Michael is sounding more charismatic than ever more compelling than ever the production is the best he has been on so far the songs are some of the best he's delivered so far the classic blend of psychedelic rock and Foulke and soul is great there are some pretty noticeable flaws on this record but nothing that kept me from truly enjoying it feeling a decent to a strong seven on this one

auy8wEk7Fww,yeah hi everyone trim Denis Boitano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new fka twigs record Magdalen singer-songwriter fka twigs she's back new album finally following up her groundbreaking contribution to the world of alternative R&B LP 1 back in 2014 it's been 5 years and even though twigs hasn't spent the entirety of that time silent listeners have been in the dark long enough to not really know where she's going to take her next record and the experimental R&B wave that twigs originally wrote in on is kind of gone at this point not to say the sound and influence isn't still there it's just that it's given away to so many other things now honestly I can't say I was too excited to give this new twigs album a listen mostly because I found some of the bigger teaser tracks to this record to be underwhelming or unlikable the track holy terrain featuring future just feels like a really awkward attempt at a commercial crossover and with loads of producers on it even though the beat doesn't sound that varied the future placements and ad-libs just are not necessary I cry I cry I cry I cry and the guys performance on the track is average at best you would think that since future is being given such an unlikely placement on this track he would pull out all the stops but no I do like some passages of the instrumental on this track I do like twigs vocal performance even though some of the vocal melodies feel muddled in the overly wordy lyrics and then we have the track home with you which had so much potential with its experimental instrumentation with its Radiohead ish piano chords but the way twigs vocals are treated on this track the way they're processed the effects laid onto them it's terrible it's so grating and so distorted is there a chorus on this too it's hideous beyond the effects I like that it sounds as if twigs is trying to be more expressive vocally on this project but I just can't stand a listen to this what's worse is the track works in multiple parts and none of those parts seem to come together they neither segue into each other effectively or they just end abruptly and then give way to a new part by the time the thing ends it's so unfulfilled Hollow it's built up little to no momentum even off the parts that are likable like that one passage with the gorgeous swell of woodwinds and synth bass it's so odd this is the only track that uses vocal effects this heavily and the only track structurally that just seems like a total mess I guess I'm happy that's the case because nearly every other track on this thing I think is good too great the only other major issues I have with the project honestly is cellophane which I loved as a teaser but as a closing track it just feels so anticlimactic I mean what I love about the track is it's so unbearably tragic with its sombre pianos and its hushed heartbroken vocals those refrains throughout the track don't do it for you but even though I love the tune love the lyrics love many passages of this song it has a non ending which leaves the finish of this album feeling very Hollow and the flow of the record for me instrumentally and narrative Lee is not really anything to freak out about either I think you could arrange these tracks in a few different ways and basically get the same results I mean don't get me wrong Thousand Eyes is very distinctly an opener with a lot of very mystical curious and shy vocals and instrumentation really lures you in it doesn't give too much away it makes you want more it's the ultimate art pop tease after a great tone setting intro the very disorienting home with you isn't the best contrast the very sleepy and repetitive but slowly swelling day bed toward the end of the record doesn't fit all that nicely up against one of the other quietest songs on the album The Closer either I do like the contrast presented in a lot of the lyrics on this track though at least in isolation I think most of the songs on this record are enjoyable the song sad day is a gorgeous track for twigs with a very clear stylistic pivot twigs very much moves away on this track from those subverted R&B grooves and chords off of LP one and she is firmly housed with an art pop territory right now and pulling from some very specific and obvious places to mostly Kate Bush the sound palette on sad day may be cold future and dark but the vocals are Kate Bush all the way that vibrato that regal but light tone twigs also really laying on her English accent and the Kate Bush worship on this record isn't entirely a bad thing I think twigs embodies the influence well even if I think it makes this record a tad bit less original than LP one and even if there is a bit of vocal overlap here and there I think twigs arrives at a lot of very different artistic conclusions than Bush ever did instrumentally songwriting wise lyrically for example this track features all of these glitchy noisy twittering passages of percussion and electronic instrumentation a lot of really cool progressions to the Kate Bush worship continues on to the track Mary Magdalene as well although after a somewhat Laurie Anderson inspired intro with a very bare and robotic vocal intro that is reminiscent of Oh Superman what's to come after this though is one of the most powerful moments on the entire record not only because of twigs very dynamic vocal performance but also because of the beautiful dynamic well-structured and ever-evolving instrumental here the lyrics are also pretty high impact as twigs gets I think more conceptual here than she is at any other point on the project with her words dealing directly in the perception of in the nature of women using Mary Magdalen story in history to explore these themes in a very smart way later I'm loving the tracks psychedelic vocal effects as well as IDM inspired instrumental passages it is very Bjork but still tasteful meanwhile the track fallen alien is a legitimate banger and maybe the most out-there track on the entire record if not only for its bright chilling and sharp chorus samples and fat base hits which kind of sound like something from Kanye Izzy's us it's very easy twigs vocals at the intro of the song are so freaky and stiff really embody the the feel of an alien trying to a moat on a human level but the singing lets loose and when I say lets loose she is borderline shrieking on this track her vocals the instrumental give off this supremely sinister vibe that I love I don't think fka twigs has proven herself on this album to be the most skilled vocalist I think a lot of her appeal comes down to weird breathy gimmicks and strange vocalizations but still I think she comes off incredibly expressive and very out there on this record in a way that is compelling beautiful intriguing the song mirrored heart is another highlight for me it sets a very bittersweet song against some somewhat awkward clunky instrumentation but the lyrics and the writing at the core of all of it are so beautiful and so great that they shine through all the weird bits of sound orbiting it and how again clunky all of it sounds becomes kind of a selling point a unique characteristic some of Twiggs best material so far is on Magdalene no doubt about that for sure that's what's feeling a great deal of the hype behind this new album which honestly I think is mostly justified I like it but is it twigs most consistent record so far no is it one of the most enigmatic or groundbreaking art pop records of the decade not really as special and as stunning as some of the vocals here are as respectable as the updates on the forms of Bjork and Kate Bush are there are some real guts in this tracklist here and again not that crazy about the flow there are a lot of great individual tracks here but as an album I don't really think this thing is greater than the sum of its parts I'm feeling a light two decent seven on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please

4tMn-cTP_wQ,a little hat on my head oh that little hat a man hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for a review of the new West Side gun mixtape Hitler where's Hermes 7 anyway this is the new buzz building mixtape from Buffalo rapper Westside gun first time I'm doing a focused review of his work on the channel even though he has been dropping projects for years now and effectively putting Buffalo on the hip-hop map and he's not alone in that because it's also thanks to his cohorts on the Grizelda Records label Conway Benny the butcher they all recently inked a deal with Shady Records and should have a collaborative project out sooner than you think and even though Grizelda records is mostly an underground phenomenon at this point they are turning some big heads in the industry whether you're talking about Freddie Gibbs and at doom Questlove jay-z just about every music writer in rap so even in the middle of the build-up to their shady debut Griselda is keeping up their usual output especially Gunn who seems to be the most prolific and this is just after dropping the sixth installment of this mixtape series last year a full-length album earlier this year this tapes been getting a lot of press at seize gun building his name up even further with some celebrated names like currency Fat Joe DJ Drama we have production from the likes of DJ Green Lantern also static select uh also Alchemist of course there are plenty of placements for his brothers and arms on this project to Benny the butcher and Conway now listen to a West Side gun project and you'll notice a very distinct style and set of themes right away guns very high voices very high nasal voice is instantaneously attention-grabbing for better or for worse his wild inflections are pretty unmistakable even if they aren't entirely original because there is something about his rap style that reminds me of a very specific era in Ghostface Killah 's discography like the early 2000s era pretty Tony album bulletproof wallets especially supreme clientele though gun kind of makes that creative connection for the audience already with his record last year supreme lion tell guns flows on this tape and most of his projects aren't super fast or skilled every once in a while he's not afraid to slightly slide off tempo or stretch a vowel to its breaking point and he never holds back on his trademark ad-lib even if it's mixed so high it's overshadowing his main verse get used to that so guns delivery can feel a little sloppy sometimes is that intentional probably more than anything the focus on this project seems to be on just sounding as grimy as possible in his best moments a gun exceeds on that front to the point where it makes up for his shortcomings everywhere else and those shortcomings are mostly lyrical or structural truth be told gun is not really much of a songwriter dude can rap dude can write but build a song out and create different sections or passageways not really in fact there are tracks on this thing that are so under written they feel just not finished or just like they're utterly pointless motifs mere impressions of songs that only exist to capture a fleeting vibe and then evaporate into nothing while there's something about guns style that reads classic reads old-school a time when there was substance in hip-hop there are a lot of tracks on this tape that are just as forgettable just as breezy as your average SoundCloud kid doing some auto-tune riffs over a generic trap beat what is love you if not that what is size 42 if not that Conny sun gan deck even if that track does have one of the better beats here and there are moments where these tracks are so bare so simple they remind me of other east coast rappers that also like to play it strip back rock Marciano kah but somehow gun doesn't manage to achieve the same minimal appeal now as far as the writing goes on this project the bars I wouldn't say they're terrible gun can write some verses but it's all pretty OneNote when you observe it across the entirety of a whole project there's a lot of references to high-fashion cocaine dealing violence one thing that makes guns writing sound slightly more eccentric than any other rapping about these same things is he works in a lot of wrestling references and not just giving nods to Ric Flair in the way your average rapper does these days so for sure this makes guns stand out that in his attempts to blatantly cross unfiltered thuggish nough swiff high class decadence I mean just look at the cover on this thing the ski mask the Balenciaga coat also if we go back to Supreme bla Intel we have the gun the Fendi Stocking going over his face like he's gonna rob somebody after wearing a designer stocking so I do commend and respect Griselda heavily for being so consistent with the visuals with the marketing it's actually pretty artsy and kind of reeks of authenticity too I mean certainly Conway Benny and Gunn have given us no reason to question that up until now but I feel like I have compliments and compliments and compliments for everything other than what is happening on the tracks on this tape because for me at the end of the day it really only sounds cool and intriguing on the surface for the most part gun doesn't seem to be able to or at least care about wanting to write an intro a bridge hook a topic a narrative I don't know he just kind of blurts out whatever loosely connected bars he can string together it's all just a non-sequitur soup in a way that reminds me of what action bronson was doing on some of his breakthrough projects like blue chips as well as dr. Lecter obviously with way fewer food references don't get me wrong there are moments on this thing we're gonna come off genuinely charismatic Andy says some genuinely sharp braggadocious stuff - like a oh don't try me Cartier's came out in 90 find me in the cocaine spot looking I see connect to Nomi on the first name basis I'm looking tasteless Chanel off the runway you on the waiting list we just slick but also kind of plain there's a lot of slang but nothing you haven't heard before if you've been on every major coke rap record since the 90s the wordplay is very light on this project if here at all on occasion Gunn will say something totally out there a wild simile a weird scenario supreme catcher mask looking like Mike Piazza Paul Smith fish we rained down with the choppers but very little of it adds up across the tape because of all the topical Dunnan sees the lack of coherent songs and of course there are plenty of spots on this thing we're gonna Zack Chua Lee overshadowed like on the track banana yacht where gun is actually barely on this track it's really a song by his feature guest who raps a couple of verses and gun pops and occasionally he also doesn't appear until the very end of the track it's possible for whatever reason he dedicates most of the songs runtime to one of the most comatose verses boldi James has ever recorded every Benny verse on this project though is great not only are his features in my opinion the best on this entire tape but they're actually better than many of his verses on his recent plugs I met EP especially the verse on the back end of lucha bros that signing skills line was hilarious but these are only a few of many moments on this project where gun ends up being one of the least interesting things on his own track there were only a handful of songs on this tape that stood out to me as being supremely good which is usually when gun himself is hitting a consistent flow or we're getting a great beat or the guest kind of carries the track a little bit like on Kelly's corner with that Joe or on cool G with Conway and Benny which has such good chemistry on it it has me psyched for that collaborative record or on Undertaker versus Goldberg which has a great beat switch after the first leg I love the woozy transition of synths and horns that fat dusty ass beat but as long as we're talking about production on this thing it is kind of a mixed bag every once in a while here we get some dirty fat classic hip hop drums creative use of sense awesome sample manipulations other times instead we get a very stale sample loop just playing over and over and over and over again the track banana yeah this singular string sample here is is this production is this a beat also lucha Bros and mind you I do like this track but this one sole sample playing again and again and again with only a few change ups it's mind-numbing and look there are some artists out there that I think pull off this this minimal repetitive instrumental thing very well but usually when they do it the sounds they bring to the table are a bit more evocative or the lyrics they bring to the table are a bit more thoughtful or there's a narrative or there's a concept they make up for that instrumental simplicity by providing other things to stimulate your mind but with Gunn there's not really another layer beyond what you're being presented with on the surface look there are a lot of tracks on this tape despite West Side guns very standout delivery that to my ears are just unmemorable filler and that goes for the short tracks and some of the longer tracks - honestly the vibe of this tape is the best thing that it has going for it the best thing I think Gunn has going for him across most of his catalogue if that's the wavelength you operate on which there's nothing wrong with that and you want to hear something that sounds a little old grimy dusty cold blooded then give this a shot you'll probably love it and I suppose I don't mind it either if this thing we're playing is somewhere near me I wouldn't be scrambling to turn it off I feel like I'm listening to something I've enjoyed before but now it's being presented to me in a diminished capacity I'm feeling a light too decent five on this one transition have you given this tape up listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Westside gun forever 
LFUkzI_suGY,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the worst and the best tracks of the week they're all linked down below like usual also linked down below is our turntable a blank get a colorful pressing of a record we have reviewed on our channel over there we get kicked back from it supports the channel and everything we do also supporting the channel and everything we do is patreon.com slash the needle drop head over there and get some extra bonus monthly exclusive content patron only let's argues patron only classic album listening parties patreon.com slash the needle drop link down below all right the worst tracks of the week there are quite a few let's go through them one this new track from the new lil mo Z record you guys might remember how underwhelmed I was by his double XL freshmen activities this new track with him featuring trippy red never scared is so mediocre and so boring and so awful and so generic it's really indescribable at this point it's just a really bad woozi Melo trap with no soul or personality whatsoever and that is most likely the case for the entire LP all right we have a new little baby track whoa and yeah he just continues to sound like a young thug impersonator but with less charisma not quite as skilled vocally and very generic trap beat on this one too la rue has a new single out international woman of leisure and it's it's kind of unfortunate because I did love her last full-length LP I was looking forward to a new album when or if it was coming out and the beat on this track is so thin and it's so bad and it's so I guess anxiety inducing and how repetitive and I guess one-dimensional it is I don't really care for a lot of the vocals on the track either however I'm basing most of my dislike of this song on just how terrible the instrumental is this instrumental has got awful and and mostly just because it feels like it's stuck in this constant state of introduction you know what once once it kind of introduces itself it doesn't really grow all that much it's just a very flat flat instrumental that didn't really complement this track in in my opinion at all or really the song that LaRue was trying to bring to the table here so I don't know we also had this kind of a lead track off of dosha cat's new LP hot pink which I hope to be talking about very soon but still cybersex is the name of the track and I mean I've been hearing some tracks here and there from this new LP it seems so far really all over the place and just having a hard time wrapping my head around this track because it just sounds like a kind of watered-down Nicki Minaj impression like this is a song I feel like Nicki Minaj would have dropped in in the mid-2000s the late 2000s no rat rather I want to say late 2000s like in the late 2000s are really not even that this this is like some Super Bass era I would say Nicki Minaj sorry I'm having a hard time kind of placing that chronologically but still and and I don't think doja cat really brings anything interesting to this particular blend of pop rap so I don't know cybersex not really liking it I think it's kind of a little generic moving on from their new new best coast song for the first time yeah it's it's it's just very bad breezy pop rock with completely soulless production God this is this is such plan production the guitars the drums everything just sounds so plain and in an offensive and boring just kind of sounds like hanging out in an Ikea all day I just don't care for it and we also have a new track from Beck dark places I don't know how Beck gets seemingly more and more and more boring with every new single release it is heartbreaking this coming from somebody who used to love this man's output in the 90s and you know still to this day I rep heavy records like one foot in the grave i rep heavy records like the information which i think is one of his last you know great and also underrated records too but this I I just cannot I cannot I just can I just can't it's just it's just so boring it's just so boring alright let's get into the tracks I thought were met not blown away by them is certainly worth pointing at and you guys made dig them a little more than me so again pay attention we have a track nerve to reverse the song from a band going by the name of these New South Wales and again newer group they're also kind of like a comedy troupe it's it's a bit of maybe a multimedia kind of thing and this track is some not so bad very rowdy straightforward energized enjoyable punk rock and I don't know I'm just it's I'm kind of liking it I'm kind of liking it I'm sort of waiting for something distinct to kind of jump out at me and I'm hoping that that'll be the case when I try out their their new LP and just kind of see what that's all about so nerve to reverse these New South Wales check them out it seems like they have some you know some good things going for them and they're showing a lot of promise Ozzy Osbourne brand-new single the Prince of Darkness himself under the graveyard it's not bad it's not bad Ozzy has put out much worse stuff especially in the 2000s however this track to my ears kind of sounds like a 2000s you know era Ozzy track but what are the good ones you know what one of the good ones I mean it's it's got a kind of very sad and melodramatic intro the harder riffs come in later becomes super big anthemic it's very formulaic we've heard Ozzy put out tracks like this before but it's not bad it's not bad moving on from their ksi YouTube hero ksi just won that amazing match against Logan Paul right ksi beat Logan Paul KS Atlanta lemon lemon ksi Logan Paul yeah he'd beat the crap out of Logan Paul that's amazing that's fantastic I love it I love it I love it anyway he has a new track out amazingly featuring Rick Ross a little baby and I guess sx1 artist I'm not familiar with on here unfortunately but it's not great but it's it's a pretty competent track banger with a melodic chorus seems kind of thrown and cobbled together seems like you just kind of put this track out for the clout but it turned out not bad and it's kind of climbing up the the Apple music charts right now so I don't know good for him good for him came out with a popular track got some big names on it down like that ksi Jenny Beth of savages Fame is coming through with some solo material here I'm the man and it's it's a very abrasive cacophonous piece of almost industrial rock music I think there are points where the songwriting and the messaging really sort of gets lost in the chaos of what Beth is doing on this track but I still do like the the ruckus she's stirring here hopefully this is a taste of what's to come hopefully we get more sooner rather than later Jenny Beth I'm the man kind of digging it you know potential potential free nationals Anderson packs band they've been put out track after track after track after track with lots of different guests a range of different guests this new one is featuring Sid of the internet fame and it's very smooth very soulful very groovy pretty inoffensive but it's got a good vibe to it also club nights from the band dum this is a group I just kind of came across on Bandcamp Club nights is the name of the track also the name of the project they've just recently put out and it's a pretty good herky-jerky somewhat offbeat post-punk music if you like bands like parquet courts you'll probably fuck with this pretty heavy give it a try give it a shot we also have dave east new track off of his project survival this one features a little baby nightshift is the title of it and it's it's okay I mean every time I hear Davis music it sounds alright you know he's a competent rapper he seems to pick beats that aren't total trash but don't really stick out in any way shape or form and his writing typically just feels okay to me you know some similes here and there that are worth an eye roll but nothing that's like the worst thing I've ever heard you know he's just very middle-of-the-road to my ears and frankly despite how many times I've tried Dave East music every time he drops a new project and I get a few requests here and there to try it I still to this day have not been able to commit any not even a single second of his music to memory so mostly this track is going to be in one ear and out the other just like every other one and I don't know I mean obviously there are people out there who fucking with this dude's stuff heavily I mean they must be in order for him to be continuing in the fashion that he is but his music just does not really do too much for me frankly moving out from their dad who's this guy hey if you've been on YouTube a long time you know you know dad you know dad and he has a new track out featuring Danny Brown and it's all about a dad feeling good that feels good it's a song about what what's making dad feel good you know just kicking back watch watch some tube that sort of thing it's it's a weird dance rap track that's very tongue-in-cheek and very silly a shout-out to dead shout-out to dad clipping clipping has come through with a bit of a post album non album excuse me post album non-album single aqua code data breaks Shabazz Palaces featured on the song I could see why this would not have made it onto their new LP because this is not really stick anywhere into that album or could have not stuck anywhere into that record conceptually as this is not a very scary song it's it it is a really weird concept it's it's one of the weirdest concepts of any clipping song and truly and honestly it's the concept that I'm not even gonna get into it because I'd be spoiling too much I want you guys to try it for yourselves because it's one of the weirdest ideas that I think clipping is put into a song and it's just maybe a bit too much for me like okay guys like I get it you could do a song about like almost fucking anything but that doesn't mean yes I do like some of the glitchy elements of the instrumental though though some of the some vocal bits dahveed's flow I think is just kind of funny on this track and it's it's it out there song I mean I respect that clipping continues to you know really ride the fray I mean they they're just afraid the fuck out you know like they're the only group in hip-hop or really anywhere is it right now doing songs like this so you know respect for that of course even if I'm not super crazy about it still respect Beach slang covering another track from the new Beach slang record Tommy in the 80s is the name of this new one and it's it's a badass hard rock in tune production is a little blown out to the point where I think more than nuances and and likable qualities of the song and the vocals get kind of hidden and obscured in a way I'm not crazy about but still great energy good performance and you know just generally a likeable and fun fund is what I want to say fun alright let's get into the best tracks of the week tracks that I thought were the best the tracks that really stood out to me first off let's give a shout out to this you boa demo it's a demo you bow as an artist I've covered on the channel before if you are unfamiliar with their music with her music do go onto my channel look up this artist and look you're in for a harrowing experience with the latest record off of this project now what's also been teased via social media is a another project very soon not predicted to be as grand or as conceptual and experienced as the last record but we're getting a bit of a teaser and a taster with this little little demo here untitled 25 10 19 and it's pretty heavily layered and since it's a little disorienting toward the end comes to a really great climax give it a try give it a shot it's experimental as hell - alright poly Rosalia new single it's a banger banger alert and it's a one of the weirdest and darkest songs she has come out with yet I'm loving it super super super huge amazing respect for the flamenco Queen not that there's a whole lot of flamenco in this track either I mean obviously with Rosalia there's a little bit of that in everything she does but this is primarily a very groovy and dark pop song that's actually a little freakish - and loving that she's really heading in a unique direction with this track so just a huge respect amazing also this track over here which I caught from I think it was the Twitter from 100x because Dylan I think did production for this track over here to us from an artist who goes by the name of a Ravenna gold and keep going don't stop featuring little West and it's a funny little I guess blend of pop and hip-hop but it has that it hasn't it weird outsider kind of freaky colorful playful 100x personality to it that so many of us enjoyed off of a thousand gex so loving hearing that play out here in a way with a different artist and loving hearing I guess this thing that I'm enjoying with 100x evolved into its it may be its own little miniature trend you know influencing other artists and then getting them to make pop music but supremely out there as well so liking that liking that makes me excited alright poppy has come through Blood Money is the name of her new track and music video it is badasses fuck industrialists fuck loudest fuck blown out as fuck and [Laughter] it's not so much the groove metal and new metal vibes of her last big track this this is so much more dark and abrasive and very very freakin edgy edgy AF my boys a GAF I'm just like in the dark direction I think the music videos little campy probably some some huge Kill Bill vibes on it I'm not too crazy about the visuals but still loving the incredibly abrasive and experimental sounds that she's bringing forward for sure Poppy's going to find a new direction at some point in the future post this but I think what she's doing right now is very interesting all right Lucy Dacus has come through with another single in this series of tracks that she's been dropping throughout 2019 this new one is titled fool's gold and I wasn't even I'm aware of this and its original to I guess all these tracks that she has been dropping have been tied into or in reference to her inspired by a holiday that they were released around and I guess the inspiration for this one is New Year's which is actually kind of cool it's a beautiful tune Lucy's vocals on it sound great she has that wonderfully deep mature sound to her voice that definitely makes her stick out in the current singer-songwriter field give it a try give it a shot it's lovely alright mirages newest track from Jessie where it is a beautifully groovy dancey single it's a quality single good dancey grooves somewhat pristine light on the ears as well as a lot of her material tends to be so pretty groovy and euphoric I'll say that all right I want to point out a remix here of a track from gorilla toss they've come out with a little a little small remix project of moments from their twisted crystal project this new one over here meteor meteorological that's the track that's being remixed it's the cotan remix and yeah just some strong alternative house vibes coming off this remix of this track excuse me it's actually kind of interesting to hear gorilla music pursue the gorilla tosses music treated in this way fka twigs sad day song from her newest record Magdalene and not going to get too much into it because I plan on talking about this album very soon so you will get my opinion on this track and the rest of them as soon as the review on this jobs but you can know that this track I did love thought it was really good alright also shout out to Clarke whose comes through the new banger it's it's kind of a kind of a weird techno excursion a legacy Pet is the name of it goes pretty hard and is cold AF and robotic AF and I'm just loving the cold dark vibes off of this one and the black lifts they have a new record coming out in 2020 like the first thing next year and believe it or not it is if you can already tell from the last teaser which I which I didn't make any assumptions because the black lips have done all all types of tracks over the course of their career but I guess between this one that they've just dropped which is titled gentlemen and the last teaser that they drop that I thought was really good I guess they're doing a country album it's an honest to god black lips country album so again not the first time they ever dabbled in or referenced country music on their records but for them to do an entire album of country I think is a pretty cool and again gentlemen is the name of the track I think it's really good song and excited to hear the the lips go in this direction and Andy Scott has a new project out which is actually pretty you know amazing I'm just noticing now that this is like a five legged six legged zebra that's pretty cool but anyway if you like your electronic music dark and cerebral and heavily textured as Andy Scott's music tends to be then I would give this new collection of tracks a try give this track specifically versi a shot because it's really good and also want to give a shout out to the injury reserve remix of 745 sticky from 100 X it is very out there huge respect to Richy for doing what doing what he does on this track vocally a huge shout out to the production which is nuts I feel like in a way injury reserve made a stranger remix than even AG cooked it when he did a remix of 100 X you know a few weeks or a week or so ago so um shout out to the remix respect to 100 X and their influence the ripples that they've been making throughout the industry the connections they've been making throughout the industry and I think that is our weekly track roundup everyone hopefully you guys got some good recommendations out of this video they're all linked down below with

UtL5_lw0xtI,ah hey everyone anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for a review of the new gangster album one of the best yet together DJ premier and guru as Gangstar dropped some of the most essential hip-hop of the 90s had an amazing run through that decade in a way they helped evolve the genre out of its rudimentary golden age in the 80s with more nuanced jazzy instrumentation boom bap beats conscious lyrics and cold-blooded flows that were heavily influenced by the likes of Rakim now of course gangster weren't the only artists around this time pushing these ideas pushing the envelope in general KMD De La Soul Tribe Called Quest main source which are only a few examples but Gang Starr was as early to the party as almost anybody and certainly helped lay the groundwork for more hardcore sounds to come for anyone who happens to be out of the know DJ Premier didn't just produce beats for Gang Starr his production graced tracks from numerous classic hip-hop albums over this time period Mobb Deep's the infamous nas's Illmatic ready to die ARS ones return of the boom bap also jay-z's reasonable doubt gang stars transition into the bling era in 2003 with the owners was pretty good certainly not as bad as some of their other 90s contemporaries still primo and guru decided to call it quits around the halfway point of the decade and they both kept dropping music respectively that is until guru passed tragically in 2010 now it would be safe to assume with almost 10 years since that point the chances of a new gang star album are just non-existent but DJ Premier actually made it happen with an assembly of beats and tracks he's been producing and structuring topped with vocal recordings of grew that were laid around 2005 to 2009 it's pretty ambitious to make a brand new album not a compilation not a b-sides collection and album under these circumstances even with the best stuff at your fingertips how much workable material could prima have possibly had I mean after all one of the best yet is gang stars shortest record so far by a mile the tracklist is also slightly padded out with some interludes and there are quite a few features on this project too I mean I don't think there are too many features and I think a majority of the features on this thing are very quality but if you're one of those sticklers that thinks a record can't have too many other artists on it you might be unhappy with the number of guests and again I can't say the number of people on this record bugs me all that much because for the most part they all stay pretty faithful to Gangstar sound and vision whether you're talking about artists here who are essentially voices from gang stars past or new faces whose work is obviously inspired by gang stars legacy J Cole Royce to 5/9 and throwing it back we have jeru the damaja on here we have tallied quali on here q-tip mo P big hug credit to Prima though for doing his best with what I think he had access to because this thing does feel like a legitimately new album it doesn't feel like a bunch of warmed over leftovers it flows really well like an album should and he came through with quite a few highlights there's the track lights out with mo P who have had connections to Gang Starr for years the track is pretty much a perfectly crafted boom bat banger with chilling piano chords epic shots of strings also savage performances from both guru and mo P that lights out gang chorus lights out is incredible guru on this track not only as a killer verse but it's packed with a lot of good one-liners also a very good refrain to that one bar about rappers joining sag because they're actors I liked it the following track bad name which has grown on me a little bit since I first heard it is is eerily relevant given the current rap landscape the Primo beat here is basic but classic guru is resting on a pretty tried and true flow that seems heavily influenced by Rakim it's like something we would have previously heard on step in the arena and gurus bars on this track are essentially about hip-hop losing its spirit its fundamentals to materialism commercialism it's so relevant it doesn't feel like an old guru track but more like a broadcast from beyond the grave much in the same way many tracks on Bowie's black star fell I get a similar vibe from the tracks so many rappers later on the record which is essentially about the struggles of existing in the music industry one-hit wonders show business in general we have the track hitman featuring q-tip which topically is a bit of an odd detour the track is literally about a hitman a mercenary the instrumental on this one is equal parts grimy and theatrical it's like listening to the hip-hop equivalent of a short film q-tips refrain on this one is a little silly I wish he had a verse or something but the selling point of the track is really gurus verses which go into grave detail over how cold-blooded and calculated this hitman is he's secretive he's shadowy watch out all of these tracks all these moments contribute to a pretty quality first leg of this album there's no material so far that's as thorough or as creatively genius as mass appeal or tons of guns or a moment of truth but so far all of gurus lyrics are focused topical pretty well written even though these songs aren't super long I'm not coming away from most of them wanting more and I think a lot of that comes down to primo structuring these tracks as well as he does it sounds like primo put a lot of forethought into nearly everything going into this record and the same goes for most of the guests royce two five nine generally might not be one of my favorite rappers but he does drop one of my favorite guest verses on this project I love his expressive delivery I also think it's great how primo interacts with his needle drop line with that little record scratch and the second leg of his verse becomes this beautiful tribute to guru that line about his ashes being on the boards is pretty incredible also very impressed with Jay Cole on family and loyalty too I think he put together one of his best features ever on this one second only to maybe some of the stuff he's done with jid where he's really doing his best to try to keep up with him the drums on this one feel a little light a little dry almost like something that could have been on the owners but these super dramatic strings and pianos on this track are too pretty for words guru's hook is also fantastic talking about diamonds and using it as a metaphor for things that last or should last like loyalty family in a way it's kind of a shame it's been stashed away for all this time following this is maybe my least favorite track on the entire project get together which is an attempt at a smooth flirty sensual jam I think gurus bars on the track are pretty slick charismatic what I don't really like here honestly is Primo's very weak attempt at making a luxurious instrumental with these plinky keyboard chords that sound like a cat jumping off of a piano there's also Neos hook here which is obnoxious the line about this being as much Spanish as I know is annoying MIDI Scott on the track is fine not blowing my mind or anything but I understand the need for a female voice to sort of come in and play counterpoint to what guru is saying on the track and in for the most part I again I think she's I think she does well I think she does well it's just everything else surrounding her verse and gurus verse that is so painfully unlikable in the last leg I think the record starts to waver a little bit telecoil ease guest verse in my opinion is just sounding very off I don't know what it is about his voice that just doesn't sound him that soulful warm rasp that he's usually known for those smooth and nimble flows that I've always loved from his music in the past just don't carry over onto this feature he sounds like you sticks out like a sore thumb in the mix and not in a good way the track bring it back here features a very cool verse from guru but I'm not sure I really needed this to just be a 50 second detour you know what I mean it's it's one of the only moments on the record that truly feels like wow this you this is like literally just some leftover work here and you just tossed it into the record when you really could have built it out a little bit and made this album a bit more robust the track take flight is very good though with its orchestral samples with its features from Freddy Fox and big showed the track being the latest installment of gang stars militia series essentially calling back to the first one they did also with Freddy Fox and big Suge so kind of bring in a full circle and the song bless the mic is the closer here and it's a pretty interesting change of pace as the beat here is very Spacey very ambient gurus voice is treated in a way where it sounds like again I'll go back to that phrase a broadcast from beyond the grave it's like he's giving us advice or just giving us perspective from where he's at now after having left this plane of existence also it's utterly to have all of these samples of rock him bless the mic bless the mic bless the mic the track is obviously a tribute to gang Starr's legacy guru's legacy but obviously referencing back to another great MC - overall this thing was a very good project turned out way better than I thought it was going to give in its posthumous given just how long it's been since guru has passed away how long it's been since Gang Starr wasn't was a thing even if there are some weak moments here and there I think one of the best yet does stay very true to what Gang Starr musically stylistically philosophically was all about this projects a very good celebration of that and also the artistic era of rap music that Gang Starr came from I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this one transition have you given this album

Ue7WGgA_2_Q,ah hey everyone a teeny bit tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new on amount of gucci album u.s.a yes this is the newest full-length album from chiptune and bit pop outfit Anamanaguchi and USA is their first record in about 6 years finally following up 2013's endless fantasy a project that at the time I was highly anticipating especially given some of the amazing non-album singles that led up to that point airbrushed mess my skateboard will go on aurora tracks that really painted a bright future for the bands fusions of pop rock and 8-bit music sadly endless fantasy despite highlights being on this project ended up being a little bloated one-dimensional I hoped we would get another record sooner rather than later but considering the previous Anamanaguchi album dropped in 2009 I guess I should have anticipated wait and it's not like the band to spent this entire time doing nothing in 2016 and 17 they did drop volumes 1 and 2 of their capsule silence 24 soundtracks they put out some singles Luke's knife city was certainly a little active either way Anamanaguchi is back now fully online with a new record and it's out via polyvinyl which is pretty cool the band has trimmed things back a little bit to a very manageable 14 tracks and 52 minutes I already went into this record loving the singles air online great teaser shimmering glitchy synthesis 1 manipulated vocal bits some thumping beats that sound like something out of a synth wave song and then some crunchy synth slap bass that feels like a Daft Punk relic it's an epic inspiring totally danceable electronic music composition and of course given some of the 8-bit tones and the synth patches the whole thing sounds incredibly video game music influenced specifically a golden age sitting between late era nes and early era n64 it's like I'm listening to the soundtrack to a 2d space shooter mixed with a racing game mixed with an excellent Japanese RPG we also have the equally good lorem ipsum which kicks things off with these eerie heavily processed lead vocals it sounds like a course of alien singing quietly into my ear but the song does bring another thick grand explosive display of 8-bit sense booming distorted drums as well but the percussion on this track sounds live and gets pretty aggressive too the track has an amazing build incredible melodies the whole thing sounds like I'm saving the fucking world with my closely knit group of super-powered anime friends we're all combining our lasers to create like a giant rainbow blast into an asteroid that's going to just crash into the planet and kill everyone the final climax of the track leads to this very dystopian droney ambient outro it's really intriguing especially when what sounds like ocean waves start creeping into the mix as well as some deep unsettling ghostly bass so between these two tracks these two teasers there there's a lot more versatility than there was I think throughout a great deal of endless fantasy so given that I was pretty excited to hear the rest of this album I dig the curious and strange intro that leads into lorem ipsum the slowly climbing and falling synth notes the digitized chance of u-s-a it's one of those introductions that works incredibly well just by virtue of being so weird you wonder what's going to come after past this point the band just keeps delivering one high-octane 8-bit banger after another the song CRT woods features these 50-foot high walls of burning synthesizers I'm loving the mix of sequenced as well as organic drums on this project it gives what on mana Gucci does a sometimes rigid and sometimes punky feel the mixing of all the synth layers on this track for as dense as they are is excellent I'm also loving just how nostalgic the tone of these since are just kind of hits me right in that gamer vein but this track and many others on here are still far from being purely an exercise in nostalgia as much as memory plays a role in the concept of this project because the heavy bass the punchy beats the panoramic mixing this thing is unquestionably a modern record the song sunset biplane is one of a handful of tracks here the features guest vocal in this particular case it is Caroline Lufkin I think her breathy vocal performance on this track is okay I mostly act by how her voice sounds mixed into the track in a way where it just feels like it's riding on top of the instrumental it's not in the thick of all the other instrumentation which makes the vocals feel despite how quietly sound overpowering in a really awkward way it's even worse on the track on my own featuring Hannah which by comparison I think is a much better tune with much better singing but once again the band just can't seem to get a good vocal mix on this project even with arguably the biggest guest on the project Hatsune Miku the legendary Vocaloid singer really software and in a voice bank but whatever Hatsune A's voice turns up all over at multiple points of the song PSX which is actually one of my favorite tracks on the project I love the slickly melodies on this track the bubbly 8-bit arpeggios and the driving riffs the Vocaloid bits do add a lot of character to this very aggressive track but they are amongst some of the quietest sounds in the mix you would think that it's it's a bit of a feature here that they would be displayed more prominently it's not the worst thing because that Vocaloid sound does tend to melt in with all the other synthetics in the track and it's still a high point on the project still a very energized and exciting and super catchy moment thankfully up to you with me she is the best balanced track vocally on the entire project the singing is very nicely laced into the rest of the instrumental which just makes it easy to enjoy the track sharp beats and richly layered synthesizers it's like rings of multi-coloured hearts swirling in every direction so even though some of these vocal cuts are the album's Achilles heel the highlights still continue the song overriding incorporate given this tracks video game since the very straightforward mid-paced kick snare pattern the epic builds this is like automata Gucci's take on an EDM anthem there's even something a little Porter Robinson about it but given Anamanaguchi has remixed Robinson's music before and I think Robinson is a fan as well that that just kind of makes sense we also have a few very glitchy cinematic interludes that add a lot of character to the flow of this project too whether it be a poofy neolite or speak to you even though it's longer than the other interludes here the tract tears well which does a really good job of setting the stage for the album's grand finale with these monumental synth layers that sound like a hundred orchestras just screaming on top of each other listening to it is like staring into the Sun and we also get a reprise of the us a chance then we have the tracks we die which is effectively the final moment of the album outside of the somewhat ambient outro LOM which I think does a very great job of resolving the album in a beautiful way we die takes its sweet time to evolve out of these fragmented synth passages a very soft beat begins to introduce itself and suddenly everything is following suit orbiting around that and immediately after this it's nothing but plucky 8-bit since roaring bass house inspired kick drums it sounds like if Zedd and Crystal Castles were taking turns beating Master Blaster and now they're finally at the ending credits overall it's a very strong finish to a pretty consistent and creative album which again did have some vocal mixing issues but nothing that derailed the entire LP but seriously what an accomplishment for Anamanaguchi this project is the record sounds and feels great I would say it's a must here for this niche genre and also there are qualities about this record that I think should lead to a transcending outside of the 8-bit world because the melodies the compositions the layering the mixing all around even if the aesthetic of this record is very specific they're really good fundamentals on nearly every cut here it's why I see no reason why fans of EDM or videogame music at large and be getting into this record also instrumental rock fans to don't miss out don't assume the whole 8-bit thing Pinzon amount of gucci on this record to a particular post or genre and that's it because that is merely the banner under which the group explores so many different sounds and styles I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit

n8yFCmjXZeE,oh this new highly suspect album it's not good a highly suspect is a band out of Massachusetts and they've been active for a little more than half this decade now and their past couple of records they were just pretty much a straight alternative rock band sure maybe their last album was a little over produced but there was certainly nothing that was super stand out about much of what the band was doing the one weird totally unexpected thing was that they were signed to 300 entertainment which is primarily known as a rap label I mean some of the biggest artists on there include young thug Megan the stallion T Grizzly Reggie Snow is on there too Fetty WAP was on there as well again outside of that nothing particularly about the band's sound that would make you go WOW or would make you stop in your tracks I know that certainly was the case for me not amazing but certainly not terrible and I do get a lot of requests to listen to their stuff try it out so of course the man comes out with another record I am curious to try it and it is easily one of the worst things I've heard in 2019 and it's unfortunate because I could really tell they were shooting for this more mainstream widely appealing record where creatively so many different ideas and sounds and even features coalesce onto one very unlikely project I mean this thing features not only young thug but also Gojira the metal band Gojira which I don't think any modern popular record has ever done such a thing so I can at least commend the band on the variety and versatility that they are sort of shooting for on this project but God are the performances production songwriting and instrumentals on this record terrible and given just how many ideas or sounds the band are shooting for on this one it's like each crack is doing its own type of terrible it's like really a torture chamber with different sections and pathways and obstacles to make you unhappy from the opening track fly which was almost like a test of my sympathy because yes there are some serious and personally painful issues addressed on this song issues of suicide the issues of abandonment substance abuse issues - but the instrumental is unbearable it's like a combination of AJR imagine dragons in that depressive little peep angle the lyrics are so painfully sophomoric and just surface level they don't really require one to think about what's being said all that much everything is put so plainly it becomes almost excruciating like I wish I had someone to give me some love I wish I had someone to give me a hug I'm sick of the liquor and sick of the drugs I wish I could just stop fucking up which could be a genuine expression of sadness and a cry for help something that Johnny the frontman of the band actually needs but it's it's still not really playing out all that well in song nor do I really care for the tone of the track making this emotional suffering that he's going through into like I don't know a synth afire arena rock anthem the following track 16 doesn't offer much better material with the opening lyrics and the hook it took me 16 years to find you one second to love you seven years to hold you one minute to lose eeeh and what's even worse is the singing switch up on this track the vocals do not really sound much like the vocals on the intro or many of the other tracks here either I would describe the singing on this one as like a combination of Darius Rucker from Hootie and the Blowfish and Anthony Kiedis of Red Hot Chili Peppers we are really seeing those terrible matches of the most cliched sounds of the 90s all over this project later into the lyrics we get these laments about a puppy love essentially being done being over things changing but poetically it does not really improve can't say I'm all that crazy about the overblown very dramatic instrumental even more excruciating is the following freak streak where we get one of the most garish vocals on the entire record be the shit you talk about a shot stupid drama now it's sunny out I'm riding how shut your stupid drama mouth once and why does the instrumental sound like such a cheap piece of just overly touched up synth pop it it is terrible it gets even worse with what I guess you could call maybe a rap verse in the second half where Johnny's vocals get particularly goofy the lyrics on the album just get worse and worse and worse yeah I'm an outlaw baby with a southpaw view Donald's a bitch and Vlad Putin is too what this is like some really bad fo edgy rap metal from the 2000s type of writing here I don't fucking care if you fucking care no one's gonna live forever so you better be prepared not gonna lie that part's pretty Death Grips but it's really that terrible ultra commercial alt-rock soaring chorus quality of it that makes it feel so cheap and almost disingenuous because no after this record I really don't honestly buy into highly suspects apathy I don't think that they don't care there is nothing left field extreme or out there enough about this record to make me feel that all this album serves us is cheap profitable acceptable rock rebellion the track upper drugs is another track about drugs it gives us hints of grungy guitars it's very Cobain inspired I would say a Cobain ripoff at points the whole instrumental feels like an amalgamation of all these 90s sad rock cliches and they're pieced together into this mostly disingenuous Frankenstein monster with even the final moments of the track sounding like something out of Soundgarden Superunknown the track Tetsuo spike is one of a few cuts here that is just an instrumental interlude this one is so crumbly produced and assembled you can essentially take a screenshot of fruity and just paste over it in big impact font music production is my passion and that would be this track after this we start getting some of the album's key features like the cut here with young thug gotta say thugger went way harder on this track than he needed to his vocal here is easily the best vocal on the entire record it's pretty much a big synth back trap ballad that is way too dramatic for words melodramatic I mean things get even worse when Johnny starts performing as a terrible Johnny which I guess is an alias of his that he does on record we get these really bad unbearable ad-libs in the background of what is it dirt boy dirt life dirt bike there's so many ideas that just should have not come out of the studio we then get into the track with Gojira on it SOS which is a hard transition a very hard transition as the previous cut is pretty mellow the intro I imagine kicks off with Gojira dropping in with these thunderous sludgy guitars and drums it is super animalistic I would say way too animalistic for this record as it is abrasive to the point where it sounds hideous and doesn't really fit in with anything else what is even weirder is that immediately after this highly suspect starts working in a song and these guitars that are a blatant Queens of the Stone Age rip off with even Johnny vocally sounding like he's just doing his best Josh Tommy impression like this is literally the equivalent of Greta Van Fleet ripping off Led Zeppelin and for whatever reason on the course of this track the way that it transitions into these super heavy blown-out guitars the production suddenly becomes just so compressed it is unbearable I'm just wondering what what goes into the writing of these tracks because for the most part the song so far and in really for the rest of the record just sound like completely messy sloppy almost random combinations of all these stale rock tropes from bands that I mean are super popular really obvious that you're pulling from these groups like it's it's really actually distracting when there's a moment that sounds exactly like a Red Hot Chili Peppers song when there's a moment that sounds exactly like a Nirvana song when there's a moment that sounds exactly like a Foo Fighter song after this I think the records unbearable qualities let up for just a little bit Arizona is an acoustic ballad that while not amazing is not offensively bad juzo is a decent I guess kind of very ephemeral Cinthia interlude that doesn't really add up too much and then the Silk Road with T grizzly I can at least say that this track features one of the better Teague Risley features I've ever heard I I don't really care for much of what Johnny and highly suspect in general have done on this track but it hey grizzly kills it the song taking off is also pretty difficult to digest it's maybe a very weak attempt at an industrial rock song with what sounds like these kind of thin crunchy sampled guitars it's a little Nine Inch Nails it's still a little more Queens of the Stone Age some of the vocal harmonies feel vaguely Alice in Chains and for the most part the song is not memorable the lyrics are trash the singing and production are mediocre is hell really the only thing that is maintaining my interest in this album past this point is just to see what gets ripped off next and how bad the ripoff is I mean the following track these days features these chunky heavy alt-rock guitars that are very Weezer esque I would say even some of the singing and writing is pretty Rivers Cuomo inspired to the final song not the outro but the song Snow White on the record is one of the weirdest combinations of ideas as there are elements that feel a little Foo Fighters inspired especially the vocals there are elements especially the the modern psych guitars on the track that are a little Lenny Kravitz inspired I would say there are more Red Hot Chili Peppers vibes coming off of this track too there's just not really a moment on this record truly and honestly where I feel like I am listening to highly suspect deliver a sound that is distinct undeniably them everything is like a deja vu moment from something else but done much much worse the last track Nairobi is pretty much a non-sequitur another moment that feels like music production is my passion and geez what what a sorry reflection of the state of rock music if this is even a rock album I guess there are quite a few elements of rock music to it yeah this this was not gratifying this was a thankless in the worst way this highly suspect album was not good 
3mE4p3Ctlek,ah hi everyone droned any bone tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the New Sun record pyro class this is a new record from the pioneering drone metal duo known as Sun a musical project that has been a defining force in the world of drone doom just drone music in general name something new and uncompromising ly heavy and I'd argue Sun has had some degree of impact on it the duo had an unquestionably amazing run in the 2000s things have more or less settled down since then but not completely with sun dropping a bunch of collaborative releases short form records like canon that weren't entirely made of new material it wasn't until this year that the band actually dropped a brand new project of brand new material with life metal this record also saw production from music legend Steve Albini and featured one of the richest heaviest and thickest sounds of any Sun record so far aesthetically and compositionally though nothing entirely new for Sun though I understand the option for simplicity on this one given just how great the recording was so life metal drops it's pretty good sounds great and shortly after the release of this record Sun announced another album around the corner pyro class basically more tracks taped in the same sessions but they're all stemming off of these ritualistically performed modal drones that the duo and their collaborators would engage in before and after recording sessions now given these are just timed improv essentially in a way extras one would go into this thing thinking that hey maybe it's not going to be that great maybe it's not going to be that substantive maybe there's not really much of interest here it's just extras but this record is actually really solid I will say that I enjoyed elements of this thing more than I did life metal the biggest issue I have with PI class truly and honestly is that it's kind of short at 44 minutes it's a fraction of life metals run time it's a fraction of the run time of many classic Sun Records but it still manages to be pretty engaging given the limitations of these improvisation 's and maybe their urgency as a result of that I think all the pieces on this record are a lot more dynamic and active than many of the endless soundscapes featured on life metal now of course these observations are really all within the context of Suns discography of course your average listener who's never heard of son before and has no idea what they do most of their stuff probably sounds the same and one track doesn't sound all that much more detail than another but as someone who's been listening to and enjoying and seeing son live for a long time I'm really digging this collection of tracks I'm loving the intro cut frost sea with its B steel guitar tone and harsh swells of distortion it is way more abrasive than most moments from life metal also in the mix what sounds like this otherworldly wind blowing up from hell and taking up a pretty large amount of space and the volume and textures on this track are very intense and just very huge they're moments on this song that sound like the entire world is just collapsing in on itself it's actually pretty incredible the material here was spur of the moment the drone reaches a point where it begins to resolve beautifully begins to get brighter opens up more space is in there the guitars start shifting chords pretty quickly much more quickly than one would expect in a Sun song and I love it quite a bit I'm just on the edge of my seat waiting for how these chords and and tones are going to resolve next on the track kingdoms following this the intro isn't that much different than I think your average son song or performance but in the thick of all these drones this Distortion these guitars it sounds like there are maybe some major scale melodies playing or just very righteous intervals fighting through this hellish haze it brings a bit of brightness to suns typically dark sound the following track which I hope I'm pronouncing correctly is it amplified ease either way it sounds like the Greek god of amplification the really does live up to its title with its gurgling skittering drones it's the first son song I've heard that I would dare call kind of glitchy there's a lot of subtle submerged noises hanging in the mix to that feel like they are obscured behind a wall of hideous mud either way they really pepper the main drone of the track with a lot of texture this track also hits a point where the tones that you're getting laced into the drone feel kind of serene there is a slow cycling rhythmic almost hypnotic quality to some of the secret sounds hidden in this drone that I like a lot and then there's the closer ascension whose drone is very odd it's like I'm listening to a bunch of tones individual tones lining up just coalescing and ringing in unison in a way where they feel like they are alien they're not of this world easily one of the boldest sounds on the entire record and pretty gratifying as an improvisation throughout overall for a Sun record I found pyro class to be pretty fast enjoyable direct not as major or as experimental as key records like monoliths and dimensions or the collaboration with Boris or black one but for me this one was anything but underwhelming a pretty interesting concept that yielded a lot of very engaging results feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the
