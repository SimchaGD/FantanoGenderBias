hMC-U5W5a40,hey you a fee Anthony Fantana here you know who it is we're gonna be listening to a new episode of the needle drop podcast so that's we're gonna do thank you for watching just letting you guys know that before the podcast plays a little preface here you can support this podcast by hitting up our support page like down there in the description box a small monthly fee up to date episodes of the podcast sent straight to your email inbox cool and if you want to hear older episodes we have backlogged episodes on iTunes link to subscribe to our iTunes feed down there in the description too you can also hit up art Amazon Associates like anything you buy on Amazon if you live in the US will you kick back from that that helps support the podcast as well and I think that's all I got to say we have Spencer Hazzard from full of hell on this episode we're going to be talking about the versatile collaboration that they did the body collaboration they have coming up music coming up in the future extreme music in general and there's also a weird persistent static noise that occurs periodically throughout not periodically pretty consistently at some points through the podcast it's not too loud I think the spirit of merged that was in the room as you were doing the interview like his spirit was in the room bring in some noise so and whatever this sound was I have not been able to recreate it since this podcast so it really was a special moment you know hopefully it doesn't distract too much from what we're talking about it doesn't sound like it owes to me but you know I'm sure you let me know in the comments if it is for you and if it is I apologize you guys are the best check out full of hell look forward to the new body collaborated here we go hey everyone anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest news occurred and you are listening to the latest episode of the needle drop podcast where we talked to content creators musicians artists of various shapes sizes and shades and in this episode we have the one and only Spencer hazard of the band full of hell one of the new most notoriously noisy and abrasive bands right now on the planet how are you doing dude oh pretty good alright let's let's talk about the last full-length album that you guys had a come out a while ago that I talked about a little bit on the channel I'm sure some of my listeners here are familiar with it it was a collaborative album with a Japanese noise artist and producer of MERS Bao and from my understanding that whole connection kind of came as a result of a t-shirt you guys had made or was it something else it was actually the t-shirt was later on like the collaboration had been talked about for a while but we like we emailed Masami just like make sure being like hey man we're gonna like we really want to use this image and he was like as long as you send me a couple I'm cool with it and then uh when we firstly first actually met him in person in Tokyo his wife was wearing the t-shirt to the show that's funny yeah but um we got connected with him because we are playing a show in Brooklyn in this random Hungarian guy came up to our drummer or our bass player at the time actually and was just like hey man like awesome set blah blah blah and he was just like yeah yeah I like numers but I play live with him sometimes and we're just like oh yeah cool all right man like we didn't think anything of it and uh he emailed us later he's like hey man like I showed Masami your guy's stuff and he really wants to like work with you guys so like that's how that whole thing came about and I mean your music is very blatantly influenced by grindcore Punk power violence metal as well just a lot of extreme rock in general which I mean there's there's been no shortage of for a long time I mean what is it if described it to you you know sort of made him gravitate toward you guys through this you know acquaintance that you had met out of the blue I'm like not really sure cuz apparently he like keeps up on new music like surprisingly like balázs is the name of his live drummer and uh he said that like one of his favorite current bands is Bring Me The Horizon like masami's it really like there he's like he knows about everything that's going on like anything new old he's like a fan of it hmm so like I don't know like it's we're lucky to be able to work with him I mean it's like it's an honor like I don't see why we're special compared to like another like Grindr current-day power violence noisy hardcore band but I mean I I'm not complaining like it's awesome it's just addressing that that's a pretty funny presumption that I think just about any fan of alternative music would probably make about him that he's a he's probably not listening to bring me the horizon that he's probably just holed up listening to noise all day or just I don't know listening to running refrigerators and then using that as inspiration or something I mean obviously in an exaggeration but but to just think that he's listening to bring me the horizon I think a lot of people would find a pretty funny yeah um the last time we played with him as well he was wearing a Gore guts t-shirt and we were just like oh man that's cool like cuz we're all fans of gore guts but then he like turned around we saw the back dates in it it was like dates were like a small East Coast tour like Wilmington Delaware was one of the dates and like we don't live too far from there we're just like that's so random that he would have a t-shirt from like that tour of all tours talking about you know more about the creative process between you two guys it's it's kind of interesting to to have heard you to collaborate because even though you both make abrasive music at least to my ears and you know correct me if I'm wrong it feels like it comes from a different place philosophically or emotionally you know when I listen to full of hell it very much sounds like the music though abrasive it's coming from an aggressive place is coming from an animalistic place whereas Murs bow it's almost like more of a place of lack of emotion or maybe nihilism or something yeah I think that as well like um but I mean he doesn't really talk either so it's hard to tell where his like influences or what emotion is affecting what music at the time because I mean you can tell he is emotionally invested in some of his music because a lot of it is based on like his him being a vegan like he has whole series of music like dedicated to like the trials and tribulations of like factory farming or like the issues with killing dolphins in Japan like he has whole albums dedicated to that so it does come from a place that like affects and emotionally I think but like then again I can't speak for him and when he sort of came to collaborate with you guys on the songs was the writing process I guess what was he looped in on the writing process from beginning to end or did you sort of have him add on to ideas that the band had already kind of preconceived the way he did it was we basically he said we had free rein to do what we want so we basically wrote an LP then he sent us to ours just one whole track two hours long of just different noises he was doing and it was just basically like do what you want with this and add it to your music core is like I know some people like it's been a complaint in like I like looking back I wish he what did have more like involvement in like the first half of the LP like he isn't on almost every song it's just like the way it's mixed it blends in a little too much with our style but with the second the second LP as well like we just like wanted to take more of what he was doing and like have him be in the forefront what about the sister faun yes he that followed the record yes yeah well I mean at that point it's kind of like you're sampling him are using him as an instrument which I mean if he is if he's doing that compliantly you know that's I mean that's part of the creative process yeah exactly um all right so so moving forward you guys had this new record coming down the pipe it's another collaboration but it's with a group who also makes a grab race of music but it very much comes from a place that is obviously aggressive obviously primal much in the same way that that your music is but a little bit more on kind of the freakish end of the spectrum the band the body yeah so give us a bit of a heads up as to and.and I've already showed many people who are listening to the the show the song that uh had been released the little death track which was super intense super hellish is that you know kind of setting precedent for the rest of the record or their more surprises in store for this record you know give us a bit of a heads up in terms of what we can kind of expect out of this thing there's a lot more surprises there's a Leonard Cohen cover on that album really yes Oh boom there's like some straight-up just harsh noise tracks there's like a noise grind track where chip from the body's doing vocals wow it's just like crazy free range like blast beats there's more of the stuff where they do whether it's like sampling the vocals like uh we have a track where it's like very beat driven but he samples Chrissie who has collaborated on multiple body albums like her vocals make up the whole melody of the song there's a lot of like we wanted to take it to like more God flesh swans influence both in the bot like leave from the body was like I just don't want it to be a ripoff like industrial metal records so like sure it's all over the place but it flows mm-hmm oh I mean that's that's a that's pretty interesting of okay so you're talking about you know this discussion as to where the album should move stylistically was was it a bit of an issue kind of reach of consensus or see eye-to-eye on a lot of decisions you know sort of bringing another collaborator in because you're talking about merge bow you know essentially handing over these sounds and then saying Dewey you will you know but it seems like this creative process you know the band was more directly involved in every step of the way yeah like we had no ideas we just like we had done a month-long tour together and at the end of the month-long tour we're just like alright let's go into the studio for a week no ideas or nothing the first day it was kind of stressful because I was bringing like some riff ideas to the table and just every single idea was getting shot down so like I was just like well what am I gonna do like this album but then like as the day's progressed it just like flowed more and more and became easier and easier to just like get everything done hmm and specifically are there a lot of vocal surprises on the album or you know sort of where do the vocal contributions lie from each group because the body's vocals do tend to run super freakish and and they then they were definitely down that little death track I think they're equal like in a sense like it's not one vocalist overpowering the other and like like I said there's like some clean vocals like sampled on there as well and and talking about a that cover let's go back to that for just a second how exactly do you take a Leonard Cohen song and kind of translate it into such a I guess an extreme sound you know unless you guys kind of tamper that down a little bit for your for your version I mean how do you sort of make sure that while translating it into something that your music and the body's music that can be so aggressive so abstract sort of maintain the original spirit of the track we basically like it's a very like close cover like it's like leans close to like the original but it is taken from like the body's perspective I'm pretty sure I'm not I think it was our singers idea Dylan he like has always wanted to cover Leonard Cohen in her band and I think he took that opportunity for like such an extreme experimental avant album to be like re let's do this but I would say like think of like how Sun covered for Whom the Bell Tolls sure we think of Sun covering Leonard Cohen it's just like very stripped down just vocals and guitar in some like electronics behind it so it's just like super blown out guitars still playing what Leonard Cohen's playing just like drop down like ten steps yeah okay all right so I mean the the upcoming record the the track sounds great what you're telling me sounds really interesting I'm sure there's a lot of people listening that are pretty excited to hear it so let's move on to talk about just extreme music now in general you know if you don't mind okay extreme rock extreme Noise music for years it sort of had this reputation we're just kind of pushing the envelope and you know for you guys is is that sort of a conscious effort that you continue to do or is it kind of more about just kind of keeping the the sound and keeping this idea alive just out of kind of just a passion for it I think it's kind of a passion and just like the more we play and the more we keep touring in like dealing with like people and just like touring experiences and just like seeing how different like trends are and stuff it like makes us want to go more and more extreme get angrier and angrier like I know that sounds cliche but like it's the truth every time we like write or record it's not like oh we need to like top this like we need to make it more extreme it's just like it happens kind of thing hmm is that because the where you previously were isn't giving you the thrill that it did just uh not too long ago so do you need to push it even further uh yeah basically like I mean like into any time we like write a record like as soon as we're done with it like I end up hating the songs that we wrote I'm just like it could have been more extreme it could have been better or like you know like just like I know probably like every musician goes through that just like this differently and it like pushes me to be like all right like you know and so this extremity that you guys see put yourselves you know pushing yourselves into you know does this come from the the sorts of places that we typically expect them to in genres like metalcore and power violence and and grindcore or are you guys experimenting a little more with you were just saying that you're experimenting with some electronics on this record you know do you see yourselves uh sort of bringing sounds for more alternative places you know kind of outside of the the general rock instrumentation world to sort of continue to fill your sound out and just make it more abrasive yeah I think so cuz even in like live settings like we've started using more like synth instruments and keyboards and like more samples and stuff I think that's gonna have more place in recordings but like I have gotten more into guitar oriented music just like you know have more technical death metal type stuff like has sparked my interest more so I want to take influences from that because before it was just like you know typical like just power violins Brian stuff like power chords but now that I'm just like I want to actually have the guitar not be so much of a background instrument compared to like the rest of her records because any time we would write a record I would before I would write the guitar parts I would think about like other instrumentation or how the drums are going to sound in the guitar was more of like a back thought to me but now I'm like while we write new stuff I think of like the the guitar parts before I think of anything else mmm and so you're talking about adding more synthetic elements into the music you know how the in your mind is it is it important to make sure that you know the sense that you're finding the electronic elements that you're finding that they kind of maintain a level of grime to them because the drums the vocals the guitars especially they do kind of have a very abrasive buzz kind of feeling you know how do you sort of make sure that those synthetic elements are sort of as ugly in a way I don't think it's like I think noise has to be ugly but like when it comes to like keyboards and stuff I don't think it has to necessarily be ugly because even like look at a band like the classic like death metal band knocked Earnest like they had traditional keyboard parts but it was still like crazy death metal underneath of it but he wasn't playing like super blown out he was playing like pretty synth like for the time like keyboard parts like he was using what was available and just using those sounds not really manipulating it and it gave the music like a whole different like Spacey atmosphere like I think that could like be cool in our music or like I said you know like it could be blown out and you know helped our music but yeah I would like to experiment and you know just have any type of synth keyboard sound I create like kind of a contrast you know something a lot accepting harmonious exactly yeah and like to like just give it like a whole different vibe to it whereas like the guitars could be grinding and drums be blasting and and just like gives it a whole like different like dimensional feel to the entire song hmm earlier when you were talking about some some inspirations that might have been going into this upcoming record with the body I mean it's interesting that you bring up swans I mean not too long ago I found in 83 pressing of filth and I picked it up on vinyl and it's it's just so funny how something hmm so olds just sounds so hellish and extreme and freaky today and I don't know it's it's a I think it seems almost to me like the antithesis or sort of against the ethos of some of this music to start looking backwards because obviously we're noisier today we're more aggressive today but you know there's still something about that record that I think there are probably albums today that are kind of missing that try to take an aggressive approach that exactly like look at like albums like that had nothing to look back on it was made out like pure like artistic endeavor like they created these ugly recordings and stuff in like where's like a band like that could come out today can look look back and say like oh like I can listen to this and this and this is my influences we're an album coming out in the 70s or 80s that's completely disgusting it's just you know made from the heart like nothing was influencing it except for like their Mutis are musical like endeavor or whatever you know that's a that's a really great point you know and I think something that your average rock musician today whether they know it or not probably struggles with at least a little bit you know I mean while rock music is is is great it's past it's very it's very dense and it's very rich past you know almost kind of haunts everybody who picks up a guitar today yeah and you know it's it's kind of like you you want to have those authentic you know sort of artistic expressions that seemingly come out of nowhere but simultaneously somebody's going to compare you or something especially considering on the internet they have access to everything and you know with everybody having just every commercially recorded song in history at their fingertips it's almost like musicians can kind of overload themselves on stuff you know yeah and I mean like I think that needs to be a goal for like modern-day bands I mean it's one of our goals like of course we we're in is on her sleeve but like we also want to be able to create something that people can look back on and be like you know like it stands the test of time kind of thing like we don't want people to be like oh this was like oh you know flash in the pan like heat at the moment like tight fan like we want to like do something where it's just like like you know like I said stand the test of time like actually like because I mean there's a ton of bands like that like one or two out of a genre will stick out and then the rest unless someone there's like a complete like music nerd like or is like completely infatuated with the genre will never find out about hmm well that's that's another thing to to sort of ask about I mean even though the music industry and sort of the art of music and creating music is very different today in comparison with the process and music culture in the 80s you know that there are some things that have certainly carried over in today I mean with pop music for example pop music was on a pedestal it was very popular in the 80s as well as any other decade and it's very popular today you know it's in the limelight their shine on it there's really no difference between then and today in that respect but with extreme music the community decades ago used to be so insular it was so shadow it was so you know under the radar and now with the internet it kind of seems like anybody can just kind of casually access it just as easily as they sort of access anything else you know is the fact that the Internet has kind of removed the shadows away from this community in a sense affected the music at all are sort of taken away a sort of mystery that it might have needed to kind of maintain an appeal I mean I don't think necessarily because there are still some like I mean look at it like a label like youth attack like just has no no like they have a website but none of the bands have any internet presence at all and like half the bands release their albums on cassettes or eight tracks so like you know it's still like still people are creating music that like you have to dig for kind of thing is just not presented to you just because like through YouTube like some bands like like I said you gotta actually like dig for it or know somebody like and to be able to listen to it like there's plenty of bands like I've seen live YouTube videos for but I cannot find the demos or listen to any of their like studio recordings because they'll make like a demo of 20 and be sold out and you'll never hear from it ever again you know I hear more and more of that stuff going on like it seems like there's some artists and some labels out there that just through word of mouth I find out about because in one way or another they've kind of said fuck this Internet shit which I mean in one sense I think the Internet is great you know it allows people like me and people like you to do what we're doing but simultaneously it has its downsides too and I feel like the further we go into this decade we're sort of finding those ways out you know the ways the internet isn't exactly fair to musicians and the creative process and I could foresee maybe a you know sort of musicians and and music fans as well who are really looking for something authentic and looking for somebody who's doing something abstract and interesting searching for that offline eventually because what's going online might turn out to be so homogenized five years from now and I think too with stuff like like you hear a lot of problems with like Record Store Day like people are actually going to have to search for like truly unique underground music because even the record stores are becoming oversaturated again with like just you know stereotypical like run-of-the-mill like pop like getting pressed a million times like we've even had to deal with it like our records being like pushed back and pushed back push back because all the major like vinyl pressing plants after do with like the overcrowding of all the major market labels just like releasing stuff like reissuing unnecessary crap or just like repressing stuff that has been like repress already a million times so like to find something authentic now I think you actually have to like go to like a small record store or actually go figure out where these bands are playing live to be able to pick out their music and stuff yeah that's kind of the the downside of the popularity of vinyl right now the downside of vinyls come back you know it doesn't seem like with records becoming popular again that more record pressing plants have opened or something you know so as a result a lot of artists that I know and I talk with because I review their music and I'm sort of on a person-to-person basis with them you know tell me that I have to delay my record again my self-released record again because you know with a lot of these pressing plants the artists that are signing the labels or the artists that you know they have they sell more copies than me or they have a bigger rapport with you know sort of take priority and they've already taken half my money and I just have to wait for them to finish the pressing and then I get in the other half yeah and then - by the time like and I mean stuff like records leaking xin evitable in inside mean like I don't care like we will put our records for free online after like a certain amount once anyway but like as you're sitting there waiting for the record to come out it's like more than likely that your musics going to going to get released anyway so like it's like I feel like having a record out is like something to show for your art and like that's a pride moment kind of thing but then like it it kind of does like hurt your pride when you know you like or just like oh well I have to sit on this record but everybody's already heard it anyway you know what I mean like you can't like instead of like giving someone a physical copy like they've already had it so it's like it's taken the moment away kind of yeah absolutely I mean that's that's very much something that and I don't know how you know old you are but that's something how I that that I grew up with and I'm sure that at some point when you were younger you grew up with - you know the the the whole ritual of you know going out to buy a record that you haven't heard before and then coming back to listen to it for the first time yeah all right so so moving into the future you know could we foresee you know full of hell sort of taking any alternative approaches to releasing their music disseminating their music or you know will you just kind of stay the course that you're at now because it seems like the band has reached a certain level where you know at least continuing down this road is is feasible for now I think well probably like stick to it I mean we'll do like like when it comes to releasing music well like release cassettes or something once in a while just for fun but like we're just yeah just gonna keep like releasing you know records and CDs like as long as we can as long as people have interests and just gonna keep writing as much as we can okay and after this collaborative record that you guys have coming out with the body are you guys going to be doing a lot of live dates with them some solo dates we actually have a European tour coming up with them mmm it's like a month-long European tour and then we're taking we have a bunch of like one-off stuff just us in the summertime and then come in the summer early fall we're gonna do a collaborative tour okay and and after that whole process are you guys gonna get back to you know just kind of writing as the core band yourselves yes we already it's crazy because I mean we just released a 7-inch that we recorded after the body collab like we recorded the body collab in the summer and then we recorded a new 7-inch like a couple months later and that's doubt already and then we have a split coming out but I can't like announce anything with that yet and then we're currently writing a new LP as well where can people get a hold of that 7-inch if it's not sold out we can put a link down in the description um you can get it from our band camp which i think is just full of held band camp calm okay and bad teeth recordings is the record label that put it out okay well we'll make sure to link to that and you know we'll link over to that song that you guys had out with the body and your last record your last collaborative record with MERS bow and I think we're gonna leave it there I want to thank Spencer hazard for coming on the show talking about his band full of hell the music that he has coming down the pipe and just extreme music in general cool thanks man thanks for having me no thank you 
oZCWposs7do,hey everyone Anthony Phan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Lucinda Williams record ghosts of highway 20 all country outlaw and Americana songstress Lucinda Williams is back with a new record although she's never really been missing she's actually been quite active consistently releasing albums since her debut LP in 1979 and you could pretty much jump to any point in Lucinda's career and see her sticking their stylistic guns delivering country in blues and Heartland rock with stories about love and travel and American culture and even though throughout her career Linda has stuck to her comfort zone change is sort of inevitable you're going to change in some way eventually and thanks to sort of wearing her style wearing her sound so proudly and so consistently these days she sounds like just a road worn leather jacket and I totally mean that in a good way I mean that in the best way possible it's like this unique piece of art this unique object that only looks and sounds the way it does due to its use due to its experience and you can really hear Lucinda's progress from record to record from the very uppity and very energetic happy woman blues record she dropped in the 80s to one of her biggest records yet in 1998 car wheels on a gravel road where she is sounding much slower much more downtrodden she had a kind of bite on this record that a lot of very forlorn female singer-songwriters did in the 90s and then in 2008 with her record little honey her voice was so much more worn on this LP the production was punchier felt like she was kind of playing it fast and loose like she really had nothing to lose and in 2016 Lucinda Williams sounds like she has nobody to answer to you know she's doing things on her own terms and her voice comes off as dusty as an old country road sometimes for good sometimes for bad for one it certainly gives the record character Lucinda Williams sounds like she's been doing a lot of living for the past three decades her voice creaks on this thing like in old wooden floor and she's not exactly in a rush to sing a lot of these songs there's some tracks here that are in indulgent tracks like Louisiana story that really go nowhere fast and with some songs here being six seven nine twelve minutes people who are more used to a direct Lucinda Williams might be a little impatient with this thing but listening and closely to Lucinda's lyrics can make these long songs worth it as the imagery she brings up is really gritty II but the singing on this thing occasionally can get really frustrating for whatever reason more than any other Williams record in the past the vocals are muttered their slurred it's almost like Lucinda recorded much of this album in the midst of hangover or some kind of transformation where she was becoming a zombie and it's super distracting even after multiple listens to this album I just couldn't get past it especially on tracks like if there's a heaven where the vocals just seem so wavy and out of control of themselves I'm just not seeing the appeal but if you do listen carefully and sort of listen past these vocals you can hear some really beautiful and sometimes jazzy guitar embellishments from Bill Frisell who appears on this record he's great throughout the LP singing like this was obviously a conscious effort for Lucinda and there are some moments where I think her vocals do go over well because the vocals on this LP occasionally deliver this incredible heap of sorrow they're super intense really makes this record live up to the title ghosts of highway 20 as we've seen - sings like literally a specter from another dimension that's haunting this record but tunes that go over well are tracks like death cane which has one of the most bone-chilling choruses on the entire record it's an incredibly dark track it's sort of like the final nail in your coffin and the song doors of heaven has a bit of a blues rock vibe to it some religious overtones and lyrics basically deal in Lucinda trying to live straight trying to stay on you know the good path and the song place in my heart is a cute little love ballad I it's actually one of the most heartwarming moments on the entire record to the point where I couldn't help but just go on oh the middle point of the record is a little indulgent it kind of loses me but then Lucinda comes back with a few more direct cuts where the vocals are decent tracks like bitter memory where the frustration in Lucinda's voice makes her pretty animated on this track definitely a standout and can't close the door on love is definitely a highlight as well if not only for the burning guitar solos all over this track that sound fantastic the closer again for me is a super indulgent moment on the record I'm just not enjoying the spots where Lucinda and her band just take a more long-winded approach but without a doubt they're gonna be country fans Lucinda Williams fans who are gonna love hearing her where her emotions her experience and her age on her sleeve as she goes even deeper into her career with no signs of stopping this record wasn't too consistent for me the vocals didn't do it for me a lot of the time some of the songs were just not really that coherent due to occasionally the repetition or just the aimlessness of these tracks or the vocal performances but the production was good there were some great tunes on here and at least the instrumental performances were pretty great I really did love bills addition on guitar on this thing I'm feeling a decent strong six on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it your best you the best what should I review next hit that like if you like and that's it Lucinda Williams goes to highway 20 forever 
9wxdMu-73hw,my dental game is sick so any trash you're talking just just throw right in the garbage because these teeth they're always shine and baby they're always shining hey everyone it's time for a review of the new bones mixtape useless bones is a prolific Cali rapper who I didn't anticipate I would be reviewing again anytime soon I'm not sure if he's too happy about my last review of his music nor are his fans but that's neither here nor there he has quite a few mixtapes under his belt at this point over two dozen a great deal of which have a very distinct sound it's eerie devilish rap music that borrows a lot of flows from bone thugs-n-harmony three 6 mafia bones voice can be a little monotone the instrumentals cloudy murky nocturnal trap flavored very dreary melodies occasionally some guitars work their way into the mix occasionally some singing works its way into the mix although I had not really cared much for bones as singing in the past and one more thing is that the tracks are usually pretty brief like 1 to 2 minutes maybe three and all of these characteristics carry over onto this new project over here but there are some noticeable improvements which most likely came gradually with one project after another kind of hard to notice in between mixtapes but comparing this with what bones was doing five tapes ago the sound quality is better the production is heavier more vibrant doesn't really sound flat the vocals sound they're recorded better and bones delivery I think has a bit more diversity to it sure he's always sung but some of the screamed vocals that I know he's worked in two previous projects sound so much better here to the point where they're fierce they're hair-raising still though I wouldn't call bones marketable exactly and that's very much an intentional thing for him I'm sure but still despite that his fanbase is fairly large and rabid and even as the attention of artists like ASAP Rocky it sounds like to me much of the stuff that bones was shooting or on his earlier mixtapes he's just hitting right on target here even if it is kind of a short project at just nine tracks I do wish it was longer but still what little material here we do have is borderline disturbing and has a very real creep factor to it the opening track is a very quiet tune distant guitar lead very dreary very sad the lyrics I think kind of deal in a bit of betrayal and they're delivered with vocals that are very subdued very monotone this intro kind of puts me into a kind of a low bit of a hypnotic state and then we jump right into the song rest in peace and this song goes hard as fuck it's one of Bones best songs yet the bass on this thing is pummeling it's oppressive it's oh it's like I'm listening to death metal or something it's that mean I mean it's it's not close to death metal in style but I think it's close to death metal in that it's so morbid it's so sinister it's so frightening his flow on the verses on this track is to be expected but pretty great he sounds a little more amped than usual and then he works in these scream vocals they are throat shredding and they actually work really well in the context of this hip hop song usually such a thing especially vocals like this I could never imagine fitting into a hip hop song that wouldn't make me cringe but here with this very eerie production and this very dark demeanor it works so well on the song keep telling yourself that we have another dreary melody a pretty straightforward flow for bones and lyrically it's kind of an introspective moment for him it's like he's reflecting upon another music artist somebody who might be more famous than him or just as famous as him but doesn't seem to have the foresight or the creativity or the lasting power that he feels like he's going to have on the track glad we haven't understanding the aggression comes back harder-hitting beat throat shredding screams that trade places with these very very subdued just so understated sung vocals he's just hitting the deepest spot of his range here listening to these some vocals is kind of like a stalker creeping up on you or something but that's the thing about this tape it's not really about feeling comfortable it's sort of something that's I think trying to keep you on the edge of your seat like you might get up at any moment because you're either feeling a little unsettled or you might just sink back into your chair and relax because you're total psycho on the song tempo I wish this track was a little meteor a little longer had some more prominent vocals a stronger verse but I do like the instrumental here a lot especially with the very ear piercing shrieking tones sounds like something straight out of a horror movie which many of these melodies do it's it's kind of like I'm listening to revised John Carpenter soundtrack snippets just worked into these dark just frightening trap instrumentals that's exactly how I feel about the song right on schedule and immediately after the project takes a bit of a soft turn with the song soil if there ever was a hip-hop song that was perfect for a funeral it would be this one though I will say this track does have some of my least favorite lyrics on the entire record what do you know no we got a good but it does seem that bones was trying to paint the picture of people who seem like they're avoiding him or something like just his presence creates an awkward situation like maybe they hate him maybe they're jealous and with the song translucent this is kind of a nice change of pace because melodically this track is super heavenly oddly enough um this to me sounds like something that would have made great for a song and like a Super Nintendo RPG or something like I'm reminded of like a snow level in like a 16-bit video game or maybe just like the first snow outside it's really beautiful it's really gentle it's it's funny and interesting that bones is capable of music that is just so gut-wrenchingly dark and then he whips out a track like this which is so in a way dainty pretty and on the closing track here it seems like bones kind of has the last laugh he is reflecting on people or specifically teachers who might have told him that he shouldn't drop out he's not going to amount to anything the choices that he's making her crappy but yet he's here kind of forming his own lane making a name for himself growing his fanbase and improving the music that he's making and he's doing it all on his own terms regardless of whether or not I enjoy another bones project into the future I admire that I'm feeling a decent strong seven on the stank transition have you given this mixtape a listen it's a tape but it rides a lot like an EP I think so you know I think if you go into this thing with EP expectations and look for some good dark hip-hop music then I think you're going to find a lot to like here what did you think of this project if you heard it did you love it hated why what do you think I should review next you the best or the best the best forever 
C3MiVqatUl0,hey everyone with enugu tanto here that makes no sense that is so stupid the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new self-titled Majid Jordan LP this is the full-length self-titled commercial debut of Canadian R&B duo measure Jordan a couple of years ago the duo got what my buddy DJ academics would refer to as the Drake stimulus package and they've been signed to ovo records ever since dropped a pretty promising EP a few years ago this hype has been building up to the release of this album does it deliver uh no I don't think so this thing is mediocre from the word go I know that this moody spacious alternative R&B is really trendy right now but these guys basically regurgitate every single cliche in the book that's already out there for this very young trendy style of music you would figure that with this sound being so new that they would just I don't know accidentally do something different or refreshing with it we've heard this we've heard this we've heard this we've heard this we've heard this we've heard this and we've heard it done better the cents on this thing are very smooth super minimal kind of faint to the point where they don't even really have that much presence in the mix the percussion is occasionally dancey most of the time very sparse and kind of polite and the vocals just don't really have much personality or charisma to them they're not very seductive I don't even think they lay that much emotion onto the track and they're so distant and covered with reverb that I think they're too impersonal to really connect with emotionally or interpret as being sensual or sexy or moving I'm just kind of getting a lot of breathy crooning vocal gymnastics R&B corniness whoo if Drake wanted to be selling music like this why did he let the weekend slip through his fingers there are even moments on this thing like the song shake shake shake where the vocal sound like a dead ringer for Abel which is kind of odd because I don't remember the last ep sounding that much like the weekend I guess there are also some moments where I get some 80's pop pastiche coming out of the instrumentals like maybe a little bit of Phil Collins or Peter Gabriel which I guess is an interesting angle somewhat for an artist in this style of music but it's not like the duo does anything that interesting or revolutionary with it as a lot of the instrumentals are kind of bland boring not that intricate not that flavorful the synth patches are kind of run-of-the-mill the percussion Tambor's are very run-of-the-mill every element of this project seems like it just exists not to bring this record personality or do anything interesting but just fulfill a role in an already pre established alternative R&B blueprint we're either getting these uppity danceable tracks somewhat danceable tracks that just don't really have a good tune backing them up or these really quiet moments that the duo seems to misconstrue for being sensual and intimate when they're really just underwhelming and like on the song warm there's just not a whole lot I can kind of celebrate on this record if this were a demo I would say it sounds like a pretty decent demo but it's not it's a commercial full-length record again the production is just really plain and unambiguous track not only does it have just a sort of misplaced vocal sample but the progression if I supposed to dance to this this long is so awkward the vocals are so unimpressive that even when they're handed a decent tune like on the track love is always there the performance is so flat and so average that there's really no reason to return to the song and there's so little in terms of sound play in these bees it's like the duo didn't work at all to try to find a sound that would be distinct to this project this thing just seems super phoned in which is odd because the like they're an up-and-coming group you'd expect to duo to be hungry at this point in their career but they sound even more uninterested in making their music than I do listening to their music I don't know I mean I don't really have anything else to say other than that feeling a light too decent for on this thing transition have you given this album a listen if you love it did you hate it but would you rate it you do best you the best what should I review next and that's it you Jordan forever 
M082_esTTsc,camera equipment should not be sticky hey everyone sticky thumb tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new future project over a year evil future is an Atlanta rapper and auto-tune addict crooner and he's been having a pretty amazing year so far pretty amazing past couple of 365 days really ever since he dropped his last big commercial project dirty sprite - ever since he came out with that thing it's like he's reached God levels of popularity it's like all the pressure that he built up with these really well-received mixtapes just exploded upon impact of that record and even though I've just really hated futures past efforts even I was won over a little bit by dirty sprite - it had heard ruggy moody aesthetic to it that I liked a lot my issue though was that there just wasn't really too much to this project beyond that aesthetic beyond that very cool vibe that it had future's been seeing a lot of success with this incredibly simple straightforward obvious formula lethargic mumbly laid-back auto-tune vocals very skeletal simple trap flavored instrumentals that have moody melodies laced throughout very very repetitive song structures emphasizing either just a vocal hook or just particular word or line that he repeats every line every other line just to kind of just keep the earworm factor going in his music to keep this stuff stuck in your head even though I don't love it a lot of the time it is evocative and makes me imagine future swimming through a sea of cough syrup laced sprite and that's very much the case for this new project over here future once again is in the same creative headspace that it was on his last big commercial project he's not about to just give up this sound that he's seen so much success with even though it seems like there are so few things he can actually do with it were so few things he chooses to do with it it's like his ambitions aren't really pushing him far enough to do anything refreshing with this sound especially on his last mixtape Purple Rain where that project really sounded like a bunch of ds2 leftovers just completely unkempt uncleaned and with a lot of crappy DJ drops thrown on top and in a way evil feels like ds2 leftovers - maybe just ds2 afterthoughts but they do seem like they're more well groomed in a lot of ways I would actually say that this project is on par with ds2 quality-wise this is all the pros of ds2 carry over onto this thing but there's no chance of evil becoming as notorious as ds2 because it just kind of continues to play with this sound the futures already established at this point still though there are lots of songs here that would be the perfect soundtrack to some bad decisions being made on some good drugs I like the very eerie and nocturnal zani family future kind of taken a detour from his drug of choice to rap about again the illegal drug trade sex money yeah that's that's really his MO that's this thing there's also kind of a creepy factor on the opening track ain't no time that there are a lot of skeletal songs here that I tend to favor over the heavier hard-hitting tracks because with those songs being so loud being so in-your-face they kind of remind me of how basic and undercook the structures of these songs are just skip to any point in any number of these tracks and you'll probably hear future repeating the same flow you hear the same instrumental loop you'll hear the same melody there's really not anything in terms of progression too many of these songs after all a lot of these tracks just kind of fade out or stop suddenly when they're nearing the end of their runtime tracks like little haiti baby or in her mouth both tracks as well where future delivers some of his worst vocal performances as I said the pros of ds2 carry over onto this thing and so to the cons futures voice and his vocal performances have not improved he's still a garbage singer some of his melodies are completely crummy and what melodies on this thing he does pull through with that are decent he can't really push them beyond one little tiny redundant ditty that he recycles ad nauseam and the lyrics once again are pretty shallow and one-dimensional not really much going on there although they are worth reading into at least once if you're going to listen to this thing for a good laugh it's sort of an ugly collision of trashiness and extravagance that I find kind of funny but not so funny that it's a joke that I would return to nor do I even really think it's supposed to be a joke I kind of feel bad for anybody who reads into futures lyrics and thinks oh yeah he's so cool cool neato stuff so cool swag so cool so dope cool of course on this project - the ballads fall flat like on the song lied to me the song low life works as a ballad but only because of an appearance from the weekend one of the few moments where I've actually seeing a weekend feature and I'm like yes thank God just break up the monotony of futures voice yes and I do like a lot of the instrumentals here like on the very harmonious and layered and dramatic fly  only but I feel like all the positives that I could bring up with this record all the negatives I could bring up with this record I've already brought up with ds2 this thing is kind of like a DST rehash a ds2 sequel and once again I see the appeal especially in a handful of cuts that I think appeal to me for what reason I'm not completely sure I mean I can pick up aesthetic qualities to these tracks but they all kind of sound boring when you have to listen to them one after another in an 11 track succession I guess with futures music it's best to just be doing something else more fun than sitting down and listening to futures music it's kind of like ambient hip-hop in a way you know it's just supposed to hang in the background while you're doing something that you could be potentially arrested for it won't distract you from your legal activity it's not too loud or interruptive to the point where anybody's going to be calling anybody over like a noise ordinance or anything like that you know it's it's it's just hanging back there set in the mood I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next future evil forever 
2rXdOEULv9A,hey everyone basin ebay tan out here the internet's busiest music nerd you just can't get rid of me and it's time for a track review of the new Beyonce song formation the title Queen Bey is out of the new track she really needs no introduction at this point you know she is international pop singing sensation I mean she's performing at the Super Bowl for Christ's sake and it would seem Beyonce is full of surprises lately with her 711 single and video her last full-length album which is dropped out of nowhere had a bunch of music videos attached to it to that album itself I wasn't head over heels for it but in a lot of ways I thought it was her riskiest and most adventurous album to date and it seems like beyonce has taken a lot of risks with this new single over here to immaculately shot video we're not going to get too into that but I just will say for the record immaculately shot video the track has a banger instrumental with razor sharp high hats just rattling away throughout much of the song lots of sub-base a good groove and this very quirky plucked very textured melody that I would not have expected to be in a Beyonce song would have thought it was a little weird a little too left field for some Beyonce production and yet it turns up here and Beyonce herself I think matches the oddity of this instrumental with a bit more ferocity a bit more aggression some charisma some confidence some cockiness the track starts off super subdued with Beyonce talking about how her haters are throwing these illuminati accusations or her it's kind of hard to bring up now i don't know if the illuminati accusation thing is as popular as it used to be i don't see it as much as i used to but maybe it still is for the first few moments the track is very Spacey very dark kind of moody and then almost instantaneously it changes flavors as the instrumental coasts up and Beyonce introduces to us this short little beautiful vocal harmony the track gets some bass gets a groove and we're off lyrically Beyonce's coming off kind of mean and sort of raunchy on this track and I like it it's sort of sexy it's got a lot of sex appeal to it in my opinion in a way kind of reminds Beyonce was doing on a drunken love single but I feel like she's pushing that attitude she had there a little further she's taking out the glitz she's taken out the class and she's given us something that's just purely badass at least on her terms you could see it as Beyonce playing a role you could see it as Beyonce being true to her roots either way it seems like she's very effectively putting on this mean face this tiger face and she's very blatantly trying to reference her Southern roots and saying that her mom's from here dad's from here she's still country she keeps hot sauce in the bag probably a very expensive bag probably a very expensive designer bag that is worth as much as your house but there's hot sauce in there and there's even a Big Freedia vocal sample in this track like lodged into the middle of the song which was sort of odd unexpected but cool the first half of the tracks structurally very much mirrors the second half of the track I mean we get another chorus Beyonce's talking about the Illuminati accusations but then all of a sudden out of nowhere we're getting these sharp very nice horn flourishes in the instrumental that follow the vocals very closely I love how the instrumental does have some detail to it it's a poppy immediate song but it doesn't hand over everything right away and then one of the oddest lyrical moments on the track something that actually kind of lit Twitter on fire was this mention that when her man fucks her good she brings him to Red Lobster that that's Bay for you you know why jay-z keeps her around she gets him the Red Lobster she hooks him up with that two-for-one deal at the Red Lobster hey baby you know what I'm gonna spoil you a little bit we're gonna get some Red Lobster to be completely honest here this is the best Red Lobster jingle I've ever heard in my life so you know you do have to kind of see a bit of a divide there between okay you know she's she's down to earth she's mean she's fierce she's cocky she's confident and she's country but also like you know we know that you're like one of the biggest-selling pop stars of all time so I mean you come on still though I think Beyonce had a vision I think she had a personality that she wanted to put through in a song that she wanted to put on to record and I think she's doing that really effectively on to a track that has a lot of charisma has a lot of character is catchy and is just fun to listen to so those are essentially my thoughts on the track transition have you given this track to listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it boom are you hoping an ube record is around the corner I hope so that'd be cool that'd be nice and that's all I got to say I hope you're doing well eat some fruits and veggies make sure you're hydrated forever 
81m0BlDyRtM,yeah hey everyone - ahead tan here punching you in the face with a new track review this latest death grip song hothead death grips experimental hip hop trio don't need too much of an introduction at this point I hope I review them so many times in the past I'm probably going to put a few review links at the end of this video in the end slate click on them and don't forget to smash the like and tell your mom to watch this video and listen to some death grips the band has a new record on the way bottomless pit and in true Death Grips fashion we are essentially completely in the dark about when that album is coming out it's going to be coming out in 2016 but not exactly sure when and speaking of dark this cover over here cover is the I guess the cover art for this new single really deep man good job guys you know kind of confused about this but whatever and but in Death Grips defense this is probably what a bottomless pit looks like when you're on the inside of it ah and if there's another thing about Death Grips they know how to release a teaser track a song that has a same level of intensity and aggression they typically expect from the band but with a slightly new and different angle that makes you feel either excited or kind of weird about what you're listening to this track has in my opinion inanimate sensation levels of aggression but just with like an extra heap just a little bit extra to the point where the song and the band's performance here is just unhinged it's not complete noise it's like controlled chaos but this is one of the wildest performances I've ever heard on a death-grip song from emcee rides Big Love no no no - Zach Hill sounds like he's brought live drums back into the mix back into the picture here and he is bringing the hella era dizzying drum fills snares kick drums and cymbals that you've come to expect from him as the amazing drummer that he is and then Flatlanders ring this wall of dissonant weird overwhelming samples and then all of a sudden this roaring synthetic buzzsaw riff that reminds me a lot of the revving up vocals on inanimate sensation or any number just kind of squeaking squelching roaring tones that were on Jenny death the song at least at its beginning is freakish and really lives up to the title the track tempers down just a little bit to become slightly more coherent in this really aggressive passage of the song but we don't see an extreme change in the track until all of a sudden this kind of mid paced drum groove comes in these swirling speedy arpeggios that have a cool texture to them but the chord progression they're playing gets kind of old kind of fast and MC rides lyrics all of a sudden get more coherent they're way more readable but what he's saying just seems like a series of really insane violent abstractions though again he is kind of adding to the title here living up to the title of the track and kind of highlighting to us what exactly this song is about he proclaims on this song that he has no filter and that nobody knows his business I think making reference to the fact that he and Death Grips are kind of elusive in a way then there's a whole other series of lines that I think are either meant to just build up the danger factor of this song and Death Grips or in a way be a weird threat to the listener or whoever ride where the band might have had in mind good in regime like Ebola throws in cloud call me bro blinken although I think the most telling part of the track is when riot says act natural must start attack just there in that one line he goes from zero to sixty thousand and that's pretty much how this song is in general overall I like the track I think it's pretty challenging song and could set precedent for the album there are moments here that I find kind of abstract that remind me of like the first half of the powers that be and in there are moments that are just explosively aggressive that remind me a little bit of the second half of the powers that be or even like a little bit of government plates and yet I think there are some new things here too again Death Grips I think they just push it just enough steps ahead - I think stay ahead of the curve of their fan base and keep their sound at least fresh to my ears fresh to the extent where you know the usual kinds of drum mayhem and vocal mayhem that turn up into death-grip song aren't getting old at this point whether or not I love this record that Death Grips is going to be coming out with next it's going to be interesting to see where they move from here I think that's all I have to say about this song - I like the track it's got my mouth watering I'm not totally in love with how the band transitions from these more aggressive moments to these more subtle and kind of spaced out spots in the track I think that they could have moved from one part to the next a little better and that these parts of this song these respective parts of the song don't necessarily complement one another but in a way maybe that could be intentional to enhance just how rage-fueled one section of the track is and how another part is a little more even-tempered but that's uh that's really my only major critique of the track what did you think of this song did you love a hate of Y transition did this track tingle your pringle let me know and what does it make you think about this upcoming Death Grips record are you psyched for it and again make sure to comment with your thoughts and smash that like what should I review next Death Grips be the best video ain't a no forever 
k5c3-No41Ww,I'd say this Twitter's peak fluid yeah yeah hey everyone yummy thought anno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of this new young thug project mixtape I'm up I guess it's not slime season 3 where's that young thug is an Atlanta rapper singer very polarizing individual and he's got this new project out and I guess in a way it's a nice change of pace from his past few because it's way tighter it's way shorter it's to the point it's a trim 9 tracks in 38 minutes and personally I've been pretty indifferent toward young thug a lot of the time I mean I see potential in what he is doing he's got an incredibly recognizable voice even though he is supremely influenced by little Wayne he has an eccentric sound style delivery usually a good ear for production and he's had some good singles too but let's be honest here young thug with one so-so project after another is slowly playing himself out buggers past couple of projects have had the same instrumental vibe the same vocal delivery that with each new song grows more and more gimmicky the same mostly indiscernible lyrics it's gotten to the point where this collection of tracks is no more significant than any other collection of tracks that thugger has released as of late one of the few moments on this thing that that seems like for a moment there's a ray of light something that could potentially separate this batch of tracks from another batch of tracks the song f or fuck cancer which is a boozy badass tribute because he was recently diagnosed and came out about his cancer diagnosis but it only takes thugger a couple of lines before he's completely off the subject matter of the song and you know just going on about pussy sweet pussy aside from the ridiculous music video that was just attached to this track again there's nothing really that separates it in terms of musical appeal or lyrical appeal from many other young thug tracks and I guess the worst thing about this track is that there's not a whole lot here in terms of single power even though young thug is making such lowest-common-denominator rap music and he does seem to stumble upon a good idea here and there like on the song Hercules or on the track special the verses and the song overall are just too cluttered and stoned out of their mind to be organized into anything truly memorable exciting or hard-hitting despite my love of me goes occasionally the features on this thing are totally bland and boring funnily enough young Buddha I think had the best feature on the entire project it was just a you know perfect moment to throw a rapper named young Buddha onto a track named breadwinners and I'd also like to throw in here that at this point I think it's really important for thugger to have a project with really good features on it because some of the solo cuts on here some of the worst songs on the entire record and that's mostly because he's not really doing anything of interest vocally lyrically at least not anything we haven't heard dozens of times before on other superior tracks you know I mean as mediocre some of the features on this record are at least they kind of come through and break up the monotony of young thug's voice then there's some other cuts on here that are super low-key super boring King troupe as well as the song for my people there's just not a lot here in terms of anything interesting the one saving grace about this project is the glamorous shimmering sort of Spacey trap flavored production a lot of which is really good but it's not backing a good song so you know we have just a good piece of an equation that's not adding up with anything that significant I'm feeling a strong forward to a life I have on this thing transition have you given this project to listen did you love it did you eat it why what do you think I should review next hope you're well smash the like subscribe if you can and um it's about it Anthony Fantino young thug er forever

Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and this is the latest episode of the needle drop podcast thank you for listening and in this episode we're not talking with anybody over the phone or over Skype or live in person I've been invited to the personal studio of Connecticut rapper and producer apathy hated the Danger Room this is the Danger Room welcome to the Danger Room literally coming into the door there was signage on the glass that said the Danger Room you know I thought you just wanted to hang out when you said you were coming to the spot and then at the last minute you dropped the bomb on me that would do an interview I was like all right cool but I thought you were coming to chill this is listen music is my work now you know so it's like you got to take advantage and just kind of you know make make a moment of every but hey you know even though this is an interview it's still gonna be casual to be talkative we're hanging out yeah we're hanging out swap into vegan recipes and you've been showing me some records from all these projects you got coming up two minutes so so the last the last full-length commercial project you came out with was Connecticut casual full-length commercial project have you dropped anything since that in terms of like a mixtape I think you drop some stuff i corrupt I jump a couple things I dropped a joint called the Black Lodge which is kind of like in my bootleg series yes which is the compilation there were a lot of tracks on that yeah it was a ton of tracks I forget how many exactly we're on there but it was a lot it was like 40-something but then um I also dropped an EP which was the follow-up to Connecticut casual weekend at the key yep and then you had a collaborative release with demigods as well didn't you demigods was a while ago yeah it was yes okay yeah that was long as yes dropped two or Mia Farrow's out yeah yes you did in one year which was crazy and after we dropped the second one kids like yo like a month later you know one's the next one not even a month later like weeks later kids like you know what's the next one coming it's like yo can we breathe holy Sh can I curse on this yeah you can curse okay good Oh curse all you want it's on the Internet we're we're on the internet so it's not a big deal yeah we're not curse free so so you keep it pretty prolific over here in New London I mean it seems like this is a spot where you can just really focus on what you're doing and constantly drop something different always be working on something else and you're kind of within a rides distance to a lot of the other New York and East Coast artists that you collaborate with frequently you know what's why yeah I'm definitely in close proximity to these guys but I don't do anything like in person anymore we do everything through the mail you know like a lot of fans have this image of us getting together going through a basement studio pulling our hoods on twelve guys sitting around hanging out with each other now it's just like well you know we'll text each other and be like yo you get a chance to do that verse for me and be like oh yeah yeah this weekend I got you you know I'm saying because we're all old-ass men and we're all super busy and we're all working on so many things and technology is a lot of us that um the ability to to do it like that to do it a little bit easier it's a little more of a convenience yeah I mean I imagine that a lot of the people that you work with have sort of studio set up similar to what you have over here I mean you have a sound booth over here you've got a like little production suite in front of you in the other room you've got like kind of a small lounge I mean it's about three or four different rooms but there's soundproofing there's tons of music everywhere seems like there's a ton of equipment that I would love to just spend the day down here just playing with ya cuz you not here interrupting my creative process this is just me and Cal going and working on the next mixtape so so give me a bit of a taster and going deeper into the interview we'll play a few clips that I know you're gonna give me when this interview is over give us a bit of an idea and a taster of some of what you're gonna be dropping over the next year or so because from what you've been telling me you've got a lot recorded and you're sort of figuring out how to put it together and release it and you know how how often to uh to put it out how do you space everything out you know well one album that is probably going to be my biggest album of the year and this is probably gonna be my biggest album since Hong Kong is called the widow's son and it's just steeped in heavy esoteric sciences and metaphysics and hardcore rap and you know like tons of punchlines it's definitely my dopest album lyrically and beat wise is super hard and it's definitely what my hardcore fanbase wants and I was working on that and it was pretty much all done but then I realized there was a couple key guest appearances that I wanted to get who were taking a little bit longer than usual but they assured me that they're down so I want this album to be perfect and I want it to be the way it is so I'm putting it on hold for a minute and because I was putting it on hold I was like well damn I don't want to leave them dry for months and months and months and months so I was like you know what I'm gonna start a little IP then I started to work on the EP and as usual with the way I am I start to work on something and I OD and I have to POC work ethic so all of a sudden that became another album and so that's where this album handshakes with snakes which is coming out next came from so the next album that I'm dropping is called handshakes with snakes and that album was created to kind of tide fans over until the widow Sun dropped but the handshakes with snakes exceeded my expectations I was like damn this album is really dope I thought it was gonna be like you know a crappy free mixtape or something like that or the EP or something like that but then all of a sudden it took on a life of its own and I was like this is crazy tell me a little bit about the apathy fanbase and sort of how you interact with them and how do you keep in touch with them I mean are these fans or these listeners that you've kind of slowly like grown kind of like a snowball rolling down a hill as you've released one release after another are they mostly old heads who remember you from a lot of your 2000s output or are there new younger listeners who are kind of jumping onto the bandwagon too because a lot of the old school jazz rap and hardcore hip hop vibes that you sort of pull from that 90 stuff specifically sort of seems like it's come back around again has become irrelevant or has become relevant because a lot of those older records that you have hanging up on the wall in this room because this is very much like house of the holy yeah a lot of that stuff has now become classic and now that's given younger listeners kind of a chance to go back and recut eat every critique and recontextualize a lot of that stuff and and then see if there are different lens I feel like all three of those that you mentioned are I'm lucky enough to have as a fan base I have the older heads who got into music during the 90s boom the late 90s indie boom and who rocked with us this whole time I got a whole bunch of fans who've been there since I got a whole bunch of day Warner's and then there's been a whole bunch of younger kids and actually there's been a few things there's been our affiliation with Vinnie Paz and Jedi Mind Tricks where we've absorbed his you know his fanbase through just being family you know and doing army and his fan base is really active like they love him yeah absolutely like diehard cult status and then also I was lucky enough to be working with Mike Shinoda and styles are beyond and when they did the Fort Minor project Mike gave me a lot of love and put me you want a lot of stuff and put self-titled on a lot of stuff so we absorbed a lot of those fans and then there's the newer younger fans so it's crazy to me how I keep getting young fans and I keep meeting these kids who are like 13 14 and a bugged-out thing I don't know how prevalent it is in my fan base but a crazy thing is a lot of young kids will come up to me and be like yo my dad's a really big fan of yours or my stepdads a really big fan of yours and I'm like yo how old is he and there will be like these 36 he's which is my age you know he's these this and it just blows my mind that that that's happening so and like you said there's definitely or there's a Renaissance period going on where it's it's flashing back to the classics like Joey badass in the Pro era had a ton to do with that then you guys got guys like your old Droog who's bringing back that old feel and he just came out with a new song that was really good times square one yeah yeah that whole music video videos incredible yeah the video is gray almost suit yeah Lucas was one of my favorite rappers easily he's dope and a lot of people said you know he's got the nice thing going on but I think drew cows similar to NAS but hey man he's giving me bars that nas isn't giving me right now so I want to listen to those bars and and you are gonna have something coming out with him and so he's on the widow son he's on a song produced by Pete Rock and Pete is on the hook so it's meaning your old drew gonna Pete Rock Pete and it's crazy so I'm really looking forward to that but yeah man the fans the fans keep getting younger and they keep staying and I can't complain about that I'm super pumped and I as far as reaching out to him and talking to them you know I've had a lot of people in the industry who try to be sequestered and cut off and buffered from their fans and they try to do it to be you know cool guy status and all that but I think a lot of us a lot of us indie guys are such do-it-yourselfers we interact with our fans a lot more than average people and I always take a lot of time to answer my fans and sometimes you know you get controls because of that and it's like man fuck you whatever keep it moving but for the most part I like to discuss things with my fans my people who who are like yo your music touched my life like it got me through such a tough time you know and and I drove six hours to be at your show and all this shit those are the type of people I want to talk to and you know and people were asking questions and they want to know certain things but because I've reached out and open those gates I also realized that people ask a lot of stupid questions - then I'll be up I'll make a post on my thing and the first sentence will be I don't know when my albums are coming out yet but here's this some details on them right away question will be what are they coming out though I don't fucking know I just said that so it's funny man it's a double-edged sword when dealing with with the masses and dealing with people and talking to people it's awesome and it's rewarding and I love it and I'm also the type to wear shows I'll stay an hour after the show and talk to kids and you know I'll be engaged I'll sit there and talk to your face and and keep a conversation with you and and sign autographs and take pictures and the answer questions and all that shit you know I enjoy that yeah I mean it seems like interactions important to you but also you're not like this Internet addict you're not this social media addict you know you it seems like giving back to your fans is important to you but simultaneously you know we're talking about a totally different ballgame of music promotion from when you were originally coming up and I imagine kind of even though the technology in a sense has made creating music easier sometimes in a way it kind of makes interacting and sort of making sure that you're staying in the forefront of people's minds harder sit especially since there's so many people active out there on social media constantly shoving themselves into other people's faces and occasionally you've got to remind other people oh I'm here too you know it's exhausting I think you keeping up your social media presence is super important nowadays and that's why I've always tried to stay in the forefront of what was hot like you know I mean it didn't really count when Friendster was popping Cheerilee but once myspace started with the artist pages I got into early on that my myspace player had millions of views you know it was it was really starting to crack off but then I started paying attention to I always try to stay on with what's gonna be the next thing like for example I remember the day when evidence from dilated peoples told me was like yo you got to download this app and start getting into it it's called Instagram and I was like all right I don't know what the fuck it is and you're gonna have to tell me what the deal is but they've told me that and it just popped off you get in that I think the important thing is getting in early and there's certain things that I'm late to like I try to keep up with like the reason I got a snapchat snapchat is just it actually is more snapchat because that's that's originally how it started because because it was just a place for people to share dick pics where they could just disappear after 10 seconds snapchat and the reason I got periscope is just to keep you know I you know as funny as I originally got snapchat to like play little snippets or like music and stuff but now I just end up putting my daughter on there cuz she's hilarious you know they mean little videos of my daughter but I just try to keep up social media wise I want them to see what I'm doing and you know this is a thing that I've always tried to beat into self titles head self is my best friend and my music business partner you know he was the best man at my wedding he's my best friend and um I always try to tell him like you look you got to be more engaged then I finally convinced him to get on Instagram I mean he hasn't made a fuckin post in like months and he just it's just not him and I just had to accept it you know so I try he he does a little bit on our Facebook artist page but it's just not his deal oh okay so so obviously there's this pressure to sort of keep up with the internet promotion side of things but it seems like artistically with where you're at there's not really any sort of pressure or trends pushing you in any which direction you know it seems like this like you were saying earlier this Renaissance and this rear echinacea nuh how great a lot of those classics 90's hip hop records were has kind of allowed you to be truer to yourself and to your sound than you've ever been able to before you know there's nothing saying that you need to make a record that sounds like the new future record or something like that and we were talking earlier about sort of auto-tune and hip hop and how ridiculous it you know just the idea would be for you to not only have an opinion on that but for you to employ that sort of stuff into your records you know that's not really you that's not really your sound I've been known as the antithesis of you know like I when Kanye did the love lockdown I did the funny little diss record there I love Kanye West I love a lot of his earlier stuff but a lot of his stuff a lot of that auto-tune crap was wack to me and you know III kind of dissed that and it's just not my steez and it's it's funny when I make my opinion known on um maybe my Facebook page my facebook artist page because it's kind of like preaching to the choir cuz most of my fans feel the same way they want classic boom-bap but then you got a couple kids who really get offended in like you know try to roast me for it for dissing you know newer school swag doubts wrapped out music but yo at the end of the day it's my fucking opinion what do you care if I say you know this shit is wack that's not like I'm like waging war on it I'm just like you know like Drake I I don't I don't care for Drake and kids go crazy when I say that they're like what what do you mean it's not hip-hop you saying it's not hip-hop to me it's not motherfucker what do you want to convince me that I like fucking peanut butter if I don't like peanut butter fuck you you get your own opinion I don't care it's crazy well that's kind of another thing about younger listeners you know and and this is something that I didn't see a lot of when when I was growing up you know this was something that I felt was kind of unique to me and a few of like my closest friends but we were listening to like everything you know we were enjoying everything and and it's it's rare that we run across somebody you know the like the the common phrase that people sort of make fun of like I listen to everything except rap in country or like that you know like that kind of stuff but now it seems like everybody's into everything it seems like the Internet has allowed listeners to break down all the cultural barriers that before might have caused a little bit of stigma as the internet you know what's the main culprit right sure iPod oh sure the iPod I could never have you had such a platform where you know Metallica and Britney Spears and DMX are all in the same playlist sure you know I mean you can make tapes back in the day or something like that but the iPod is completely made it so all your mute lights Izzie yeah oh and and now with with things like Spotify like I use Spotify even more way more than my iPod now and you know Spotify pain in the ass for artists but it's convenient in it's fucking dope like I have Spotify playlists with you know Billy Joel and Christopher Cross in Yacht rock and then I got 90's hip hop and then I got metal stuff and and I got everything on those well I mean the also I think the internet like I was saying earlier I think it's kind of gotten rid of not just any kind of stigma that genres used to have but uh but also kind of stripped away some of the mysticism I mean a friend of mine who is big into hip hop comes from you know much in the same way the same kind of taste that you have he sees a website like rap genius as a powerful tool but also he talks about the idea in a video of his and I'll try to link it down there in the description box his name is d respect and he talks about how back in the day if you really wanted to know a lyric you had to rewind the tape again and again again really listen to it write it write it down think about what it meant try to contextualize and figure out in your head if there was some kind of slang in there that you didn't quite understand and now sites like rap genius could just completely demystify all of that because it just explains it in a really easy fashion and you know as important as it is for an artist like you to probably have lyrics up there because I mean it's for the fans they're gonna interact with it it gives you more presence also you know doesn't it kind of I don't know ruin the surprise a little bit I think it ruins a surprise and I think it's just I don't know it definitely gives a different feeling to everything it's kind of like those those sites that put up the samples like not everybody should have access to that man like it takes away the fun like who lets you know where the samples come from yeah yeah that sucks man like I get it but it's just and now I got kids asking me like they're entitled to it they'll just I'll post up a song and they'll be like what is this sample from and I'm like fuck you man like how fucking dare you for somebody who's older you know a younger listener might not quite understand that indicate that that's a trick of the trade yeah that's a that's a secret recipe ok so for the guys who don't know the younger listeners ok the stigma back when you know things were were newer in hip-hop when things were in them you know the mid nineties the late 90s you don't tell people what your samples are it's a bad look you don't I'm saying that's like you know somebody coming up to you being like yo how much money do you make a year it's rude you just don't ask questions like that you couldn't just walk up the premium and be like yo and say it and you could maybe be like yo Preem would you mind if you told me this maybe but you know Sam but you can't just come and be like yo preme would you sample on this he'd be like man fuck you like who are you to ask me that like that's just it's it's an etiquette thing and I think that's been lost over time and people now are like oh so what's the big deal who cares also it's it's very much about competition too you know and sort of a artistic style yeah you know going back to that very same era of music and hip-hop as well as styles of music like reggae guys who ran sound systems where people would come out hundreds and hundreds of people to party around these sounds exactly they'd wash the labels off the records because they didn't want anybody else who ran a sound system or knew somebody who ran a sound system to see those records and know what the records were so they could basically compete with them so I come from that school and that era and that that mentality in that feeling and that was cool that it was a cooler feeling back then as opposed you got to admit no matter who you are and how young you are knowing everything and demystifying everything is not always awesome and that's where the whole allegory from the forbidden fruit of knowledge comes from you know sometimes it ruins things sometimes it sucks when you know too much you know and is it's a bummer I remember back in the day how cool I remember listening to a naughty by nature album wondering how they made things sound like that and you know now that you're older when I listen to an album and I know exactly how they did everything it takes away some of the magic and you know it's like when you're young and you believe in Santa Claus there's a magic there when that gets taken away from you it's like that's a bummer you know it would be cool if that did exist and like you were saying about the lyrics I remember the first onyx album I was fanatical I mean I have like black Tim's and black clothes in a bald head and went back the fuck up came out and but some of the lyrics I had no idea what the fuck they were saying ah I track exact black pulled the sides and black pryzen and I'm like what the fuck did he just say I don't care but and it's crazy and you know I remember um like in 2009 I was out in LA and I was waiting for Ryu I was in the car waiting for Ryu to come at or like a restaurant or something and I had I had listened to Illmatic from my entire from from 94 throughout my life since then fanatically all the time okay in 2009 though I'm sitting in a driveway or something in a restaurant waiting for Raya to come out and for the first time it clicked one of those things that now I said that I never understood what he said where he said heard a few chicks scream I heard a few chicks scream arms shook couldn't look when he's talking on New York state of mind but when I was young for some reason I thought he said murder future extreme I didn't know if that like some five percenter slaying or something like that but then all of a sudden just clicked and it was so cool for me to come to that by myself you know I'm saying not reading online or anything like that I was like oh shit that's what he said so that that whole thing is cool where you know you don't rely heavily on just having it all spelled out for you mm-hmm yeah it's it's the idea of coming back to a record that every single time you listen to it you hear something new you learn something different about it so for someone like you and I know that you have these new projects coming out this year and we'll talk a little bit about those now how does someone like you in this day and age where sites like you know who's sampled are out there sites like rap genius are out there there are tons of videos out there that sort of spell out to a tee the basics of hip-hop production and sort of you know what equipment to buy and who uses what and all that and who uses what trick you know how do you sort of maintain that mysticism in this day and age I don't know I don't know that you can I mean I think that we just do our best we try to find you know samples that are rare or samples that are painfully obvious and flipping in a way like you know when I flipped it for the Martha Moxley shit sure and you know things that are painfully obvious and you freaky in it yeah everybody wants to know what you're sampling but if they realize what the sample is that they know the sample is already off the bat it's almost as if that disappoints them in a really weird way like oh you that was too obvious of a sample I mean did the song work or did the song not work it worked great people loved it people that's what I'm saying love it or well as far as Martha moxley's shit people either loved it or thought it was corny that I was sampling but most people just loved it but with the newer project that I released weekend at the Cape I had this song called Block Island sound with locksmith on it and um I sampled Fraggle Rock theme music right and I thought this was a hit I thought I knocked it out the park I was like people are gonna lose their minds when they hear this and I played it for certain people before it released and you know people around my age and people were like oh shit this Fraggle Rock and they were bugging out but then I started seeing on sites and on YouTube comments people were like yo this beats wack and then I'm like what how you gonna say it's wack but then I realize it's young kids who had never seen Fraggle Rock so they don't know what the fuck that is you know I'm saying so it's like they have no no framing you need to sample something that's nostalgic for them yeah like something newer like Power Rangers Assoc like that spongebob theme song or something yeah like so I knew where I was already fucking and getting my dick sucked but it's like some cartoon that came out when I was like 20 fucking 4 ok so so so tell me a little bit about these projects that you're gonna release what's the next album you're gonna put out you talked about it a little bit what what can people sort of expect from the sound from the record you know what are some of the first songs we're gonna hear and if you could you know give us a clip to you know we'll play one yeah yeah for sure the next matter of fact I'll give you guys I'll give you a clip for the first joint which is called an attention deficit disorder and it's just it's a faster paced joint and it's just over a dope sample and it's just me rapping kind of fast and I don't know I just I found the sample and I just freaked it and I fell in love with the record so it's not really that deep it's just kind of like some spit shit talking shit but on the album is is super dope man like I said I started to just throw it together and then it took on a life of its own and I was gonna make it super smooth and jazzy but it ended up being hard too it's got a lot of hard stuff and a lot of really dope shit Scott I got guest appearances from twister on there I got homesick jackin and be real I got one B on there I got um you know himself is I'm waiting herself to send me his fucking mercy because he's my best friend he's always takes the longest cuz he's like waiting forever yeah yeah he's like not only why wait forever but he knows see self and I put our albums out together like self goes and does the actual manufacturing of the album so he knows when my albums are done because he's the one who turns them into the manufacturing company so I'll be like yo give me that first give me that verse and he's like are you done with the album yet and I'm like no he's like well wait till your last things last second so he wastes the last second motherfucker and but I got a lot of dope kiss appearances and I got Rask as Oh see I got this on this newer dude from New Britain Aryan a marvelous who's dope I got black a stand on there I got on some local singers from around the way I got this this dude who was all over Connecticut casual Kappa Gamma who sang on there this girl Maria gratia sings on there it's dope I like to use a lot of people a lot of local heads who are talented who people may not have heard sometimes people give me shit about that that we're like yo you use more just two people from a OTP yeah man but there's a lot of fucking talented people who need to be heard too you know there's a lot of unknown people who who really should get out there you know and I mean you know you're talking about twisting and bun B being on the record I mean it seems like you've already kind of reached your big name quota yeah the record yeah twist the the twist this verse is so insane it's a song called Moses and you know I did my best to do my double time I kind of kill it a double time but at the end of the day I knew twister was gonna fucking body me on it it's not like a surprise you know I'm saying like you can't you can't be like yo I'm gonna go play ball with Michael Jordan and I wonder if he's gonna put up more points in me yeah he's gonna fucking destroy you because he's twist there's a Michael Jordan of double time shit him and Shifu you know so I knew that was gonna happen but you know it's it's an incredible song man I did all the production on this album and I really I really dig it though the joint with be real sick jacking is is like some real grimy creepy like trip down to Mexico almost like a Breaking Bad feel you know to it and it's it's really bugged out lyrically sonically are there any sort of concepts or themes that kind of pull all the song together songs together because I know I know especially recently uh putting out conceptual projects seems like it's really important to you well you know what I kind of took I'm taking a break from that Widow son is a little more Widow son is a light theme it's a very light theme with the whole dark vibe and the whole you know it's got like Masonic themes and esoteric themes and all that but as far as this handshakes with snakes now there's nothing really tying it together there's you know I try to make all my albums flow together well but um I'm not gonna return back to the concept until later on in the winter when my group project will OSI drops and that group is called perestroika and that's got the theme of that whole album is like like how whoo tang is with kung fu or shit is like cold war Russian Soviet Union feel to it mm-hmm so that's that's the whole theme of our shit that's that's an interesting concept to go into it it's hard minutes though it's a dope album it's really really incredible like when I when I first started oh and I knew we wanted to do the group together and it's it's crazy man because always like my brother now Oh came up to Connecticut chills with me he calls my daughter his little niece you know it bought her clothes when she was born and all that shit and it's funny to see certain suckers and trolls on the internet who are like oh yeah apathy got OC cuz he paid him he got that money so he's pay that's not how it is at all man always working with me because oh you know we carry on the torch for the next generation and you know I was feeling what I'm doing so him and I did this album together and at first when we started out I was like well I don't know what we should do should we give it like a real jazzy feel kind of like the Juelz album mixed with you know my first album Eastern philosophy and but then it took a different life form when when we made one song called Gorbachev and it just got crazy after that we scrapped like we didn't scrap but we took a lot we scrapped a lot of the beats took the lyrics we had and put them over newer beats and put other little samples just like how RZA did with little kungfu things i got little things from the Cold War and all that and it's it's an intriguing album it's really ill fucking album the way I'm piecing it together just so many questions I want to ask just like so many interesting things that I think you know I'm learning about your creative process as you're as you're explaining the the records to me you know with with with all this new technology and I know you've been doing a lot more production on your own projects you know recently to you sort of what I guess my question is a lot of the sounds and styles that you pull from come from an era where the technology to create this Muse was super rudimentary and now how do you feel like you know these computers these samplers these keyboards MIDI so on and so forth you know how does that allow you to sort of take that sound recreate it but also push it into something else you know your how what are you able to do with this music that the people who obviously influenced you in people who you look up to people like primo people like Pete Rock you know what are you doing with this technology that back in the day they weren't able to do because it seems like simultaneously there's so much room for you to experiment and do something different but also this music comes from a place of simplicity you know like once you add too much to the recipe you've just kind of botched it you know well I think that let me say first of all I think it was either Alchemist O'Jays own who said on Twitter I think it might have been out I'll set it um that if the bomb squad had YouTube back then it would have been unbelievable and the amount of what the bomb squad accomplished they're like fucking genius like Mozart to me what they accomplished was so dense it was unbelievable and it all just flowed together in this whole sea of chaos it was just insanity how they made everything go together and they had all these little sound bites and just this it was chaos it was just absolute chaos that made sense and it was absolutely incredible and that's what I'm always chasing like you know um when when you're I'm a perfectionist I've always been a perfectionist and I'm always chasing the dragon and what I mean by that is I'm always trying to make a perfect album and I'm always trying to live up to the expectations of making ice cubes death certificate you know ice cube and pool did that and you know making albums like that making wu-tang 36 chambers and I'm not ill Matic and only built 4 Cuban Linx and even to the point where with all this technology and with all these things that I have I try to forcefully put errors into my music to replicate that sound people don't get that they try to make shit to clean but the dopest thing about Rizzo samples is when they would be chopped off too abruptly at the end and there'd be like a little clip down or something would be blown a level will be blown and this would be fucked up but this would be fact that's like jazz man jazz is the best one it's imperfect that's what sucks about music nowadays when you listen to an old arm Led Zeppelin album and you listen to what you call it what's the song immigrant song and you hear in the beginning the volume being pumped up on something and you can hear the air in the room there's imperfection and there's there's perfection and imperfection you know saying that that's when music was the best and that's when music was the dopest and now it's like when things are so fucking clean and sold down to the microscopic level it just doesn't feel authentic anymore and there's nothing organic and nothing real about it anymore I respect somebody who's gonna record their whole album and record it the cassette first to put some air into it and give it a fuck that feel more than so somebody who's got like a pro tool set up and all this shit is like I got kids being like yo app are you gonna put your music and Apple Lossless and I'm like man fuck all that shit man like come on man I grew up listening to SP 1200 s and when you know sample rates and bits rates sounded like shit that's why a lot of the music sounded the way it is because it was just fuckin grimy and dirty that's what I came from you want that clean Apple Lossless shit go buy a fucking Celine Dion album man I don't want to hear that shit I want dirt and grime like why you want shit sound so pretty one kid asked me it was a fan and he was arguing with me about the quality of some type of music and I was like bro you can't tell if something is I could play you two joints and you would not be able to tell if it was a wave or if it was 192 whatever and these kids like flew off the handle and they're like yes I could definitely tell well guess what motherfucker I stopped sampling off vinyl years ago I sample off YouTube motherfuckers i sample off mp3 and you guys have no fucking clue because you sonically can't hear it just like as a human being you can't see certain shit without a binocular or some assistance human ear can only hear so much shit and I get it I get there is sound degradation and there shittiness but I don't I don't get it man I don't with what where these guys are coming from with one here shit so fine-tuned high def crystal-clear save that shit for a fucking Avatar movie or something oh you know what one of my favorite things to reference in regards to that is this really great segment they did on the NPR music website where they essentially put up one song after another song after another song and they allowed people to listen to streams of it where they had like a wave they had a low-quality mp3 and they had something else and people were supposed to pick the most high-quality version exactly exactly and so they calculated all the results and everybody who voted did only slightly better than random Wow so people trying to pick which one was the best only did slightly better than random you can't tell me and you really can't tell and you know but that that comes from people regurgitating things that they see stars say like they see a Neil Young go oh I don't want my album to be digital I don't I don't want my music to be digital bro let me tell you something all my shit is digital and it sounds like analog if you know how the fuck to do it you know how to do it and you know that's what it is I know how to make my shit sound high-quality and I know how to make my shit sound grimy and analog feeling at the same time well I mean I think I'm I think when people talk about sound quality they're not I I think there are some things they're confused about you know the I I think there are a slew of different things that sort of add up to the idea of sound quality some of which don't have to do with other things you know therefore one there's fidelity which you can lose on an mp3 but that doesn't necessarily mean that you're listening to something that has kind of a tape feel to it has an analogue feel to it you know you can record something to tape and have it be low fidelity you can record some of the tape and have it be high fidelity you know you can record something digitally and have it be high or low fidelity but it doesn't have that tape vibe to it you know there's a certain sound to an analog record into a tape record and to you know a tape album that I think people recognize those differences but they think their sound quality differences when it's really just you're just really kind of altering the tone of the sound you know you're bleeding the sounds together a little bit you're making it dirty or you're making a grime you're like you were saying but it doesn't necessarily mean that you're you know losing things like let's say the dynamics which if you overuse the compression you'll completely suck that out of the out of the out of the picture you know and the thing about a lot of tapes is that especially FM radio - you know FM compression you know there's some songs that sound great on FM radio because it kind of just fattens up everything and it sort of makes all that bleed together so you know you're talking about fidelity you're talking about sort of the tones of sound that you get from certain mediums you're talking about the dynamics and the body of a song due to the compression that's laid on to it possibly because of the medium that you're listening to on it or if you've put it into a digital interface you may be put so much or so little compression on to it you know a lot of the sound quality you you from one record to another especially when it comes to mp3s you can't necessarily tell because the compression is so high that it's completely sucked a lot of the fidelity out of the tracks so you know whether it's a high or low quality mp3 or even youtube you could barely even tell the difference especially now that a lot of older albums are sort of being remastered and they use these high compression of presets and they just kind of use presets and they kind of just blow them out you know and and that's not a good thing either that's not a that's that's a horrible thing - and yeah man the people you're right though people definitely do have a hard time differentiating those elements hmm okay so uh so this new music project that you have coming up anything else you sort of uh want to tell us about it or do you I know that you have like a lot of projects under your belt right now you know with so much music sort of just kind of waiting to be launched how do you plan this sort of thing out you know I mean you're not exactly a like a Drake for example where it seems like there's sort of this pressure on you to always be releasing something every few minutes you know yet you are really prolific but it seems like you're super tedious and super I guess Nicki Nevada code that how you release it yeah well I think that my initial plan was to have most of these albums out this past year but like I said with the guest appearances pushing everything back and we wanted to give them proper campaigns and proper rollouts and basically just getting the entire album done and then figuring out what we want to do as far as and you're releasing these albums independently yeah oh yeah so I mean you know how does is independent but here's the thing a lot of people hire people to do this and to do that and they have labels this is me and self that's it we'll hire a publicist sometimes not even every time but this is me itself like this is it we do all of our shit from the molecular level and that comes from the do-it-yourself generation of like I said before the late 90s boom when you see guys like you know Jedi Mind Tricks in immortal technique and slug and J zone we all know how to put out records like dudes from the past didn't because dudes from the past relied on labels with guys who were working up there we know how to hustle our own shit we know more about the biz from the molecular level so basically what I'll do is when I take these projects and I do everything man I come up with the titles with the sequencing with you know with the I mix everything I record everything I do fucking everything I pick I figure out the artwork most of the time when you see my covers I doodle like a horrible doodle and I show my artists and I bring it to life yeah I work with this unbelievably talented artist Chris Murray I work with my brother open-mike who does amazing shit for handshakes with snakes I worked with this guy named Dave Quigley's his dope artist from LA it was insane and I do these little sketches and I tell them what I want to see and I send them the crappy sketch like the kill Matic cover right there with the chick that was a hole I wish I had the original sketch that I sent to Chris Murray because it was a joke it was so bad and he got that out of it he's a fucking unbelievable genius and he pulled that out of it so everything everything we do like when I did the honky Kong campaign I looked at all the dates for that month because we knew we were ready to release in August and I said okay what number we'll stick with people said they don't forget my album's dropping I said okay well one of the Tuesdays cuz music was dropped on Tuesdays back then I said one of the Tuesdays is the 23rd the number 23 is a really big number so I made this whole campaign where I took a whole bunch of pictures of Jordan and I kept you know I would erase his name on the back of his jersey and write August and I kept beating it into kids heads and I had this whole slogan words of the 23rd so you know beat it into people's heads so we do all of that man we really try to just make it so the fans know when it's coming the fans are excited about it they hear enough and they want to support it mm-hmm okay so so you're you're essentially kind of giving us a bit of a look into what an indie kind of campaign looks like you know what what other things are you kind of taking into account when releasing your record I mean obviously you're kind of selling it yourself to you know how are you making sure that these products are getting to the people that that want them whether it be a sort of ordering is somewhere online or sort of going into a record store where I've seen I've seen your stuff in record stores too yeah we still have distribution we have long distribution we have a pretty major distributor for our digital stuff which is called the orchard and then we have we go through traffic distribution up in Boston it used to be called land speed and you know that gets us into some stores we don't do like the big stores like Best Buy because hey those guys make you pay to be in there and fuck that anyway we just our fans usually buy from us directly they'll buy bundles which is doper and they buy directly from us and self-will higher-self like has a friend who he hired to help us um fulfill our orders and you know there's some artists out there who try to do that they try to like go direct to their fans as far as selling this shit but then some of the fans are pissed they're like yo you fronted you didn't send me this we're crazy methodical about it like we always make sure nobody misses their order nobody shit gets lost nothing like that if there's any damage we you know we make sure we take care of our fans and we'll we'll do bundle packages we're now fans love doing this they want to buy album a final cassette CD and the you know a t-shirt all together and one so they they get this deal of all this stuff and that's that's a huge thing for us and we'll sell those ourselves or we'll sell to like you know sites that we had a great relationship with like underground hip hop comm since we were teenagers we've been down with them so that's that's how we basically move everything out and get it all so you know is there anything to be said for the fact that you'll drop something new run into some new listeners with that music and then all of a sudden you know they realize you're a seasoned artist with with a large back catalogue if I yes sure you're that's that's the ideal situation that you know we all share happens and they they're like oh then apathy got this and that and he's got these all these albums so that's that's a good thing to about you know iTunes and everything like that as they go and look for one album and then they see my whole discography you know it's a little harder to do with physical and you know stuff like that but the digital is always a good thing when they see all the back catalogue alright um moving on to stuff that's a little more personal now because you know even this isn't directly your music it surely influences your music I mean as recently as 8 months ago you were telling me you're you're now a dad and you know you were telling me how that's sort of impacted your personal life so much made you a better person you feel like to your core but has this sort of effect of your creative process at all yeah definitely because it's like I feel more accountable for shit I said and you know I'll be candid and he doesn't even know this but when esoteric first had his kid he changed a lot of his shit in a lot of his subject matter and you know just just saying even slicked funny punchlines and me and self never got that we're like you know why does he care if he says this punchline but like I totally get it now like 1,000% like I had a line on the the widow's son where I talk about you know um you know it was just supposed to be a slick punch line just talking shit for shock value like um son about traffic and women for sexual profit and and I took that line and I deleted it and I got rid of it cuz I was like I have a daughter now and I'm you know and that type of shit makes me furious and before when I had no point of reference to that and I had no attachment to that idea I didn't give a fuck I was like oh that's a horrible thing that happens when you see it on Dateline TV shows and I feel real bad but I didn't give a fuck I just wanted to say some slick shock value shit but now you know I deleted that I I want I want to be a better person for her and I want her to see that you know her father later on when she's older see that her father wasn't just some dickhead who said horrible shit too you know like even even things like um you know I grew up saying the word faggot which um I never said it in a homophobic light I don't have I never in my life had anything against gay people ever ever I got gay friends and family members who were gay who I love and but you know we would say faggot to other heteros to make them feel some kind of way and I went in the newer projects and I'd lead at any time that I said faggot and I don't believe in using that word anymore another thing too is that when I say that word even now in context you won't hear me say that and if I'm talking about you knows people using the n-word I don't say the n-word if it's if it's in context I'll say I don't say the word nigger I don't say faggot and and I say those words I don't say f word or f-bomb or something like that sure so so you know I I guess you're literally sort of looking at the music that you're making and you're thinking what what would this person who I care about because this is my daughter this is my son think if they heard this music I guess is sort of what's going through your head yeah for sure and you know it's also about just you know being the change that you want to see you know that that whole old-school saying and and another thing too is that like like I said you know I got this three I don't like telling people too far in advance cuz they get confused album wise but like I was telling you for the top of 2017 I started working on another album and it's a lot more personal and since I had my daughter I've been inspired so I'm talking about things in my life you know I'm talking about like I say in one of my lines something about I'm just um I'm just praying that my daughter is born headfirst you know cuz those were things when my wife was pregnant that I was thinking about you know I was praying to God that there wasn't gonna be any complications and it was stressing me out and I was losing sleep over the fact that I hope the pregnancy will smooth and you know people who are about to have a kid can relate to that and they feel that same stress so those are things that I'm gonna discuss in my music because they're heavily emotional factors that I never felt before when I was an artist you know as life changes you changes a person and things that you that that are profound to you change you know and things that are important to me now weren't the same as when I was younger it's it seems like there's a lot of interesting kind of personal life changes like this to take note with a lot of hard hip-hop artists out there because hip-hop is a genre like you were saying earlier you know you're talking about these divides between the older fans and the younger fans I mean hip-hop is sort of coming to this spot for the first time because I mean it's aging as a genre you know it's come to the point where not only is it as relevant that rez rock music used to be like during the Led Zeppelin era you know I think you know where hip hop is kind of seeing a I don't know kind of it's hair metal stage in some aspect yeah you know sure you have these like really huge artists who are just nothing about flat or just all that flash and and that sort of thing but then you kind of have the underground and the experimental stuff and the I know you've referred to it as sort of the Bohemian shit yeah as well yeah and and then sort of in that whole mess it seems like more old-school guys like yourself are kind of seeing room to grow too yeah well you know what I think as far as is you say old school too um there's something to be said for tradition that I don't I think that gets lost in hip hop because hip hop is so young but like when you see um a jazz artist who plays like the old guys used to play nobody is coming to that jazz artists and be like oh damn man you playing that saxophone like an old head like your old man that's just sound old no it's traditional you know then there's a couple people who would do that probable is back and in this blues and rock you know like and it's crazy to me to I guess that you know like a group like Wolfmother came out with their first album sure and I was like this is dope this is like old Sabbath and Led Zeppelin but then it didn't really pop off like that and it didn't create any type of Renaissance so there are other groups who similarly kind of have a throwback thing yeah like Jack White oh yeah exactly sure for sure sure Jack White is fucking some Black Keys yeah yeah yeah and my favorite group completely who I put up there as much as I love Hip Hop Vampire Weekend sure their so that wears their new album there's one out in a while yeah yeah yeah yeah the last one with fucking Diane young and all that that was dope but they're actually kind of taking their time so I'm wondering if this next one they can sort of afford to you know they've kind of got this I think this sweet spot with the indie kids that they don't need to sort of rush to put out there next thing yeah I agree with it they kind of have that and those guys made an incredible meet because they got a huge like is listening to them I'll play this shit to somebody even old and they'll be like oh wow this is like Paul Simon Peter Gabriel vibe you know sure another thing that's sort of personal to you that that has come up on the grand leveler tracks like that off of your Connecticut casual record you know tell us a little bit about what that song is about and sort of your affiliation with the the Freemasons correct well yep green leveler is not really heavy on being about anything it's kind of like braggadocious just like a stream of consciousness it's not it's not poignant and it's not topical it's kind of just like all over the fucking place like people don't understand that people think I'm trying to say something crazy nah man it's just and the ill shit is is that I'm a freemason and a lot of that has masonic themes to it but a lot of that information that i'm talking about was shit that I learned when I was 14 15 years old and I was running around with dudes who were 5% Muslims and you know Hebrew Israelites back in the day and I'm holy Tabernacle ministry guys like you know dr. Malachi York and my early Jedi Mind Tricks days that's what that shit comes from you know and I think Freemasonry is fascinating in its history but um there's no real correlation and I think no I don't think I know for a fact a lot of guys a lot of young guys have the complete wrong idea about Freemasonry and they feel like once you become a freemason you're handed over these secrets or once you reach a certain degree you're handed over these secrets and they're it's funny and hysterical but there is no fucking secrets to Freemasonry Freemason we started out and where it got that stigma is back in the day um during times of religious and spiritual persecution there was nowhere to talk about any of the ideas except for the good book in the Bible or else she'd be persecuted you know you would you would be ostracized and and vilified in your own little community and you couldn't discuss any ideas other than the God of Abraham or a Catholic God or Christian God and the out of that was born guys who wanted to talk about the Gnostics in the mystery schools and they wanted to talk about alchemy and in esoteric Studies and things like that and you know paganism and and just talk about all these things and just review the ideas and look at it and be like whom this is interesting this is fascinating this is interesting how this culture does it this is interesting how this culture does it let's take some ideas from this culture and and use this as an allegory to live your life as a better person so people take that and they they view all the online YouTube videos of of all the conspiracy theory shit and all the negative stuff and they jump out the window with it and just take it as fact which is crazy to me because they have no idea who uploads those YouTube videos they don't know who the real people are who write these books people are like yo you got to look up this book in this topic yeah but who the fuck wrote that book and who put up that video oh well this guy who does all these videos yeah but do you know anything about him or who the fuck he is you could be getting this information from him too so a lot of conspiracy theories dudes or idiots to me and not just because in a defensive way of against the Freemasonry thing is but because they don't research I was there too I read behold a pale horse I read all these things I believe these conspiracies I thought there was gonna be microchips in the wrists and shit I thought 2012 was gonna be the fucking end of the world I thought I thought 2000 was gonna be um crazy shit poppin off to and all these events come and go and nothing fucking happens and you know I believe that there are armed groups out there who are greedy corporate entities who want to profit off a certain shit and I believe 1,000% that happens but I don't think that there's groups sitting around dying to do blood rituals and and do satanic things just for the fuck of it so they can assess some type of power or gain some type of power is that's crazy to me it seems like in in this era especially around music where there's just little to no mysticism around anything that people are just kind of looking for it somewhere or just making up their own kind of mysticism because the idea of a group like the Illuminati sort of controlling everything behind the scenes in terms of what we think and the media we consume and so on and so forth it seems like that's something that people can kind of gravitate to you know well don't get me wrong I think that at the same time as I don't think it's well I know for a fact it's not just it's not freemasons or an Illuminati or anything like that but I deucey and i do believe in a certain dumbing down of the masses and I do believe that in that regards the the certain powers that be view it as easier to control people and I believe in certain consumerism in certain entertainment and stuff like that that they do view it as they want to control people and I think that most people are quote-unquote sheep like the conspiracy theorist kids love to say I think that's true I think there's something to be said for all of that but I just think that they're barking up the wrong tree and I think they get a lot of this information oh yeah there's there's nothing really conspiratorial about it I mean a lot of the time it's really all out there in the open yeah and much of it is only sort of engaged in and created for the sake of just getting another dollar you know I mean that's that's really yeah the last is the corporate greed and cutting corners and when you have these people pump these toxic chemicals into things they're not doing it like a evil James Bond villain who wants to sound like it's not like a Captain Planet plot ha ha ha poison this culture no they're doing it because they're like well shit how can we cut crosses how could how can we cut costs in with these items that we have well instead of using real good materials let's use these shitty ones and who cares what happens to the people it's just for you know lack of better words it's the apathy of these corporate companies who don't give a fuck about people or what happens to people or the planet or you know the environment they just want to have a good year money-wise and they want to make a shitload of money and they cut corners and they use cheaper things and they use cheaper chemicals or they use things that give food a longer shelf-life that aren't good for an organic entity like the human body but they don't care yeah so going back to the Freemasonry though as we were talking earlier you you know you're talking about yourself being a rapper who's also a freemason and you were saying there's a story there what exactly is that story you know to you I mean obviously it's it's an odd thing but you know once you explain it I'm sure it'll seem probably less weird I think the story there is well I was just saying that there's a story as far as the interesting conversation piece you're sure because but obviously the goal historically yeah very paranoid of you know Freemasonry or any of those groups you know and as far as me becoming a freemason I came up like most of these conspiracy theorist guys did yeah I grew up study in the shit since 1993 I was fourteen years old me and my brother open-mike and all these other dudes we had all the fucking books we were crazy we used to quote all that information and uh and so once you take that conspiracy theory and you've kind of demystified it and you've realized that there's nothing really there to it I mean a lot of people go through that process yeah what exactly caused you to take one step further and actually join well the thing is is that what ended up happening was I was in LA one time and this is when I was still on the fence about Freemasons and I met this guy Ryan and Ryan was talking to me and and I was saying something about Freemasons and almost a negative light you know like oh well you know you don't know what they're doing and he goes well do you know any Freemasons and I said no I don't know any Freemasons he goes well you do now I'm a freemason and I was like word and so him and I started to discuss it and he was talking to me and the more that I started to realize what Freemasonry is and what it does and what it's not I was blown away I was like you know this is exactly what the world needs the world needs like-minded individuals who want to do positive things and you know people have taken that out of context with me too people have said well you don't have to be a freemason to do good things and yeah you're right you don't but it's cool to maybe I want to join a group and do positive things Freemasons do a lot of things is for the community they do a lot of things with philanthropy and they help out a ton and they do really great stuff and Freemasonry is all about being a better man and making yourself a better person and helping out your fellow brothers and helping out Humanity in society okay so you're talking about philanthropy and becoming a better person what exactly is I mean obviously the philanthropy thing that that doesn't need to be explained but the idea of becoming a better person to what standard do you sort of hold yourself to sort of you know measure up and say okay you know I I haven't sort of you know met that level of goodness or that level of sort of well no for me pervert you that I'm trying to I can't stand up for other guys I know you saying for me personally it's holding myself accountable to other guys I know who have a little stronger of a moral compass you know holding myself accountable not not making jokes about fucking around with girls and doing you know whatever it's just kind of holding myself as a up as a better person and a better man than I was previously because I have these other guys who are great guys to be around it's like you know what I used to hang around non-stop hood dudes and do to her you know doing grimy or shit I was a little bit shitty er of a person through osmosis I absorbed that and I I became that and it's not even like I'm a difference between a leader and a followers just sometimes you absorb it a little bit I was always the black sheep of my friends who were shitty or as I was growing up but you know you if you start to hang around people who were a little more positive and have a different type of energy you absorb that and through Freemasonry it from me was a cool thing and Freemasonry is not for everybody I don't know I don't say that all dudes need to go off and be Freemasons that's not true at all it's just a cool thing it's a lot of fun the history is fun that's involved with it and the degree work is fun and degrees are things that are meant to propound ideas of morality and and basic the basic tenants of Freemasonry with these elaborate kind of rituals that they do and the rituals aren't creepy or evil or horrible or anything like that at the end of the day when I when I did all this stuff and I went through it I was nervous at first because I kept waiting for the ball to drop you know the shoe to drop or whatever and I was like all right any minute now they're gonna pull out a fucking goat or some blood or something like that and I'm out of here I'm fuckin out of here if that's the case I kept waiting for that moment and then all of a sudden I started seeing these beautiful degrees and these beautiful lectures that they would say and I'm like goddamn this type of lecture and this type of speech is so dope and so profound and so beautiful as far as inspiring someone and I was like man I wish more people knew how awesome this was it seems a lot like it's it seems like language speech it seems like literature is pretty influential to you on an artistic level yeah for sure I used to I mean in high school I used to run around I was known for this I used to always have a dictionary in my backpack and I would always read the dictionary as far as vocab goes and then as far as literature I was really really heavily into reading when I was younger and you know my mother was my mother would blow my mother would just blow through books like crazy and just eat books alive you know she was like one night she would go through something crazy and my father was into books my father would always recommend books to me you know like you and I were talking about Jonathan Livingston Seagull earlier in books like that I just bought some I just bought a beautiful version of Moby Dick which is a great leather-bound cover which is my favorite book of all time I'm obsessed with Moby Dick and yeah I'm gonna bring my daughter up the same way are there any songs on and we were talking about Jonathan Livingston Seagull like you were saying but are there any other tracks and we'll probably play a clip from that - are there any other tracks that you would like to bring up sort of from your forthcoming projects that are sort of directly influenced by a piece of literature like that yeah absolutely I have a song called pieces of eight which is pieces of eight or um it was a form of Spanish currency which were silver that the pirates back in the day that everyone used to get and Pieces of Eight was like a big piece of treasure that you would find and the song pieces of eight on this is kind of like an extension of the Connecticut casual song don't give up the ship so Pieces of Eight is a little more on the pirate side so it's a little more on the Treasure Island feel you know that's that's kind of what I gave it like it has a real Treasure Island swashbuckler Blackbeard you know and I have tons of books which I read about you know the Pirates the actual pirates in yeah I mean well it's it's uh here's a question so so you're talking about being a father in a way sort of that influencing you to write certain lyrics or maybe avoid saying certain things because you want to be more accountable for your music and you want to be more accountable for the things that you say you know how do you sort of balance that and the idea that you're making this music that is so heavily based on the idea and sort of the archetype of like the outlaw you know and and the sort of miscreant the grimy yeah the underwear don't give the recipe hey do that I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea my shit is not fucking sugar-coated now my music is not you know watered down it's not soft it's not it not even close not even remotely I'm still talking shit about you know bashing people's heads in and doing this and that and you know like slick ways to say you'll fuck somebody up and you know these things aren't meant to be taken literally it's just like Inspectah deck saying he'll bomb atomically he's not going to bomb atomically he's not going to whoo tang is not gonna slice with swords and cut your head off or shoot up your thing with Uzis it's just not happening just it's just slick ways to saying that you know you'll outdo somebody and it's the same thing with us and I'm not watering that down at all I'm just not gonna say horribly terrible things like trafficking women for sexual profit you know and and terrible things like that okay all right um I think we're gonna leave it here man you you were great interview thanks for giving us the music thanks for giving us some insight into what you're doing and thanks for letting me look at your fucking cool ass studio over here we have to show you some cassettes later I'm gonna go look at those cassettes over there as soon as I turn this recorder off cool nice talking to you man absolutely let's take a picture of the cassettes - I'll put it up on Instagram so check out my Instagram and I'll link to your Twitter I'll link to your Instagram your website your Facebook and you know you'll let everybody know whenever you're gonna sort of come out with your next I'll pick appreciate all right have a good one you "
2RokOnZwjWc,hi everyone bleep in a blue tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new dive record is the is our Brooklyn dream pop and post-punk duo dropping their sophomore full-length LP over here following up their very buzzed debut album ocean easily one of the most relevant records of the past five years when it comes to the particular sound and style that died have going cuz there's a lot of copycats out there we'll get into that maybe a little bit deeper into the review but personally and I don't really care for this record it's too washed out too texturally bland too neglectful of songwriting for it to really be catchy memorable engaging but there is something to be said for the way that dive sort of raced to the front of this very trendy sound in indie rock music a couple of years ago despite the fact that their sound just only differs very slightly from many of the other groups chasing after this twang guitar repetitive buried vocal too much reverb dreamy rock sound so I haven't always had the positive opinion of this style this trend within rock music within underground rock music however I think this new LP over here is kind of an improvement I still have my reservations here with this record but dive has definitely made their sound a little bit more satisfying first the versatility of this record sure there's dream and jangle pop on this thing but there's a little more post-punk influence on this as well and I think a strong krautrock vibe on some of these tracks especially the title track here which reads to me is like annoy instrumental the layers upon layers of guitars on this thing shimmer and sparkle beautifully they don't kind of bleed and blend together into this really bland unmemorable mess like they did on the last record the production is just noticeably better and every piece every layer sticks out and sort of has its own little spot in the mix even the bass is way more crunchy prominent it just pops in the mix really nicely the drums have a nice spot in the mix too it may sound like they're playing the same beat over and over and over again but a lot of the elements of each song on this record are pretty similar I think it kind of plays to the minimal hypnotic linear direction that each song is kind of moving in dive has a very obvious formula but if there's anything they do on this record I think they widen it a little bit and prove just how much variety they can squeeze out of it and if there's one more step up from their last record to this record to make note of it's the reverb lead guitar lines which were very prominent on the last album but for the most part we're really forgettable buh-buh-buh however I'm finding a lot of the guitar melodies here to be sort of captivating the lead guitars on this record might actually be one of this project saving graces because they're certainly more interesting than the vocal passages that they trade places with most of the time these guitar melodies they're small they're short they're miniature but I think they'll even impact the lead melody on the song you're not far as super catchy the squawking noisy guitars as well as the very quickly descending guitar lines on the song Valentine are really great I love these psychedelic layers upon layers of guitars on the song loose ends that was a really nice touch and the lead melody on the song under the Sun is really bright it's really feel good for once I think dive are finally creating that really intoxicating sound that I think their last album was implying so heavily so without a doubt improvements on this record in terms of the production the writing the performances but the vocals are still way too impersonal for me they're so dejected and aloof and buried so far down into the mix they might as well not even be there sometimes in fact I think when they pop in they sort of kill the momentum of these tracks because all of a sudden the great guitar lines and the fantastic guitar tones are sort of swapped out for these really mumbly forgettable the the lead vocals especially on the song bent or the track that sky ferreira is featured much of the time the vocals sound like they're just killing time which is kind of confusing upsetting I'm not saying the band needs to completely overhaul their sound but clearly they put way more effort into just upping the instrumental chops of this project I don't see why they couldn't have up the vocal chops or the vocal presence on this project I mean either improve the vocals as you have improved the instrumentals or just get rid of the vocals entirely and do the instrumental album that you very clearly want to make or place more instrumental cuts on the project I mean some of the more instrumentally driven cuts on this project are some of my favorites like on the second half of the song take your time which has this really great building wall of guitar chords that are really beautiful really intense the song Meyer is some quality My Bloody Valentine worship where I actually find the vocals a little chilling and the track healthy moon this is a decent song too and one of the few moments where the vocals actually have some presence and they carry a good tune and they actually add to the dreamy seductive quality of the track it's not just the guitars and the bass kind of carrying the brunt of the song's appeal so there are some songs in the track listing that I like there are some songs in the track listening that I find merely tolerable a few that I'm just completely tuned out of not only because the vocals are just so drab so boring but at this point on the record diet has also I think with this thing being 17 tracks exhausted they're very simple basic formula overall not a bad record from dive and I think they went to great lengths to improve a lot of the issues that I had with their last record which I just completely ignored because I didn't see anything engaging about it at all this to me sonically was way more flavorful way more melodic way more colorful but the vocals just do nothing for me whatsoever they're kind of like the the one of two conjoined twins the sort of just weak and dying off the sound play the linear grooves the repetition the hypnosis the intensity all of these things seem to be very vibrant characteristics to this record but time and time again one track after another they suffer at the hand of okay we need to do a verse chorus verse structure oh we need to have these vocals in here like is so many of these songs would probably be so much better just as jammy instrumentals feelin a light decent six on this thing transition transition have you given this album oh listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next anthony Pantano died i have and say something really nice to someone down in the comments please forever 
tKXfLbBmYlo,uh hi everyone windy blow tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new block party record hymns UK pop and rock outfit block party they've been at it for well over ten years at this point and they are marking sort of this decade of music with this latest release and I have a feeling that this new record over here is going to be sort of thrown to the dogs as it seems fans haven't really been pleased with any block party album since the release of their debut record silent alarm and I mean I sympathize with the sentiment that block party just hasn't been as good as they were since their debut I think their debut record is one of the best debut albums one of the best dance punk and indie rock records of the 2000s but every album since has been met with at least some disdain sometimes I think some unreasonable disdain the band's last full-length LP in a lot of ways I thought was a bit of a return to form and I think was way better than a lot of people gave it credit for and of course fans are slagging this latest record over here too are people who consider themselves fans or at least people who are just kind of wanting another silent alarm while I'm not in love with this LP I don't think it's that bad either the band continues to deliver danceable indie rock and pop but this time with a moody er sadder demeanor and the lyrics on this thing are super intimate super personal to the point where I feel like I'm listening not to block party the band but maybe more of a solo record by the band's frontman but with some fuller backing instrumentation than what was shown on his two solo releases thus far on top of that in the lyrics there are just overt themes of sadness and anguish redemption and religion to the point where he's mentioning conversations he's had with his pastor in the music in some respects I think this record is powerful not in a punchy danceable visceral kind of way a lot of the time it's more of an emotional subtle type of power the vocal performance is on this thing are super vulnerable kind of distressed and very raw this record has an honesty to it that I really like I like that this album sort of just lets it all hang out emotionally but I do understand that this is probably once again not the record that people interested in block parties music we're looking for some people may see this record is boring or wimpy or whiny and I could see those as legitimate criticisms I mean this thing does wear on you if you aren't looking for a kind of a emotional experience but the positive things I can say about this record is that obviously there's a concept going throughout this album in terms of its sound in terms of its lyrics it's maybe one of the most cohesive records and block parties discography and the type of music they're making on this project I don't think is without precedent the music on this thing reminds me of a lot of the sad teary eyed emotional jangle pop and New Wave music that came out of the UK in the 80s the singing sounds like it comes from a place of real emotional weakness like I'm listening to a human league record or like a Smith's record or something like that but block-party isn't specifically trying to just cover those bands to a tee I think they take this emotional vulnerability and deliver in a way the only block party can and then there's just the way that gospel music subtly influences a lot of these tracks take for example the song the love within the lead track off of this project the vocal melody on this thing sounds like it's pulled straight from an old-school gospel track but it's set against these very bright sunny keyboards that play off of this driving dance beat the keyboards are kind of warped and I like that it gives the tune a bit of a weird flavor but after a while they do get kind of annoying I I think that uh these keyboards could have been better placed but the awkwardness of the versus the slight awkwardness of the verses on this track those seem to melt away really quickly once the chorus sort of bursts in the song only he can heal me oh good who loved those background vocals on this track nice touch and the song also fuses elements of dance music and gospel just as effectively as the intro I think the first low point in this record is probably with the song the good news the booming drums and the sliding rock guitars on this track just seemed a little heavy-handed and kind of makes the song stick out like a sore thumb and the song fortress might go a little too far in the other direction where the instrumentation is so sparse that it just spotlights the vocals and the vocal performances really just it's super intimate it's super just again I feel like I'm listening to someone who is in severe emotional pain to the point where this track kind of reminds me of the mountain goats a little bit like get lonely era mountain goats which again plays to my interpretation that this feels so much more like a solo record than it does like a rock bands album they're deeper cuts in the second half here that I think could have used a little bit more oomph or some development the sort of middle-of-the-road tracks that do have that same emotional intimacy but there is like a dance beat there there's a backing beat there there's some just very tangible rhythm instrumentation but it doesn't hit that hard and it tends to stagnate after a while songs like into the earth or different drugs it's at this point in the album that we actually start hearing some pretty lackluster lyrics to like rock and roll whose got so oh just give me do so yeesh and that's another thing I could see a lot of people being turned off by the lyrics way more than I am and even me enjoying this album thinking it's decent did see a lot of lyrical potholes here the religious themes seem a little too heavy-handed sometimes and it seems like this album occasionally is a little too desperate to put its pain and its anguish onto a podium and for the listener to I don't know what standing out of it sympathize in some kind of way it doesn't really sound or feel relatable how the the sadness on this record is delivered it's not like on an eye-to-eye relatable sort of thing it's thrown up onto a stage it's placed up onto a platform as if it's like you know this this incredible moment of emotional distress to behold overall I thought this was a decent record it just could have used a little bit more punch I think there were some good Tunes here I didn't mind the religious themes and I didn't necessarily mind the idea of going in a more emotional in a sadder direction the production generally was very balanced very clean occasionally the vocals the way that they wind from one track after another did sort of get to me but ultimately this album's undoing for me was that some of the instrumentals here just fell kind of flattened were sort of lifeless they could have done a lot more to either bring the song some energy some momentum or add a little bit of drama to the very emotional vocal sitting on top of them not just playing very plainly and very unimaginative ly to a dance beat in the background while the vocals just kind of try to steal the show I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing transition transition have you given this album listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it u2 best you the best what should I review next smash that like if you like and leave a comment saying something nice the nicest thing you can think of saying forever 
ygHP__BmszQ,goddamnit so help me God is the better of the three titles so I'll be God switch so help me God sway ah hey everyone Anthony fan tanto here Internet's busiest so help me God and it's time for our monthly segment where I just go back over the reviews like a lazy idiot that I put out over the past month and tell you which ones were in particular interest worth checking out good great albums yeah I have linked all of these reviews down in the description box and they are as follows yeah make sure to check out David Bowie's final album rest in peace David Bowie black star not only some great songwriting on this thing and some interesting experiments from David Bowie but the album is literally about his death and it's quite surreal as I said in my review never has a musical artist written about death and faced it so literally in their music next after that a really great psych garage punk lo-fi record from ty Segall emotional mugger wasn't anticipating this record to blow me away but that's the thing about ty Segall you know he's always full of surprises always on to the next thing always experimenting in a slightly different way he's very prolific or difficut I don't love everything that he does but if you're an underground rock music if you're under garage rock music ty Segall seems to have something for every fan of every shade of these genres next the new pop twelve eighty album paradise a really great dark gothic industrial noise rock records super heavy some dark ambient moments on this thing too it's unsettling it's a nightmare and yeah check out then I want to give shout out to the new massive attack EP ritual spirit if you're in a downtempo trip hop definitely give this thing a listen four solid tracks on this EP and a great feature from young fathers as well as tricky and roots maneuver did a great feature on this thing as well just good tracks all over and finally I want to give a shout out to the new Anderson PAC record a funky fusion of pop hip hop neo-soul R&B it's a great collection of tracks a little long a little bloated but there are some good Tunes here and I think with a more concise release in the future and just kind of whittling things down to the best of the best the cream of the crop that he has to deliver a nurse impact could come through with a killer album the next time around I mean he seems super talented has a lot of great taste seems like he's really I want to say the word I'm looking for the word I'm looking for what is the word I'm looking for versatile because he's just all over the place on this record and it seems like he has a deep working knowledge of every single genre that he toys with on this record and I'm gonna leave it at that those are the album's I'm recommending again links to hear music from those records as well as see reviews from those records down in the description have a good one transition thanks for watching you're the best I hope you check these albums out watch the reviews give a listen to tracks that I throw down there in the description and that's about it have a good day let me know what some of your favorite music was over the past month in the comments see ya the like and drink some water make sure you're hydrated eat some fruits and vegetables and get a good night's sleep and play some smash 
BFK3H5Tl_Lo,Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and now it's time for the most arduous segment on this channel the why you know review where I dip through a series of albums that have come out over the past couple of months that I didn't get a chance to review in full sand I'm just going to talk about them in brief a little bit over here let's go famed instrumental and post rock band comes through with a really underwhelming comeback record probably some of the most underwhelming post rock I've heard since Mogwai thought they should start making electronic music with guitars this thing has a lot of attitude some dishevelled songs it's a little pretentious to the point where I really couldn't stand it anymore but if you're into alternative hip-hop and you're into hip-hop that rides on the fringes and spoken-word that rides on the fringes then most definitely check this thing out especially if you are a fan of Saul Williams fantastic spoken-word performances and poetry which I do recommend you check out if you are not familiar with this man it's just I don't really think his artistry and his talent fully translates over to the musical medium he does have some interesting tracks here and there not only on this but his previous records but he doesn't have a full-length LP that I've loved from beginning to end but again I do find a lot of his poetry and his performances to be stunning Kevin gates southern rapper and Instagram clown comes through with a project that is commercial in the worst way he sounds like pretty much every trap rapper on the planet who is desperate for radio play that he is not going to get not a good project really focus grouped really bland and just too glitzy and sugary alright so my phone here says it's 2016 but that can't be the case because no one in their right mind would release this past 1999 I wasn't listening to panic at the disco in 2006 and I'm not going to start listening to them in 21 6 not not happening worst mixtape futures put out in a while hands down total filler total leftovers and some of the worst and most obnoxious djay drops I've heard on a tape in a while a couple of songs here and there it feels like future does a little bit more of lyrical narrative gets kind of personal but a vast majority of this stuff again is just unkempt leftovers former immortal frontman goes solo on his first big solo debut and it's not bad it's a heavy loud clean black metal record reminds me quite a bit of immortals last album though that record did receive mixed reviews from some fans because they didn't like how the band was going in this cleaner direction abbath continues that over here but there's nothing really that striking about it to me I mean I like the sound I like the mix some of the songs are okay but to me it sort of reminded me of the Satanist behemoths the Satanist but way less epic and grand and panoramic oh this thing is all proficiency and like almost no soul and I can only hope that this is the record that puts the final nail into rock operas coffin it's like listening to all these ideas compiled from King Crimson Rush Pink Floyd and Queen then they're just bleached to death so that all of the personality and everything that was gritty about those bands is just sucked out of the equation and then what's left over is just overblown into two freakin hours what happened here to this what happened to this the recording on this thing is is awful it does not sound as good as the production on the previous two Christian mistress albums nor are the performances that great why do I feel like I'm listening to a totally different band oh ow ow ow ow ow this album is a depressingly formulaic which is kind of surprising given just how eclectic Eleanor's music used to be when she was putting out music with her brother in the Fiery Furnaces just not really feeling this one unfortunately oh I got papacy got a lot of papacy got a lot of sinners trying to dreamy on my energy that try to take away from Bishop fucking with the Pope and pray for you bishop sia unfortunately on this record did not come through with as enjoyable and experience as her last full-length LP feels like in order to maintain the mainstream success that she won with that last record she kind of rendered her very triumphant sound down to its most overblown basic and in-your-face elements sort of losing the subtle beauty in the dynamics of the last record in favor of something that's just kind of OneNote feels like kind of a rehash but less details and so much more desperate for you to think it's catchy oh I seriously tried to like this I seriously tried on numerous occasions I think the dead body single is really good but much of the rest of the record is just so slow and overly emotional and emotional I guess while I do hear that little Sims sounds sad and very moody and a lot of cuts here I don't necessarily connect with it so yeah and next a hip hop artist whose mixtapes recent mixtapes people have been just on my case to review and talk about this latest one over here I can't say I'm too crazy about either I'm just not seeing the sky style or exactly what the angle is that he's taking in his music that has people so excited he just kind of sounds like a moody internet trap rapper to me and for every decent song that is on this project there's another one that's totally awful and completely unbearable I love the track Red Alert and it sounded like on this project over here this song and a few others he was really trying to do something a little more commercial little catchy or definitely a banger the song is well-crafted and in some respects it's catchy but then we have cuts like Illuminati love could not stand that track not even for a second then there's the song I know which seems to be one of the big singles from this thing and that song is totally underwhelming totally drab do not get what's so appealing about that track and then the song how we do it which samples the famed 90s single I could not sit through at all I thought of was completely tasteless and how it sampled that Montell Jordan song I like Jazz's deep voice but a lot of his lyrics just don't really say anything to me yeah it's it's it's decent it's okay it's not the worst thing in the world I guess I'm just not seeing my as is how I would put it and that's the why you know review those are all the records that I'm talking about on this video or I'll transition and there's the Y you know review thank you for watching I hope you're doing well more reviews on the way what do you think I should review next what did you think of these records that I you know sort of passed up on the most part did you love them hate them why and not forever 
-s-U06o04KA,hey everyone it's no thneed tight a know here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Rihanna record anti international pop in R&B singing sensation Rihanna finally following up her 2012 LP unapologetic fans have been waiting four years for this moment she has teased relentlessly up to this point with a sporadic slew of non-album singles including songs like pour it up as well as bitch better have my money as well as the song American oxygen only the song work all these singles in between the release of this and her last album only work actually ended up making it onto this project which I guess is unfortunate because one of my least favorite singles that she's put out over the past few years now this album over here sadly it's not really the bold risky move that I was hoping that Rihanna would take to sort of turn the page onto the next chapter of her career what's going to keep Rihanna interesting and exciting for the next five to ten years I'm not sure after listening to this it's not really that imaginative nor does it find Rihanna that unique or stunning of a sound and it's completely lacking in song ideas for at least a third of the record the track consideration which kicks the whole LP off is not a bad start to the album really feels like an intro Rihanna delivers her voice over this kind of rigid boom-bap B that seems very textured sort of dirty in a way it kind of reminds me of some production the Tyler the Creator would pull together but it doesn't necessarily ruin the track or anything like that if anything makes the song underwhelming and maybe I'm a little more forgiving on this because it feels like an intro and it's kicking off the LP it's that it's not structured all that well for the most part there's not really a strong verse or a chorus here feels like Rihanna though her vocal performance is good and the melodies that she's delivering are pretty jazzy it's it's like she's improving more than she's actually delivering anything that he's written which is cool it would have sounded great over a bridge or in some kind of you know vocal solo spot or toward the end of a song but just this itself doesn't really make for a compelling tune but this is kind of the vibe of the entire LP it's very loose it's very casual it doesn't really seem like hours upon hours upon hours of really intense song craft were kind of logged into this project especially when you give a listen to the very next song on here which is just sort of a brief interlude that's kind of lifeless and very under written it sounds just like an unfinished demo the song work which I guess was the big single from this thing probably because it has a Drake feature on it is one of the most obnoxious tracks on the entire LP this thing just does not have a chorus so in place of a chorus Rihanna just repeats the word work the subdued beat is boring the vs. are drab there's absolutely nothing exciting or interesting about this track it's sort of catchy but the only thing that makes it catchy is the incessant repetition of the word work I mean if I repeated a word over and over and over it would get stuck in your head too not to mention that the Drake feature on this thing is nothing of note on the song yeah I said it not only does this track lack a good tune but it's just a very breezy subdued neo-soul ballad where Rihanna's vocals just don't show their true potential she's just kind of got this breathy lifeless delivery that a lot of people putting out music of this type on the internet half today mostly because they don't have the vocal talent to do anything else so why rihanna is kind of stooping down to their level and doing something just as forgettable and just as uninteresting I don't know Rihanna needed better songwriters on this thing way better songwriters and nowhere is that more apparent than on the song whoo which is easily the worst song here Travis Scott brings the production which I was pretty excited to hear about that because I loved rodeo but his sound does not compliment Rihanna at all on this track not only that but this beat is awful I would not want to hear anybody on this beat ever I would want to hear this beat by itself it has this ugly shrill tinny guitar line that is so crappy and so cheap it just repeats over and over and over skip to any point in this song the same crappy guitar line is repeating again and again and again not only that but there's these really clumsy auto-tune whoo it's like Rihanna and Travis Scott actively tried to make the worst song that they could the drums are stiff lifeless they have no flavor there's no groove to this thing Jesus I'm sorry but there's just like nothing defensible about this song now I will say there are some decent Tunes some decent songs the core of a few of these tracks in the first half songs like kid sick get sick is it bad as well as desperado these songs have cleanly and clearly crafted verses and choruses Rihanna's vocal talent really shows on these tracks but the production is kind of skeletal underwhelming to the point where it doesn't allow the songs full potential to flourish especially kiss it better which I think could have used a heavier punch here more captivating rhythm the instrumentation on this thing isn't full it's not colorful it's lacking it's empty Rihanna sounds really unsupported on this it's not even minimal in a way that's interesting or moody like with Drake's if you're reading this is too late mixtape okay going deeper into the project we have the song same old mistakes a hyped song which was kind of billed as a cover of a tame impala track that appeared on their album currents however this thing is not a cover it's a glorified remix at best some decent karaoke at worst kind of reminds me of what is Elia banks did with that Ariel pink song off of her last LP except I guess Rihanna's take on this tame impala song is actually tolerable Rihanna does absolutely nothing to the song I mean her and her producers literally sample the song itself most likely with the band's permission I mean obviously but they just sample the instrumental and then just put Rihanna over it it just reads to me as the mainstream mining for song ideas from smaller artists because they're completely lacking in any sort of songwriting inspiration which is pretty obvious from tracks like whoo the only redeeming thing about this record are the last four songs so prising Lee the album takes a turn for the better and it turns really quickly the song never ending is a little acoustic ballad very pretty and rihanna gives a heartfelt vocal performance on this one then there's love on the brain this one takes kind of a an old-school Motown 3/4 soul song style on this one and even though the blueprint in the formula is super obvious and just laid out in front of Rihanna I mean there's no way she could have screwed this up it's kind of a fail-safe she does an amazing performance on this track it's like she really channels her inner Etta James on this thing the song Helia is equally gorgeous and equally inspired it has a great build up to love it when she reaches up into her range but this track is just 2 minutes just criminally short with such a great songwriting moment on this project I don't see why Rihanna and her producers wouldn't just string it out into something a little more satisfying and complete the song close to you is a somber intimate piano ballad which is very dreary ends the album off on a sad note and I think again one of the better Tunes on the project here but these four tracks are really not enough to redeem the very boring drab and lifeless tracks that preceded them unfortunately this project just did not do much for me I don't even really hear anything on this project in terms of like a big smash hit that I could hear repeating again and again and again on the radio or being streamed endlessly on various music platforms well considering this thing's on title I mean you know jay-z and company are already preventing that unfortunately Rihanna just did not deliver much on this project she and her producers were really not ambitious on this one I have to say to be completely honest while a lot of Rihanna's vocal performances are pretty decent on this thing as far as the songs and the production go here it feels like a lot of this project is still under construction it's just been given to us and sold to us anyway I'm feeling a decent strong 4 on this thing transition have you given this project - listen there's a lot of did you hate what would you rate it you two best you the best what should i review next smash that like if you wipe and that's about it me playing in the background Rihanna anti forever 
EssKgFxVQPI,oh hey I'm recording this intro it got messed up so hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a vital update where i show you the records the latest

emotional mugger if you're into psych rock if you're in a punk rock if you're in a garage rock do give this thing a listen I love the record it's super punky it's super noisy it's very low fie it's got kind of a you know just like a plain white tape I like how kind of a grimy the packaging sort of looks and how DIY the packaging sort of looks kind of like this dirty xeroxed sort of look to the album art looks like a bunch of you know like clippings from magazines were sort of glued together and then thrown into a black-and-white copier it looks it looks so cheap and so crabby but so cool I I love this record you guys can see if you dig back into my videos that I did a review of this project recently I thought it was really great I saw this thing was like on the Drag City site for a bucks super cheap I liked the album I want to support the record the label ty Segall and also just the sound of the project it just sounded like it would sound so good on tape to me I mean it sounded like it was recorded on an old beat-up just dusty tape cassette so I mean what better format to listen to it on and when I gave it a listen it was superb AC super thick everything was bleeding into each other it was real heavy it was real you know just uh dense so I I would say I made the right choice this thing sounded great on cassette just good quality cassette over here and yeah I really enjoy it so there you go right there for that well throw that right here for now all right this next thing is an interesting little box set an interesting little project music from Johnny Jewell here the people over at Italians do it better sent this my way this is basically the soundtrack or you know I guess music from the soundtrack of the new movie Lost River or you know the movie Lost River film by Ryan Gosling that's this little box set of music from the movie and there is a there is a CD so if you open up the box that there is a CD over here so there is that but what sort of makes this thing interesting I mean it's a gorgeous little box that open it up you get this beautiful sort of you know still very wonderful purple kind of image over here you get a bit of a little booklet over here with looks like shots from the film that's really nice any fan of this movie should enjoy the out of this but what's cool about the movie soundtrack here is that they come on the songs all come on individual flexi discs which is so cool oh my gosh really cool guys really cool I mean flexi discs the sounds not going to be the best you know I mean they're never the best on flexi discs but it's a cool concept and you know and for those who you know aren't in love with the sound quality of flexi discs the the the CD is here you know so you just want to listen to it at CD quality you got the CD but these cool little collectors flexi discs you know this flexi de series really cool this is a cool idea this is a cool concept so um you know shout out to Johnny dual shout out to a Italians do it better very cool stuff over here all right for anybody who's a fan of that film and you know and Johnny Joule so there you go all right so let's go on to something that I think some of you were going to be familiar with saw this in my local record shop shout-out to red scroll this was sitting up there used German pressing although it says in the corner over here there's a sticker this is made in the United Kingdom but I'm guessing it was sold in Germany it's a fresh so that fresh but it's a very clean pristinely kept copy of swans filth gave this thing a spin sounded fantastic super heavy super loud everything I would ever want out of a vinyl copy of this thing it's great and I love the let me get a let me make sure this is yeah I love the the labeling over here there's a set of teeth in the middle of the label over here which is really cool really funny again really heavy record if you're in a noise rock if you're into no wave if you're into just incredibly pummeling relentless abrasive music then look this record up if you can find a copy I mean if not you know get it get a digital copy but uh but yeah great project over there swans adding to my swans collection over here got a little jazz on deck next little jazz on deck we have son Ross strange celestial road if you're looking to get into a little jazz I recommend given this a shot um very funky record very funky nice jazz fusion sort of style on this thing for the most part not the oddest thing I've heard from son Rob as some of the solos are pretty freakish and pretty noisy you know you have to expect at least something sort of weird some kind of left hook some kind of weird experimental thing going on on a son raw record I mean he is very much a jazz oddball which is fine I mean it's what makes him and his music so interesting so intriguing so fantastic if you're looking to uh actually you know I guess I could say that if you're looking to get into son raw this is probably a record that you know isn't going to be too hard or difficult to make sense of or make heads or tails of like I said very funky very sweet harmonious enjoyable record and yeah I mean that's that's really all I have to say about it you know really enjoyed the first half that I was spinning alright this one I spun some tracks off of this though I'm very you know very familiar with this record at this point I've given this a review you guys can look that up my buddy Austin hooked me up with this for Christmas this past Christmas a copy of Scott Walker's bish Bosch an album that is just as freakish as as it was the day I reviewed it this album's filthy lyrics frightening instrumentation and fart jokes still bewilder me to this day yeah this thing this thing is a hell of a ride it's a nightmare on record it's easily one of the oddest things I own one of the oddest things I've ever heard still to this day even with all of the just the mess the sea of pretentious indulgent experimental avant-garde music out there I feel like Scott Walker just in this one fell swoop just like surpassed so many of those very very indulgent records with this project by going completely out past the fringes total  freak show on this thing yeah and the the packaging itself inside is a pretty straightforward we have black records black sleeves black labeling black album cover and we actually have a cool little booklet that comes along with the project that has a lot of the very strange lyrics of this thing written out which is a totally fine the lyrics are that weird that I would want to read into them possibly along with the playing of the records so you know it's a nice little addition to the package I have a picture of Scott killing it right there and yeah that's that's about it for this one this record over here this oddball so yeah really cool I was a-telling Austin that you know now that I have this all I need is a vinyl copy of Lulu you know and then I will have two of the weirdest records I've heard in the in the past five years so there you go in two of the most polarizing records I've heard in the past five years here's a record that's not so polarizing a good rock record gave it a positive review when it came out a little while ago really psychedelic really Punk really in your face lots of guts these guys came out with a record last year thought it was decent prefered this one a little bit more I'm talking about dope bodies lifer dope body lifer lifer lifer it's backwards on the back nothing crazy to report with the packaging over here white sleeve black record sort of weird kind of cluttered layering over here very simple text on the titles and everything but the record itself sounds great the bass boosts really nicely in this chaotic mix which I thought digitally was a little brittle but it sounds more balanced on the record I would say and yeah I mean it's just a great sound and Psyche Punk LP so give this thing a listen if you're looking for something that's got a lot of bleed got a lot of guts got a lot of energy to it and has a very live-in-the-moment feel cool alright this next one's a bit of a throwback a metal record that I loved back in high school still think it's great today although I did give up my CD copy of this thing a long time ago I do regret it and now that I guess I have this I'm just kind of happy to see a reincarnated I guess on to a double LP talk about Pantera's Vulgar Display of power turn turn and turn and turn and turn and I do I look like this guy over here good punch so yeah it is a very thick incredibly heavy super freakin heavy double LP set and when you see how yeah I mean it's wow this is a thick record this is it thick nice thick record this feels like 180 feels like a 180 grand thing at least like 160 this is a nice thick record for this and the the packaging reads a lot like the packaging that I remember when I had the CD of of this thing I vividly remember this image on here and I vividly remember these pictures of the band in my CD copy so so this is like a bit of a nostalgic thing for me this looks like kind of an inverted version of what the other sleeve is I mean it's exactly that it looks like just an inversion of the black and white photos that are on the other sleeve this other record seems incredibly thick too so yeah this is a very heavy heavy package you can you can see from just how fat and thick the the double LP sort of binder is over here how heavy this thing is the very heavy double LP so can't can't express how excited I am to have that album back in my life so alright a couple more over here umm I needed more Nick cave in my life so I got this copy of Murder Ballads soft for a good price I don't really have much of any Nick Cave vinyl you know I have a bunch of Nick Cave CDs but I really have any Nick Cave violin this is one of his Bad Seeds albums that I've heard lots of songs off of including Henry Lee and stagger Lee and I just haven't owned it on vinyl you know so I just figured why not you know let's just get this double LPS white sleeves not a gatefold but you know a good record to have if you're into some freakishly dark singer songwriters and finally my favorite metal album of 2015 such a clean pristine look on this cover over here I'm talking about the new ghost album ah meliora I actually cannot show you the oh no it isn't here okay okay I thought I thought the record was still in the turntable because I was listening to this record last night but it is a really nice package over here beautiful photo of the band over here very nice photo of the band just a simple black record not too heavy or anything like that a little thinner then I thought the pressing would be but it sounded fine it sounded very pristine it sounded very

Greger now before you listen there a few ways you can support this podcast you can use our Amazon Associates link if you live in the u.s. buying anything on Amazon we get kickback from that link is down there in the description you can also via our support page linked also in the description and you see it in the video screen right now you can subscribe to this podcast get it sent to your email inbox for a small monthly fee you can also just stream it on this YouTube channel share with a friend hit that like leave a comment you can also subscribe to our podcast we have older episodes backlogged there on iTunes the link is also down there in the description and also on our support page there's probably a little merch there you can pick up a classic review which can be set to your email inbox and that's about it cool cool you two best enjoy the show hey everyone anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another episode of the needle drop podcast where we interview content creators from across the internet in this episode my guest is a doctor author public speaker a content creator as i said he runs the nonprofit nutritionfacts.org where you can find daily videos on food health and nutrition so my favorite videos of his are his annual video series his seminars where he talks about things like uprooting the leading causes of death and preventing disease he also has a new book out called how not to die which I just ordered maybe an hour before this interview now that I see that it's recently been released because I saw the that was like a little a funding campaign to sort of get revenue for the book together my guest is dr. Michael Greger hey thanks for coming on man you're just you're just so amped Cole what's what in the world is there not to be amped about that's well nothing really let's let's let's just go let's let's do it this is gonna be a pretty short interview in comparison with my other interviews because I know you have others to get to later today so and I know that you've probably said this to many people before but just for the sake of my audience who are unfamiliar with what you do give us a little bit of an elevator pitch as to what people can find when they go onto nutritionfacts.org juicy facts that org is a free nonprofit science-based public service providing daily updates on the latest in nutrition research via bite-sized videos more than a thousand videos nearly every aspect of healthy eating with new videos and articles uploaded every day nutritionfacts.org dude you got it memorized yes okay so on your website it's very obvious that evidence-based nutrition nutrition studies food studies are very important to you generally where do you find a lot of these studies how do you vet them I mean as you already know and as you'll probably explain to my audience here there are quite a few studies out there where maybe a lobby or company that sells X might put money into a study and lo and behold they find that X is amazing for you and eat tons of it because there are all sorts of health benefits when going through these studies how exactly are you making sure that these conflicts of interest aren't coming up you know science today is fraught with fraud bias sloppiness conflicts of interest you know quietly shelving and burying unfavorable outcomes inappropriate interpretations me you know I figure it's like that Winston Churchill quote you know democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others alright so one can say that the peer-reviewed scientific literature these days is the worst form of evidence except all the other how else can we make life-or-death decisions for ourselves our families our patients but by the best available balance of evidence and so to do that you just need to you know to look at it all so you know I know fourteen thousand or so articles published every year in nutrition um so you know seventy or so a day so you just gotta go through them all make sure you don't miss any and and you know you always want to look to what the funding source is as you mentioned doesn't automatically mean that it's a you know the the study is distorting the science but you just you know it helps to know so you can keep that in the back of your head when you're reading it to make sure that the study design wasn't done in a way to get a you know a favorable result um how long have you sort of been on this journey where you've been searching through these thousands and thousands of studies and and and and before and before you came to this point where you're at now with this book being just released where were you at like ideologically when it came to diet and health I mean is there anything that you didn't know before that you learned as you were going on this journey that sort of caused you to do a 180 on anything that that was sort of just accepted as a general truth to you well this is this is the big five year anniversary to nutrition facts started 2011 so excited to be here in 2016 oh I mean I learn new stuff all the time I mean that when I do videos you think I knew any of that stuff this is all based on new research every time a new article gets published I learned something new and I just passed that something new onto other people but before I pulled up the study I had no idea you know and so my diet changes all the time yeah in fact that's you know one of the reasons I have you know my book I go through this kind of daily dozen checklist of all the things I want to include in my daily routine because you know I'll go along and find something absolutely amazing evidence to support you know adding a tablespoon of flax seeds to one's daily died or a quarter teaspoon of turmeric to one's daily diet I'm just like so pumped I get into the habit and then I just like you know I forget or something and then all of a sudden you know month or two later another amazing article like oh damn forget about the flax seeds again so so I was like darn it alright I'm gonna start I got my whiteboard just made a list like alright oh yeah I got that today I got that oh I forgot to eat berries today alright and check that off um and so that's that's kinda so that's what evolved into this kind of daily dozen things you know excited I wanted the book not to just really kind of to extend beyond the website see the website lists got a thousand videos that's great but can be a little overwhelming you know I do have those your videos that goes you know through the science and twelve months chunks I'm glad you uh I'm glad you appreciate those but you know I wanted to more than just compiled all the most compelling evidence of one place I wanted it to be more kind of a reference book you know practical guide on translating this mountain of data into you know day to day kind of decisions yeah will link to those videos as well as the book down there in the description box even though it seems that a lot of people generally are not sort of taking to heart a lot of the the recommendation the dietary recommendations a sort of that the plant-based community is putting out there it's it's not for lack of interest in health I think I just think there's kind of a bit of a I guess a certain level of confusion that people have in terms of what's healthy eating and and I noticed that a lot of the studies that you reference it seems that you favor them in terms of a they have a certain outcome you know they help this they alleviate that they cure this they sort of prevent this what exactly to you sort of qualifies as a telltale sign of Health or healthfulness or healthy eating because I think for a lot of people health is kind of this nebulous term health is kind of whatever people define it to be if someone just generally feels good feels healthy then they sort of define themselves as such should we be looking at things like disease should we be looking at things like weight gain and BMI to sort of tell us oh wow that's really a red flag the most important thing for me is hard endpoints which is just fancy doctor speak for you know death you know you know the surgery diagnosis you know instead of risk factors you know yes it's interesting to what one's cholesterol is the only reason you care about cholesterol is because you care about the number one cause of death amount of women heart disease only reason you care about you know your blood Sugar's you want to make sure that you know you're not doing damage to your body and pre-diabetic etc and so you know risk factors are helpful because you know you can find those out very short-term so you know you eat healthy enough to go on a plant-based diet in one or two weeks you can drop your cholesterol a significant amount and that just gives you a sense of the kind of direction your body's going in but it's the studies that you know do an intervention fall people out for a couple of years and actually see differences in cancer progression differences in you know the the the the openness of the arteries and you know healthy enough diet you can reverse heart disease opening up arteries without drugs without surgery that's the really exciting stuff but you know you can get some kind of indicators you know if your blood pressure is getting better your cholesterol getting better your blood sugars are down your triglycerides are down these are all good indicators that you know you're moving in the right direction but you want to make sure that you know ideally whatever diet you're eating has been put to the test and an interventional trial that's randomized people into two groups and the diet that you're eating my people did better than any other diet and that's the I mean that's so that's why I eat a plant-based diet cuz there's only one diet ever been proven to reverse heart reverse heart disease the majority of patients this plant-based diet and if that's all it could do reverse our number one killer then shouldn't that be the default diet until proven otherwise in fact it's also effective in treating reversing or resting other leading killers high blood pressure type 2 diabetes just seems to make the case overwhelming so anytime anyone approaches you and says hey did you hear about this other cool diet you know do me a favor I said wait a second that's this nude I've been proven to reverse heart disease you know number one reason me and all my loved ones will die if the answer is no why would you even consider it just makes no sense to me yeah it's um it seems like in that regard that there's there's quite a few different diets to sort of try out I mean people throw out Paleo diet gluten-free low-carb and some people advocate the idea that you could be healthy at any size some people advocate the idea that a sort of will bring up an anecdote and maybe their grandfather ate eggs and bacon and drank whiskey every day and he lived until 101 or something well my my my dad never wore seat belt and didn't die in a car crash so I'm not gonna wear a seat belt well I mean what that's that's what you know reducing risk is all about does a seat belt guarantee you're not gonna die in a car crash no but it reduces your risk that's why we do it that's why anyone with a brain you know takes simple side-effect free solutions to you know to reduce their risk and to reduce the risk of their families and it just you know makes no sense to me that people are um you know are gambling with their lives like that people advocate a lot of stuff but it's the science I mean that's why we have science now we don't have to just like you know dream you know come up with funky little theories we can put them to the test and some diets you know pass with flying colors and other diets kill people I think this is part of the reason why is something that there's a lot of confusion over to these issues to go back to your sort of your seat belt anecdote for a lot of people not wearing a seat belt seems to have a very violent and obvious outcome which causes people who see that outcome not using able to use them whereas earlier when you were talking about the things that you know plant bata plant-based diet prevents and sort of the the things that you could see sort of through a blood test that it lowers people aren't exactly internally feeling the nuances of these differences between a plant-based or a you know sort of an animal product an American sort of standard diet as they're eating it necessarily especially if they're switching from one to the other immediately you're not necessarily going to see everything all the issues that you're dealing with if you are dealing with any sort of alleviated within a day so if you can sort of advocate for a plant-based diet based more on sort of maybe the physical or maybe any visual differences or improvements that people might be seeing as they continue down that road as they continue down that lifestyle because again I think for a lot of people the science doesn't necessarily translate into real-life differences unless we're talking about long-term you know because for a lot of people the the issues with sort of leading a life with the standard American diet those issues don't arise up until sort of it's too late or until they're at a point where they're beyond wanting to change their diet or they're at a point where they're actually you know face to face with heart disease and we're talking about you know sort of 3040 years down the road if they're lucky because it seems like these issues are coming on earlier and earlier I mean I mean that well that's the problem the problem is people aren't you people are eating as if there's no tomorrow in fact I even did a video there's a study of analysis of last meals requested by death row inmates there's just like well what are people actually requesting right and it turns out what people are requesting and they know look you can eat anything you're gonna die the next day right I mean so it's like guaranteed whatever you could eat whatever you want it's not gonna you know who cares what happens right and it turns out that what people order for their last meals before getting executed is pretty much the standard American so people are eating day to day as if you know they're gonna just like drop dead and they're just not putting any thought into the long-term health and well-being now thankfully there are you know it's like people who smoke he's like you smoke cigarettes people feel good the Niki nicotine gives your rush right um and so you just don't worry about well yeah what's gonna happen years down the road you know all you get it's kind of positive feedback get out of your nails turn yellow and you know get some more colds and get coughing or something but I mean in general it's you know it's a positive sensation just like Krispy Kremes are a positive sensation but you know are do it you know or not a good idea for one's long-term health now but thankfully a plant-based diet you go on a healthy diet and you do see immediate benefits so all of a sudden your constipation clears up you sleep better you more energy and we say these are some of the typical things one sees you know reported in these kind of studies for people you know with chronic pain conditions like arthritis or you know i mean--can okay you can get these dramatic improvements people with angina crushing chest pain I'm within weeks that can clear up I mean so and that'll give people the kind of added incentive to keep it up but you know you'll never know how you feel eating healthy unless you give it a try so I encourage people you know try eating out there for a couple weeks and let your body tell you what it thinks of it the standard American diet that you're talking about have those standards today changed drastically from what the standard American diet might have been 50 years ago from your experience and from oh yeah you know it's actually as horrible as it is and you know it's uh or dies the number one cause of death and disability in the country bumping tobacco smoke - killer number two smoking only kills half a million Americans a year where our diet kills hundreds of thousands more but it's actually improved surprisingly I'm so we're actually eating less cholesterol reading less a little less saturated fat but you know we're continuing the same amount of horrible processed foods we're continuing not enough fruits vegetables but it was it was pretty miserable you know for you know the last half century a period but now we have but you know that was before 1991 dr. Dean Ornish proved in his lifestyle hot rodder you can reverse our disease I mean something we didn't even really know was possible um and so you know since that day since July in 1990 not a single person should die should have died then of course hundreds of thousands of people continue to die because they just don't know that we're never given that option doctors don't know it so patients don't know it people are dying unnecessarily families are being devastated unnecessarily that's why I wrote the book how not to die uh you're talking about these sort of slight improvements on the American diet over the past 50 years but still today we're dealing with things like the obesity epidemic what exactly do you sort of attribute to you know what what factors do you see kind of playing out in to that outcome exactly and in the way that people eat today if it's sort of improved by any stretch of the imagination the key to healthy sustainable weight controls adopted either emphasizes nutrient dense but calorically dilute foods sensible such that you know one never has to worry about calorie count and portion control you know we evolved over millions of years eating exceedingly fiber-rich diets probably exceeding like 100 grams a day based on studies of fossilized human feces and so you know and what happens is with that fiber is to go back to our gut convert the fiber in the short chain fatty acids which are absorbing to our bloodstream affect our metabolic hormones reduce our appetite but if we don't eat enough fiber containing plant foods we rob our body of the natural satiety signals so when people eating processed foods people eating animal foods they're eating all these calories but the body just never seemed satisfied and they overeat overeat overeat and then they get fat and sick and a lot of the evidence that you sort of point towards you know picks out animal products meat and specifically you know as having some dangers to consuming on a regular basis are these issues exacerbated today by consuming more of it or how we sort of process it it's it seems like there's a big difference in animal agriculture today versus you know a hundred years ago um well I mean the biggest difference is that it's cheaper so people live more of it I mean it's really a quantity issue so certainly you know we've we've you know we've kind of engineered these animals through selective breeding to you know to fit whatever qualities people want and so you know chickens 100 years ago at 16 fat calories now they have over 200 someone from about 2 grams of fat over 20 grams fat so 10 times more calories from fat 10 times more fat and that's because you know we you know you know we want chickens to be juicy and dripping with you know fat I mean that's what the that's the you know McDonald's wants their big nuggets to be greasy and so yeah so chicken used to be healthier but you know so but the you know I mean no chicken in the universe is any fiber you know animals have bones to hold them up plants that far but hold them up see now I can't get your fighting niches and I hear an oxygen okay you know so it's like you know every everything we put in our mouth has an opportunity cost you know it's a lost opportunity to put something healthier in her mouth and there's nothing healthier on the planet then these whole plant foods so it's like you know every time you're you know taking up you know some calories and you're 2,000 a day calorie bank or whatever with foods that are less than optimally healthy it's you know lost opportunity to do your body right yeah because uh it's it's interesting that you sort of bring up that that factoid about you know finding evidence of fibrous foods in fossils of human feces it seems to go against the general argument that humans evolved eating me and so on and so forth well it's just not me they're talking about the Paleolithic period right the last two million years as if human beings just popped out of existence you know Adam and Eve came around and you know rode some dinosaurs over and poof but you know we we broke off from our great ape ancestors about 20 million years ago it's just their way to say what happened during the first 90% of our evolution well we were plant-based like our fellow great apes and so our biochemistry our bodies our organ systems everything evolved in this context of plant foods and then but so only you know the last kind of 10% did we you know we start seeing evidence but you know you know you know scarring on bones that suggests we started using tools to start butchering etc and of course it was a boon to human civilization because we evolved in a in a context of famine essentially so anytime you can get calorie dense foods like brains and bone marrow or stuff gives you a better chance to live in to reproductive age to pass along your genes but you know that's not the problem we have right now getting enough calories to survive till puberty the problem we have now is these chronic diseases of older age and we have a wonderful body of science that can tell us what to do to avoid those chronic diseases the good news is we have a tremendous power of our health destiny longevity the vast majority of premature death and disability is preventable with a plant-based another healthy lifestyle behavior so let's do it but a lot of these preventable diseases it seems like to the medical community as well as the people who are suffering from them there's still so many mysteries around the way these diseases work and and almost a mystery as to why this person came to get the disease you know sort of like a why me sort of thing almost to the point where when they see someone like you is sort of saying what they're saying almost as if these dietary choices are a silver bullet it's kind of hard to believe you know in in your opinion how much of a silver bull are we talking about you know in terms of some of these diseases we're talking about a diet that can reverse the disease not slow it down not just stop it but actually cure the disease you can have type 2 diabetes go on a plant-based diet and then not have type 2 diabetes you can have hypertension number one respect for death in the world and then not have high blood pressure off all drugs thanks to a healthy diet when you treat the cause of disease about 80 percent of our death and disabilities these chronic did lifestyle diseases so if you treat the cause of the disease then the disease gets better I mean this era minutes it's I mean it's common sense and it works and it's been put to the test it's not theory it's not just someone's opinions we randomized people to two different diets when one half gets better the other half get continues to get worse which half do you want to be in all right moving on from from here what can you tell us a little bit just a tease toward this book that you've recently released what can people look forward to in this book that they haven't necessarily seen in your videos I understand that you pretty uh that you do some specific dietary recommendations in this book and sort of go into sort of what you're eating on a daily basis and so I'm chapters on the raw diet may play in preventing and resting refers to each over 15 leading cause of death so I just go you know 15 job is with each of our 15 leading causes of death chapter on each you know three thousand citations just go through and so there's all the compelling signs and then okay well how do you actually make it work in your life and your family's life well that's the second half of the book where I go through you know the kind of traffic light system said what are the healthiest foods or the least healthy foods what I mean by processed foods what I mean by plant-based and then these are the foods we've really got to try to get to our daily diets here's the daily doesn't how much exercise how much beverages what self these sweeteners just go on and on all the real practical stuff that you know people ask me questions all the time so you know yes there's the science that like there is on the website but then I just kind of get a little more personal the book it allowed me the flexibility to go beyond just sticking to the science and be like alright well in my professional opinion this is what you know what I'm eating for breakfast now is there a study saying that if I eat this for breakfast something's gonna happen no but I mean you know all I'm just that's why there's never been a video about it but because you know it's just like alright I've read all these studies you know how do I make it work in my life and so I just want to share that and if it works for people great if it doesn't that's fine too you should take the same body of evidence and find a way to you know to use that same body of evidence to eat in a different way as long as you're you know following these general principles hmm yeah I mean personally it's been interesting to sort of see a channel talking about the types of dietary guidelines that you talked about and it not be a vlog channel you know how it it not be sort of a personal exploration into these foods it's very science-based it's very fact oriented it's referenceable and you know it sort of stands up to the criticism that a lot of people throw at these types of recommendations that you know it's sort of just made up it's just you know feel-good science it's just kind of vegan propaganda or something oh no I have no patience for that i'ma just you know I mean anybody anytime anyone says anything about an important topic now look you're doing a music review say whatever the hell you want right say whatever the hell you feel but when you're talking about something that life or death talking about something that could hurt people or that could help people then you gotta have your stuff together I mean you really got it you know you weren't born with this knowledge so how did you come about it did you just hear about it did you read about it somewhere where did you read about it let's let's track this back to the primary source to see if there's any credibility to it but instead people just make pronouncements you know like a guru just says we'll do this you know don't question I'm that I I that dad that annoys me I mean again if you're talking about something trivial then fine say what did tell people to do whatever you want but you know when it's something you know when someone says you know put butter in your coffee or something I mean it's like oh you know you realize you're gonna hurt people right I mean like literally hurt people and and unfortunately I don't think people take that responsibility serious enough um and so that's why there's nothing on my site almost nothing I mean sometimes I can't help but have a little my opinion sneak in there but I really work hard to be like like everything I cite in fact you look at my videos there's the paper right there how about the reference did I show it to you right there there's the graph there's the illustrations there's their quotes right in front of you you know did I interpret it wrong both look here's the link split on sources cited here's the link stall you know pull down the PDF read it yourself you know maybe I made a mistake you know the you know jump right in here let's do this together because it's a matter of life and death is we're talking about your family's health so you gotta take this serious you can't just just you know believe somebody because they said it you have to get at the best approximation of the truth all right I want to thank dr. Michael Greger for coming on the show and talking about his new book and sort of the dietary guidelines that have come out of his fantastic website nutritionfacts.org Mike thanks for coming on the show so glad to be here "
yRQ1QZs7Q0w,hey everyone infini turn tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new massive attack EP ritual spirit legendary trip hop duo massive attack is back with a new EP with this EP they are following up their semi-decent 2010 album Heligoland which came out six years ago obviously the duo is not in a rush to come out with another full-length album but a new full-length LP around the corner would be nice especially since this new EP over here is surprisingly good there's some pretty sharp features on this thing we have UK rapper roots maneuver we also have tricky on here Zico as well as Scottish hip hop and experimental pop outfit young fathers massive attack essentially just kind of supporting some young blood right there on those two tracks this thing is 18 minutes it's pretty much to the point the opening track dead editor's it's murky it's nocturnal it's super dark routes maneuvers very deep vocals fit perfectly over this track he's rapping over this deep sub bass I love the way the hi-hat plays on the offbeat on this cut it's just a well-crafted catchy incredibly moody song that shows massive attack really wearing where they're from on their sleeves and that's something that I think has always come out in their music in a beautiful way trip hop and downtempo that is as textured and as introspective is this is what UK electronic music has always been about for me as equals vocals on this cut are delivered in a really eerie falsetto and I love how the percussion the synthesizers and the guitars on this track all layer together in a really organic and beautiful way there's nothing super I guess rigid about how this instrumentation develops despite it being assembled on a digital platform and on the cut voto in my blood with young fathers I could not have dreamed of this collaboration coming together as well as it actually did young fathers very lively group vocals fit over a drum circle of percussion both synthetic and organic and there's actually some very moody backing instrumentation thrown into the mix too it reminds me a lot of the very pretty and also dark and grimy material off of young fathers first two mixtapes and the closer take it there with tricky is the most devilish track in the whole bunch Tricky's vocals are raspy they're deep they're monstrous they're unsettling the lumbering piano notes that fit against his vocals as well as the very dramatic instrumentation that sort of swells up and develops progresses toward the end of the track are really nice and that's pretty much the EP in a nutshell I don't really have many complaints about it I mean it's sort of short so inherently it's not going to be as satisfying as a record but I don't have any big critiques to throw at any one of these songs the only thing this EP leaves me wanting is more I mean any of these songs I think would have sounded fantastic on a full-length album which again I hope is just around the corner I'm feeling a strong seven to a late eight on this thing transition have you given the CP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate at you the best you the best what should I review next yeah what up do you forever 
NkEYtSa44z4,hey everyone advance city tat a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new chairlift record Mothe chairlift american synth pop duo they've been at it for over 10 years now they've three records under their belt and the amount of progression from their first record to their latest is pretty apparent when you go back and listen to that debut record and hear how amateurish kind of quirky it is it's like a night and day difference from this very clean slick commercial record of theirs that they have just released now the dual was in the midst of this transition on their last full-length album something which dropped in 2012 the album I thought was occasionally bland but it had some good songs plus frontwoman Caroline polo check is one of the better female singers when it comes to these new trendy synth pop indie flavoured male/female duo's I didn't know much about this album going into it and to be honest I didn't expect too much I mean something I thought was a decent it was a solid record but much of it hasn't really stuck with me over the past several years however with this new LP over here I think lake chairlift is maybe at least with some of the tracks making a little bit more of an impression on me this record has an OBS build the songs on this thing are like from 2 to 4 minutes 10 tracks it's pure unadulterated pop with very clear direct choruses and verses but it has a bit of class it's very subtle it's very soft on the ears aesthetically it sounds like it would go over really well playing over the loudspeaker in like forever 21 or something but there's more to this album beyond its kind of cushy smooth ethereal production for one Caroline delivers some good vocal performances on this thing her voice strikes me as very pretty very soft on the ears at moments reminds me a bit of Julia halter on her latest record you guys must know at this point how much I loved that last year I loved on the opening track here not only are a lot of Caroline's vocal lines very very melodic very beautiful but I love the very sharp shouts of a lookout that sliced through the walls of very airy synthesizers and soft orange and there are these really driving guitars playing very quietly in the background it's like listening to a mix of 2000 Zehra indie pop mixed with a bit of 80s new wave and I do mean that in the best way possible Caroline's vocals are very cool but confident on the song polymorphic a track that is quiet but is also very funky has this miniature little playful groove to it that I like a lot with some horns that are kind of sassy it's sort of like I'm listening to a very quiet Tom Tom Club and then her vocals soar over the very bright synthesizers on the song Romeo and and her vocals are kind of matched with these oddly sexual moans right after she sings of the hook which are kind of strange but a ear grabbing the buzzing guitars that that build into the verse on this song give the track a bit of edge - oh now the production generally is not as rough and is textured and is flavorful as I would like certainly not enough to make this album super fiery bold and exciting but I can hear that little odd details are being placed into these very soft sweet songs to kind of give them a distinct character against so much music out there right now this sounds like this there is something to listen to beyond chairlifts ultra clean and shiny exterior and not just sonically but musically - there's some really pretty counterpoint especially from the horns coming through on the song cha-ching some very cool metallic bits of percussion as well and there's some really rubbery bouncy sub bass on this track at one point it's kind of like chairlift is nodding to the idea of making a banger but they're really not going hard enough for this song to be that however the track moth to flame is is this album's true dance anthem it has a driving house beat and I actually wish more tracks on this record were as lively the song crying in public is a very soft ballad on this record but it's packed with all these sparkling layers of tones on the chorus and it has one of the better vocal melodies on the entire LP and there's some kind of weird noisy glitchy samples that are that are looped in a very herky-jerky kind of way on the song Ottawa to Osaka one of the otter tunes on the entire record but I still admire it for taking a risk that so many other tracks on this album don't which kind of brings up my main issue with this LP and maybe it was an issue I had with chairlifts last album - and that's that there are some interesting experiments and ideas on this thing but they're all so faint to the point where they sort of just blend into the homogeneously smooth aesthetic of the entire album which makes the record sort of breezy and sleepy to me you know not something I'm really excited to listen to it's it's very much background music background pop sophisticated and occasionally interesting background pop but it sort of falls into the again background for me chairlift isn't so much a duo for me that reads as exciting and fun and just euphoric instead they're just kind of really playing it laid back and cool and maybe that's what you want to hear personally I would have liked a few more upbeat tracks and for the duo to just not sound like they're shying away from coming off too aggressive because they don't want to alienate anybody I enjoy the meteor cuts on the second half of this record especially like the songs show you off which is easily the sexiest track on the entire record where we have Caroline pulla tracks singing about taking serious pride in her lover the track features this kind of funky Michael Jackson s groove while there's a bit of modern instrumentation in there that kind of reads like the new Carly Rae Jepsen album and again in a good way the slower and more abstract more obtuse cuts in the track listing here are nowhere near as satisfying especially on the song unfinished business where the vocals are kind of raw but sort of feeble as well as Caroline goes through these vocal movements that at times read like Bjork but not quite as stunning and the last track here is easily the most indulgent in the bunch and it's sort of like listening to every odd and slightly experimental idea executed on the previous tracks held within these really sharp pop songs all thrown together to sort of collide into a very unmemorable junk pile to close out the album in a really unsatisfying manner but at least a majority of the tracks leading up to this point were good overall I thought this record was decent certainly some of chairlifts best material to date on this thing and I think they're continuing to mature while simultaneously taking a few risks here and there but I just wish this album would kind of take the plunge rather than sort of just you know dip its toes looking very fashionable and it's really expensive swimsuit and it has its hair done and has some really sweet sunglasses and everything it's just kind of chilling on the side of the pool I personally am looking for the pop record that's gonna go get it and ball oh hopefully that puts my feelings accurately about this album still a decent record though if you're looking for a nice breezy sweet indie pop record to kick off your 2016 I see no reason not to check this out I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing Tran oh I've given this a listen did you love it - J hate it what would you rate it smash that like ride your bike YouTube s and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana chairlift forever 
VhZH6xAzlY8,uh hey everyone what's the punch tanto here the Internet's punch punch punch and it's time for a punch of the new pop twelve eighty record punch pop twelve eighty they are sacred bones records Sinese who hit me pretty hard on their debut full-length album several years ago which was this really dark heavy kind of industrial noise rock mess of just the head crushing guitars and bass monstrous scary drums it was kind of cacophonous to the point where the band drowned itself out into anonymity and there wasn't really too much about the record other than its solid songs and and some pretty animalistic performances that set itself apart from any other group this was kind of raising hell on record not exactly an original style I guess I will say but it was played with guts but to be completely honest their next full-length album it just completely fell through the cracks for me it's like the band just was not on my radar but what's funny about sort of missing out on pop Toby Dee's last album is skipping directly from the debut to this new LP over here it's like I'm listening to a new band entirely they went from this sort of faceless murky incredibly heavy noise rock to something that's way more cyntha driven and gothic and sort of industrial and tortured depraved and freakish the music here is chaotic and it's just brooding it's like a weird monster chained by its neck to a wall in a torture chamber and like it's just writhing and thrashing at you if I was into BDSM this would be the soundtrack the record is kind of slow going to start and it might be to ward off more impatient listeners from partaking in the hellish musical experience that will be coming shortly after the intro the band delivers this mind-numbing percussion loop which is kind of off-kilter and then they swap these moments out with these huge bursts of distorted digital sound the vocals are kind of campy but they come off super sinister it's like I'm listening to the intro song to a really gruesome underground hardcore bloody slasher B horror movie like as soon as the just heavy distorted synths bustin I'm seeing like a blood-red title and just like all this dripping goo and ooze coming down the screen I'm reminded of the current record that came out last year a little bit I reminded in terms of the vocals like of Marilyn Manson or a bit of Nine Inch Nails I'm reminded of synth bunkers like suicide of goth rock and death rock bands like Christian death and there's something about this record that kinda reminds me of a very demented and violent and dark version of what Liars were doing on their last full-length albums so stylistically and sonically there's a lot of influences I think playing into this album but I don't know if you need to be an expert on any of them to enjoy what pop Toby T is doing on this project all you really need to know is that this thing is dark it is hellish the band takes a decidedly more aggressive approach on the next track it's noisy its synth punkish it's got a liar cuz a little goth and it's from the future so it's not just synth Punk it's like cyberpunk the vocal performance is devilish on this track the dude comes off legitimately like demonic and behind these vocals we get layer upon layer upon layer of all these like brittle twittering noises sort of just incessantly just creating all this static over this monstrous bass coming from the sense and the drums the band is just really just really they're just rushing you with every frequency they have and by the next track in silico it's like the band gets even more intense it's like they're actively trying to terrorize the listener with the music making especially given that in the first third of this there are all these proclamations coming through the vocals that you know like the way their sounds and of course immediately after that comes a bunch of very brittle shrill shots of cymbals and just really industrial floor tom drum fills all the sense all the drums all the vocals there's a lot of sound bleed in this mix and it's all kind of swirling together into something that's intense and explosive and psychedelic the song crow midea cools it down a little bit on the aggression I like the track a lot it's kind of smooth its Spacey and it really provides a much-needed lull after some very trying and very intense moments just previous to this track I think it feels like a much needed and a very well crafted interlude which makes me kind of wonder why the band and the label used it as like a promotional single as a song by itself it's kind of underwhelming but in the grander scheme of the album it makes a little more sense not only does it show a bit of diversity but it's also the sound of the band pulling me further into the sewage pipe that this album lives in and not to totally attack the way that this record has been promoted or anything like that I mean promoting an album like this to people who might not necessarily be into intense and noisy music is a tough sell there's not much in the way of tracks on this thing that I could call catchy or accessible in any kind of way but the song USS ISS does come close the synth and guitar leads on this thing actually repeat quite often they're dark they're powerful they're catchy and there's actually a head bobbing groove to this thing it doesn't just you know sound like it's working to the rhythm of a very violent beating to an innocent person however the record just gets weirder from here like on the track rain song it's kind of droney sort of ambient there are all these shocking noises that just kind of pierce the spaces of silence there are some very distant vocals some very creepy performances it's indulgent but it's unsettling but slowing the record down at this point does kind of kill the momentum a little bit especially with the last Undertaker not a track that I hate but as we're nearing the close of the record I just kind of wish there were more you know bangers here here here but the album does finish off very strong the track Kingdom Come is easily one of the most intense cuts here and it feels like the band is playing and this really live-in-the-moment fluid way as they're speeding toward the finish of this track and there's kind of intensifying more and more if the song goes on nothing here mood-wise that wasn't already displayed on the previous cuts but I guess it's it's not unwonted since the band has done such a good job of creating a semi interesting flow to this record there definitely peaks and valleys you see this thing was an interesting listen and a record that I see myself coming back to not only because I think the production is just top-notch intense and abrasive but the vocals have way more character I think than they did on the two previous pop 1280 records I mean the vocals are so raw they're upfront they're just not being given anywhere to hide and I think the band and this record has benefited a lot from that if you're looking for a nightmare on record then check this thing out I'm feeling a strong 7 to a late 8 on this project transition have you given this album a listen did you love it could you hate it what would you rate it would you like me to review another thing or would you like me to stop reviewing forever let me know you want me to review next down there in the comments smash the like and have a good day okay you're the best 
3KciKKu7XP8,oh I'm too tired for this right now hey everyone a flattened e'er here the Internet's busiest music nerd doing a quick review slash reaction to these two tracks over here as you may or may not know b.o.b is an Atlanta rapper and producer multi-instrumentalist and he's uh been pretty popular on the Twitter lately because he's been launching a series of tweets supporting Flat Earth Flat Earth conspiracy the idea that the earth is not round it is it is flat not a sphere flat could be trolling but he seems real real devoted to the stupidity some people do insist me he's trolling man he's trolling but boy is he dedicated to the point where after saying all this stuff let me give you a bit of the play-by-play after saying all this stuff tweeting all this stuff none other than Neil deGrasse Tyson responds to him corrects him and then he drops a diss track and God is it awful which isn't really anything new to expect from b.o.b his music is usually incredibly mediocre I mean it's pretty much the reason I skipped his last full-length album but this track in particular is is a beauty the beat is okay there's nothing really wrong with the instrumental here and and bo bees flow and delivery are mostly on point he's not really the best lyricist or rapper in the game but he certainly has a bare minimum of talent when it comes to that but the lyrics on this thing are absolutely god-awful in their reasoning b.o.b paints this picture of himself as if saying all this stuff about the flat earth and and oh if the South earth round how come the Sun all these stupid harebrained conspiracy theories that can be debunked by just not only simple observation and reason and logic but very basic science I will actually link to a great video down there in the description box where fellow youtuber armored skeptic sort of dip bung some common flat earther arguments it's pretty funny it's pretty entertaining but he seems to think that because he's being so willfully dumb that he's like a revolutionary comparing himself to Malcolm X like he's really usually fightin the man by saying this stuff to what end the earth being flat and we need to be lied to and told it's round I don't know who wins out or makes money off of that not really sure then he goes on to say in his lyrics of NASA's under the umbrella of the Department of Defense just think about that one not exactly sure why he thinks that's a smoking gun then we have him mentioning a Mason conspiracy in the lyrics he's really drinking the Illuminati kool-aid here definitely on some New World Order stuff he should have done a feature on the new Megadeth record he would have fit right in there's another moment where he's talking about a court he's fucked do I have a voice do I have a voice then he says he's gonna roll up a joint hey kids listen doing drugs does not necessarily mean you're making good music guess just just pointing it out then he goes on to reference David Irving in the lyrics known conspiracy theorists who thinks like the Jews run the world I mean if I wanted to hear that stuff I would go on the pole board on 4chan and then he mentions that Stalin was worse than Hitler and I mean in a sense he was he killed more people than Hitler but that doesn't make the earth flat and that doesn't make David Irving right it was one thing for b.o.b to be saying the stuff that he was on Twitter about the earth being flat and so on and so forth and a lot of people seem to think that I'm just being mean to him I'm just being a jerk just let him just let him think the earth is flat man just let it with who's he hurting technically he's not hurting anyone directly but clearly this runs much deeper than just the earth being flat for b.o.b you know this this is way more than him just being too dumb to apply the simple reasoning that it would take to realize oh well I don't know can you just dig through the earth I mean you've got money can't you just like travel to the edge of the if you wanted to can't you take a plane to the edge of the earth if you felt like it who lives next to the edge of the earth who's closest to the edge of the earth this is beyond that he clearly thinks there's like you know some crazy conspiracy just like everybody's trying to control his mind and he's just fighting against that Obama is trying to control him the government's trying to control him it's NASA it's the Masons it's the Jews so yeah he's super paranoid and super stupid and then Neil deGrasse Tyson's nephew puts out a response track flat to fact very witty title of course he finds himself over an instrumental that is akin to Drake's back-to-back Tyson brings a flow that is very much like Drake's on that track too he even kind of matches him in references sometimes like with Charlemagne of The Breakfast Club Fame clearly he's borrowing from Drake very heavily on this response track I wonder how much of a rapper he is or how devoted to the game he is because he doesn't really have a strong flow or delivery I mean b.o.b you can't take away that he has at least some style and some attitude Tyson kind of lacks that though I do hear a little bit of care s one in his voice but he doesn't have in style he makes up for in common fucking sense you know all I got to say about this is that night neither check is good just just as like a song I won't be returning to any of these tracks anytime soon however I will say thank God for the internet because if not for the internet our musical celebrities would probably be back in an age where their gatekeepers and there are PR people involved in every facet of their life making sure that they don't make complete idiots of themselves in front of the public and now that we have places like SoundCloud and Twitter people like b.o.b can get on there and say all the dumb shit he wants for our entertainment so again thank God for the internet because it lets people like Bo you just get on a pedestal and just smear shit all over his head as we just have kind of a collective giggle over it so good transition have you given these tracks a listen are you Pro flat earth are you pro spherical earth let me know Anthony Fantana b.o.b Tyson forever 
MYpS04XovqU,uh hey everyone DB tan out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Megadeth album dystopia legendary thrash metal band Megadeth I highly recommend a lot of the records that they dropped in the 80s and 90s a lot of classics in there and they've been at it for decades up until recently actually their last full-length albums supercollider came out in 2013 this is a follow-up to that the album received mixed reviews from fans and I can't exactly say that I think the group is kind of redeeming themselves on this project over here I think they continued to take a turn for the worst on this latest project but in a way I guess not that much worse I mean for one the vocals on this thing Dave Mustaine 'zv ocol 's have been on the downturn for a while now what was once a really menacing scary demonic type growl that you would find on their 80s and 90s material has sort of turned into something that's really goofy awkward and overly campy especially on the spoken word intro the track look who's talking it makes it hard to take anything Dave is saying all that seriously and his vocals I think are so abhorrent a lot of the time that they ruin any melody that they actually try to carry one of the few moments on this thing where I think a vocal chorus actually goes over well is on the title track and that's about it I mean there is a fear cover on the back end of this thing that's semi-decent really after a while the vocals just become unbearable I just think the sound of this record is really flat and really unsatisfying the guitars are thunderously loud just chug chug chug chug some decent riffs here and there some visceral grooves coming out of these guitars but the compression on these guitars is so high and it just kind of sucks the body out of the tone of the guitar so you're just constantly hearing this Vijender than finding it's always the same volume it's always the same intensity it's always kind of the same size there's no real flow or Peaks or values to a lot of the rips on this record the guitar solos are pretty good a lot of the time though very melodic and I wouldn't say the riffs themselves aren't listed well it's just that after a while the vocal and riff combo just get so stale so old just kind of a one-trick pony but if there's something I kind of notices a little different about this record it's that Dave Mustaine really brings home the theme of this record which you can catch through the title I mean on the lyrics here Dave really paints an image of a post-apocalyptic world a post America world a dystopian world and these kinds of themes of war and death and a new world order nothing all that different from Megadeth but I guess there's always been a wall separating Megadeth's music from the harebrained political rants that Dave might make in between songs in the middle of a live set and and now that wall kind of disappears on this project it's like Dave really gives himself permission to go full Alex Jones on this thing and just deliver to us Infowars the album as Dave sings about just there being no borders and how the world is a spinning disaster and the emperor has no clothes and we see it and not that the world is a great place and that everything that you see and read you can totally want to percent believe I understand Dave's skepticism but the lyrics on this record don't even border I mean they really pass into awkwardly paranoid territory cringe fully paranoid territory I would say combine this with the goofy raspy vocal delivery and the robotic Lee chugging guitar riffs that run throughout the entire record I did not care for this thing there really wasn't much in terms of an entire song on this record that I thought was phenomenal I mean each track just kind of ranged from either being bearable to various shades of dislike ability whether it be due to the lyrics or just the one-dimensional guitars Oh vocal moments like you arts I'm kind of superstar the vocals are just so clumsy and awkward and all over the place on this thing yeah I'm feeling a strong for tool like five on this album Tran mission have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would write it what do you think I should review next smash that like leave a comment and have a nice day and eat some fruits and vegetables and drink some water make sure you're hydrated and wear gloves if you go outside it might be chilly out there and don't get affected by this crazy mosquito virus it's crazy forever 
Qx7TFoR8UD8,"ah hey everyone Anthony fan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for a review of this new McLemore single white privilege part 2 McLemore a Seattle rapper and he is slated to release a new full-length album this year with his star producer Ryan Lewis he has dropped a few singles over the past year or so they seem to be doing well I especially like that downtown single but if there's something I've kind of noticed about these recent tracks from Mac it's that they're not really taking the socially aware angle that he's come to be known for however that seems a change on this new song over here and on this track Macklemore is actually returning to a topic that he addressed back about 10 years ago on his debut full-length album Mac Lamar seemed to be on this topic before it became this hot-button buzzword in the social justice community and kind of the irony of that is it seems like the social justice community has more disdain for him than about anybody and a lot of people have charged him with exploiting social movements for money rather than kind of helping and celebrating social movements through his music with these hit songs as much as I see both sides of the argument here I have to kind of say it's a bit of a catch-22 you're sort of damned if you do and damned if you don't the public will cry out if they don't get enough political and socially aware music our music is just drugs and sex and hedonism in bababababa but when we do get socially aware music we just kind of crap all over it or we get bored with it and when it comes to the the comments section of this song on YouTube uh you know let's just say it's it's not exactly harmonious but I guess what you can say about Macklemore is that with this track he's putting out ideas he's starting a conversation in a way now there are a lot of topics being addressed in this 8 minute song when it comes to the smorgasbord of racial and social issues America is facing today I wouldn't say Macklemore solves any of it but he just kind of lays it all out there through a series of chapters this story song starting with Macklemore at a black lives matter protest he's kind of standing on the sidelines wondering how can I get involved how can I help then we go from Mac more to like a loud argumentative sound collage we get in the face of a protester who essentially charges Macklemore with a lot of accusations comparing him to other artists who have appropriated black culture for either shock value or titillation people like Iggy Azalea or Miley Cyrus and then it seems like Mack more Ducks away from the protest he goes into a restaurant or something and he has a one-on-one with a mom like a white suburban mom who really loves his music thinks it's catchy thinks it's positive lets her kids listen to it and everything you sing about like love is totally great but all these people protesting outside that's totally silly because if you run away from a cop you should be shot so Macklemore putting the effect of his own music in perspective seeing that it's not actually having an impact or influencing anything that's actually going on outside in terms of black lives matter and the people who it should be impacting and should be getting to change their minds and actually have a moment of introspection on these issues they're actually just kind of seeing his music is just sort of fun positive pop rap that isn't really you know kind of facilitating any real discussion on issues then after all this there's a bit of a conclusion where McLemore talks about how in the hip-hop game he was steps ahead to begin with because he was white we get a series of quotes from people talking about injustice a house on fire analogy to sort of explain the purpose of black lives matter Macklemore gives his own take on a lot of these issues and the track kind of closes with a melodic outro saying that silence is not a luxury that hip-hop is not a luxury I think basically communicating directly to macklemore's white audience that if they're going to enjoy hip-hop they just can't do it casually or on the sidelines of these social movements that are supposed to lift up black people socially and economically now generally I like the track but I do have my reservations with it I guess I should say that a song like this being made by an artist with a high profile a profile as high as macklemore's is a good thing whether that artist is black or white and we need more artists in the limelight taking issues like these head-on but if we're going to act like this track and McLemore kind of doing all of us a service by addressing this issue then we'll we need to judge it based upon its effectiveness and I don't think this song is going to have much play going deeper into 2016 because it's so obtuse it's so long why is it not crafted like a radio smash like macklemore's previous tracks have been they're going to be a lot of people tuning out of this track at around the 1 minute and 30 or the 2 minute market it's not necessarily going to be because of what Macklemore is saying musically I think this thing is just kind of an eight-minute hodgepodge I think the idea of doing a story track and moving from one voice and one mind to another was really ambitious and cool I mean I I do like those kinds of heady conceptual song topics but I don't think someone who like me is aware of a lot of the issues being discussed in this song is necessarily the audience for this track the fact of the matter is this thing as a song you know it's not a 10,000 word dissertation on the current social climate in America in regards to race url' issues it's a song it's not going to fix any problems it's not going to give us a silver bullet solution to any of these issues and while he does seem aware of that in order to complete this song in a timely manner or a sort of timely manner I think Macklemore has to come to a series of rushed conclusions and ideas to sort of connect the dots Macklemore is obviously an outsider to a lot of the issues he's addressing on this track he's obviously not suffering directly from any oppression that he's rapping about or causing any oppression directly that he's rapping about but he's so eager for the issues that he's addressing on this thing to be his cross to bear he's really trying to carry a burden on this track and it feels kind of like he's lying and not in a way that's intentionally nefarious or deceptive just kind of this lie that we tell to ourselves sometimes we see injustice going on in the world to convince ourselves that we're not a part of that we're not a part of the problem we're not contributing to issue X what he portrays accurately I think is the emotional struggle of the white hip-hop listener who is aware of movements like black lives matter in the issues they're trying to address but doesn't want to just blatantly insert themselves into black struggles it's a real concern that causes real legitimate hesitation but the moment where Macklemore is talking about what these people could be doing to help what if I start a dialogue what if I read an article that line was like Hopsin levels of corny and out of touch miss are you serious what if I read an article like you read an article and everybody's just less oppressed that day though I do understand that these are the baby steps that some Macklemore fans might need to take I can at least give him credit for knowing that he has a large mainstream audience who might be deaf to a lot of these issues and this is Macklemore sort of talking to them on their terms however this track does lack the musical hit appeal that I think a song like this could have used even if it is difficult to condense these issues down into a radio ready track and then there's something about this song that kind of reminds me of the Kendrick Lamar Grammy debacle where Macklemore was so quick to apologize for winning the award and saying that he should have won it again this issue is not McLemore cross to bear and just desperately prostrating himself in song while a lot of people might feel good about that because it does blow off some short-term steam and make a lot of people think yeah that's how I feel too it's not gonna solve any long-term goals because if we totally erase McLemore from the equation and we prevent him from becoming famous and and you know thrift shop never happened and the heist never happened and all that stuff all the issues Macklemore dresses on this track they're still here they still exist and that because these issues are much larger than Macklemore and sit squarely on the shoulders of our politicians of our police force of the drug war of our prison system of our court system and even if it is artful with some very tasteful bits of instrumentation hanging in the background I can't help but feel it a little silly as I'm listening to McLemore on this track just effectively going I'm sorry I'm sorry but you know that's that's basically how I feel about this track again don't doubt his concern and I think it's a heartfelt track dealing with some very difficult issues that again Macklemore alone doesn't have the solution to and probably cannot solve even with his celebrity status but at least this track is again a conversation starter in a sense tramps did you give this track oh listen he loved it did you hate it and what did you think of the philosophy of the song what was said in the track did it hit you emotionally did it make you contemplate some stuff did it make you think twice about some social issues let me know Anthony Fantana Macklemore forever "

is is is D is are the I've heard some good things about this record yeah behind the scenes so they might win me over on this one that's that's what I'm hoping for also the new Animal Collective record painting with I'm pretty psyched for Animal Collective could come through with a great follow up to their last album and the new Matt mos album ultimate care 2 will be dropping even though I'm not in love with a lot of records from their discography they're always doing something abstract with electronic music so it's it's at least worth checking out Kendrick Lamar Jake Cole collaborative album 2016 we need it let's go the new wild nothing album I am looking forward to because I need some more dream pop in my life and also Macklemore and Ryan Lewis new Macklemore and Ryan Lewis record a lot of people mad at me for not hating on their last album but you know whatever I'm looking forward to this new one liked the last single with the dude from foxy Shazam I thought it was a good single downtown could be a good pop rap album Big Ups the new Big Ups record I'm looking for some noisy hardcore punk this year and I hope that Big Ups record brings it new M ward record this year to look forward to new Violent Femmes record to look forward to this year new explosions in the sky record to look forward to this year new black mountain-- record to look forward to this year for your into some older style rock I don't know if the band is going to go back to their prager sound on this project I hope so looking forward to the new Mogwai record atomic also the new Flatbush zombies album 3001 a laced Odyssey should be pretty good famed producer rjd2 should be coming out with something in the first half of this year as well if you're a post-punk fan if you're an alternative dance fan then I would scope out the upcoming primal scream album chaos Moses Yeasayer has a new record coming down the pipe titled Amon and goodbye and three of my most anticipated records of this year Weezer white album the new PJ Harvey record I need a new PJ Harvey record in my life and the next woods album woods another band that puts out a lot of material not in love with all of it but at least they do something kind of interesting and sort of emotionally moving for me so I'm looking forward to what they're gonna do on this project especially a long title on this one so maybe they're gonna change it up musically weird assumption based on the title I know okay so then after that we have a bunch of records from artists who they should be dropping something this year it hasn't been officially titled or a date thrown on any of these records or at least at the time that I was looking up some of these artists hoping to hear something new from allas glass and crystal castle since I know that they are separated also bec and bonobo and Bibby Oh P Diddy has a record coming out this year apparently it's supposed to be like his last record it might be worth a laugh just to check it out Meek Mill maybe he'll drop something this year to kind of you know keep his 2016 hot even though he had a rough 2015 Drake Drake has views from the six dropping he's keeping us in the dark a little bit not exactly sure when exactly it's gonna happen happen happen new Deftones should be coming out this year Frank Ocean where is Frank Ocean where's the Frank Ocean album where's the album Frank was supposed to come out in 2015 where's the record dude Damon Albarn from what I understand is reconvening with gorillas or you know sort of getting the band as it were back together with gorillas and should be dropping some of them this year I hope also James Murphy as you may already know has brought back LCD Soundsystem so there will be a new LCD soundsystem and help them this year new GZA album maybe Liquid Swords part two new Iggy Azalea album could be worth a chuckle new James Blake album that could be good new mi a album okay I didn't think it was a good new hiam album I like hi I'm new flume album Australian electronic music producer haven't loved his previous stuff but maybe he'll blow me away on this new record new Sun Kil moon or mark kozilek record seems like the cause is getting more and more prolific these days and any solo material he puts out this year might be of interest to me also the new Josh Homme II Iggy Pop collaborative album should be interesting the track that they dropped teasing toward the release of this album sounded a lot like the idiot era Iggy Pop and I do like that era of Iggy Pop's music so maybe it'll kind of be a reincarnation of that with maybe some heavier guitars considering josh is in the picture and there should be a new Radiohead record this year we new radio a car - yeah and um I don't know what else to say other than that I mean I'm sure there are tons of records that you're anticipating you guys collectively as the audience that I did not put on my list if you are anticipating some records that not make it onto this list because I'm not claiming to be this all perfect being that knows what's in the future and has every single album that's going to be released this year memorize in my head so what I'm saying to you is the records that you're anticipating this year no doubt in the comments that way we can keep these suggestions the conversation going and us collectively as the people who watch this channel can sort of be on the lookout for what's dropping this year be on the lookout for each other make sure we're well aware of the good music that's gonna be dropping oh damn damn damn bottomless pit bottomless

needle drop podcast and in this episode we're going to be discussing a pretty important topic to me and maybe a lot of you given that you watch so many of my reviews music writing think pieces in the modern age especially in relation to the modern political landscape the social justice landscape there's a fantastic piece on the tiny mixtapes website right now written by writers Patrick bean and Nick Scavo it's a 2015 identity crisis that's the title of it correct guys yes yes and we're gonna be discussing this article I have linked it down there in the description box I've also linked Nick and Pat's respective Twitter accounts and their writer profiles on tiny mixtapes I definitely recommend that you check the piece out we're going to be talking about the albums that they bring up and then just kind of music and and writing that takes more of a social slant in this episode guys thanks for coming on absolutely thank you you guys opened the whole piece up with a pretty bold statement the idea that music criticism is hopeless and I'm just kind of wondering if you would explain on that a little bit further I mean is is the situation as dire as you sort of seem to portray well it's I think it's it's them might be a little bit harsh because ultimately in the end of the piece we argue that it's essential so we're kind of I mean saying that it's hopeless is true in a way and I think we kind of go through that a bit in the piece but ultimately hopefully we're like affirming that it's essential at the same time with it what do you think Pat yeah I mean I know it's you know essential to the entire I mean process of listening at this point I guess hopeless to me in that sense just me it's more there's not necessarily like an aspirational bent to discussing music and that politics have kind of infiltrated these Accrediting he's a criticism so the issue to you as sort of people aren't reviewing music for the sake of reviewing music and sharing in that experience it's like they're just kind of partaking in the act of reviewing music to some other end yeah and I guess our primary point where that the end ultimately what we're seeing more and more of that end is an economic end it's an attention-grabbing end it's something that's that's desiring a clarity in music that doesn't really exist maybe it's it's wanting to kind of say what music is for people as opposed to saying what the music is with the actual music in conversation with the music and and that's sort of a Curtis a criticism that you guys bring up the idea that music criticism exists for the purpose of kind of explaining the art to the listener speaking on behalf of the art is that something that though you think is kind of a baseline characteristic a necessity for music criticism though or is that something that music writers should be trying to evolve past or just move beyond like that's that's the littlest you should be doing as a music writer you should be more ambitious trying to do more uh I think I mean a huge amount of music criticisms readership is looking for just descriptions of music and like insights into you know sound just like things to latch on to but I earlier when I said that politics is infiltrated music writing I guess that's a little bit misleading because I mean music exists within the political like no matter what it's always already there so I think music writing should reflect that but not only to those and so yeah it should evolve beyond just description and what exactly should music writers be trying to incorporate into their reviews other than just kind of simply descriptions of what's going on in the music I mean I think it's essential to add other things you know maybe your emotional take on it or something like that but I think as people sort of look at something as social and cultural as music it's kind of tempting to throw whatever album they're reviewing into the context of whatever's going on currently in the political sphere or in the social sphere yeah and I think that what is essential for music criticism is a is a self-criticism as well and an acknowledgement of music criticisms inherent subjectivity which i think is what think pieces or what a lot of kind of more recent music criticism as has not considered is that the fact that it is a kind of subjective experience of one mind listening to this music and I think that allows to give room for more emotional takes more like experiential takes regarding that music you're allowed to get away with more interesting kind of insights to it because it's your personal insights with it and other people can either agree or disagree or share and you're kind of like value production of that music but I guess what we were critiquing with this piece is what is making off to be an objective kind of statement about whatever moment is happening and to encapsulate that moment and not necessarily consider the more subtle interactions that are at play I guess are you saying that there's kind of this rampant illusion of objectivity going on right now that either the readers are putting on to the music criticism and the think pieces or is it that the writers are going into it assuming that everything that they're saying is sort of doctrine in a way I mean I agree with you that music criticism is a very subjective thing and if that subjectivity that I don't think it can ever get rid of and and if you were to do a completely objective review I don't think the audience would truly want that anyway since it would just kind of be very bland playing descriptions of whatever you're listening to as accurate as possible I think the listeners are kind of looking for a description of the emotional experience of the record and that's incredibly subjective so so while that's that's something that subjectivity is never going to go away as long as there's at least some kind of entertainment or quality level to reviews and we don't go so hard line to the objectivity direction I think writers should at least strive to attain at least some level of objectivity you know it's kind of like a bit of a pipe dream a level of perfection that's never going to be there if it was attained it would probably ruin the art form on the whole but I think it's something that should at least be considered and always be in the back of your mind as you're writing something I just I think a like a sort of disassociative critical objectivity this impossible and I mean I'd be remiss to say that I mean it should be striven for at all like my favorite music reviews are prayers hmm found by Max powdery I think that his Sufjan review is beautiful yeah and I like to think I definitely have come across other music writers who have completely given up on any sense of kind of objective or speaking for the work I mean half the time I've seen some reviews that don't even mention anything about the music it's just something insane kind of like gone experience that somebody had with the music and I but I guess what I was saying earlier about like that objectivity element I think it's more of a lack of self-criticism of like maybe a sense of FAL ability in criticism or that's happening specifically with Fink pieces is that maybe they're not I mean it's obvious that they're not attempting to be objective per se because the opinion the opinionated nature of it is kind of assumed if you're reading a think piece its editorial there's someone speaking their opinion it's assumed to be a subjective take but I guess like the publishing cycle of these things and the kind of like historical kind of proliferation of them like every moment has to have one of these things being published I think that that gives it an almost historical drive to seem objective even if it's not in voice it just seems that these things are just telling us what culture is what it's doing at all moments and it's not self critical enough to allow for a space for us to question the potential nuance of those moments I guess so is that I I guess is the issue that culture and and sort of a certain political slant and ideology is being inserted into music reviews or is it that it's not being inserted into it well or in an objective or a tasteful way you know because I noticed there aren't a whole lot of I guess sort of you know blatant example sort of thrown into the piece of specific reviews and maybe it's just kind of for lack of want to you know shake the rattle indicators are just kind of rock the boat or anything like that but yeah you know I could I could think specifically of you know since since were on this subject already there was that run the jewels review of run the jewels to the tiny mixtapes had put up that delays and that basically just kind of you know threw the album into a corner and just completely categorized it as sexist and really didn't explore it any further than that mm-hmm yeah I mean that I don't necessarily have a problem with with someone wanting to insert like political or cultural context into music writing and if that's all that someone does I mean yeah it is limiting to an maybe but at the same time I guess like the piece is describing like how that is essential to do I think that especially music music is coming out of those political circumstances and a lot of the music that we talked about in the piece certainly does and it's kind of mired or responding to or involved in those contexts but I guess the issue that we had was when pieces kind of try and say what exactly that is for the music and kind of like haphazardly or sloppily create an opinion for the music and ultimately misrepresent the music or at least the fragmented qualities of the music yes I suppose that can be an issue you know I mean I've read tons of opinions about records that obviously take some kind of political slant or make a social comment or some of some kind and it's it seems the more popular the record is the more chances there are for that message to be kind of either misconstrued or misunderstood or misrepresented in some kind of major way I mean certainly the biggest example of that this past year was definitely Kendrick Lamar's latest record an album that people either sort of saw it as this record that limp-wristed white liberals enjoyed because it made them feel good that they were listening to I don't know some black person's experience or there was kind of this response from the other side of the fence where I saw people kind of charging the record with this claim that it's not political or controversial enough since it's not pissing anyone off or making some kind of big grand statement and for me I mean I think it's so rare that we get an album that's so popular and is making at least a couple political statements and I feel like some people some people some listeners sort of took the few moments where it felt like a strong social statement was being made and carried it on to the rest of the tracks which are really more personal in tone and weren't trying to you know sort of take it to the man or anything like that so as a result I think you know as albums that take certain stances get more popular inevitably there's going to be these kinds of misunderstandings and and horrible reviews as well that are just you know completely missed representative of what went on on the record in terms of its message yeah absolutely I I mean there's gonna be an impulse to like have a reactive astir like highly like sensationalize political take on an album that huge and especially when it is explicitly dealing with I mean very immediate like problems you know like in the United States and it's I think it's also a it's I don't know there's a problem of like stratified listening where you would try to approach that record solely on aesthetic terms or solely as a political objects I think that's one of the problems I've found in think pieces so we've been talking a lot about reviews let's move over a little bit toward think pieces what one thing I want to define or sort of clear up before we totally make that jump is is is part of the issue being discussed here that the think piece and the review are kind of in this effort to make writing more clickable more controversial more shareable kind of mixing together in this dangerous way not a dangerous way but kind of a in a way that's kind of souring both you know sides of the fence I mean I I would say that like I've seen scores aside you know like some people feel the need to give scores tiny mixtapes the needle drop or two websites that do that and but the more and more I see reviews I think over especially in the past few years the less and less I see those quantifications and then one step further the less and less I've seen even any negative reviews which i think is emblematic of music writers seeing how kind of pointless a negative review is economically because ultimately you're trying to push products you're trying to create controversy unless you it does create a sense of controversy because negative reviews can do that but for the most part they're affirmations of PR and I've seen more and more of that personally in the past few years and I think that's kind of indicative of this wanting to make things clickable wanting to kind of have a certain level of pipe consistently coming across I don't know yeah well I mean yeah that is certainly a I would say an underlying issue to to all of this I mean you know music criticism music reviewing music journalism for a lot of websites has kind of mixed very dangerously with PR to the point where the legs of music journalism the biggest legs out there just kind of an extension of the PR firms and and you know we're just kind of being told positive things about the record just because that's good for the sake of the artist and that's good for the sake of the label that the artist is signed to and that's good for the sake of the PR company that is promoting the artist that's being reviewed it's good for business in general sure yeah I mean that's that's certainly uh I think of I don't know would you guys say that's more of a surface level issue kind of a symptom or sort of the route to a lot of what's being discussed in this article because certainly there is reason to believe that given the the piece does go into a lot of albums and we'll talk about this next that did kind of take in your view political stances of some sort of make some kind of social comment but but many of them sort of fell under the radar due to either maybe a lack of PR or sort of a a lack of a controversial or an obvious social message I mean a music criticism and PR just they're operating within the same apparatus like it's just different applications like it is I mean there's I guess there is a danger to that it's like that a criticism is content marketing native advertising in some senses but has the potential to be more than that when that's just the assumed state of the industry it's I don't know I mean I I agree with that criticism and I agree with a lot of the criticisms you guys were brought up in this piece and and as much as I would like things to be different I sort of feel like there are other branches of journalism where it would seem like objectivity is supposed to be not only attainable but of the utmost importance and even in those spheres it seems like the general public doesn't even care about the truth as much as they care about hearing something that's going to reaffirm how they already feel about I don't know the war on terror or left-wing issues or right-wing issues so on and so forth and if that's the case if that's like persistently the point of view you what hope does music journalism even have you know uh I guess I guess that's my question and you know not necessarily that you guys haven't have an answer you know but but I feel like the only thing I can do is try to do my best understanding that you know even my efforts if I were to try to you know sort of point things out or fix anything it wouldn't necessarily fix anything and it wouldn't necessarily make people care yeah I mean I just realized how cynical I sound I never really feels like in the service of label when I'm writing for sure mm I mean I hope I'm like applying it something I don't know you're cynical piece of shit yeah loosen up guys come on yeah for me I mean like to be totally honest I enjoy most music in general I mean as like kind of you know optimistic and not cynical as that might sound like I think most music has the potential for someone to feel a certain way about and positive things most music maybe even a hundred percent of music is positive to me personally it's an opinion sure but um I think that again like what you're saying about certain things reaffirming ideologies that's the problem I agree I have a problem with that and I think that naturally runs against some of the material optimism and potentiality of music and artistic creation in general and I think think pieces are an exaggerated version of that where they are specifically trying to pin the piece of art or the piece of music against the wall and define it and speak for it in such a way that I think a review doesn't necessarily do I think a review is flawed in a way that's similar to the music whereas a think piece pretends to be a kind of perfect representation of a historical or cultural moment for everybody so okay to sort of further clear out the cynicism a little bit I mean generally I enjoy a lot of the music that comes across my table and and just because something happens to be marketable doesn't necessarily mean it's bad or that it's it's awful I mean we're sort of in an age where something hip creative challenging can in fact be marketable you know that that wasn't as much the case decades and decades ago back before the internet was pretty much the primary route for music discovery for a lot of people and and a lot of the music scenes on the internet sort of operating with these niche sort of characteristics where everybody can kind of go solo do their own thing not really worry about having to appeal to everybody in order to the music and get it out there and when something hip and challenging does end up being marketable and does end up selling a lot of copies I mean that's that's something to celebrate you know that's not necessarily a bad thing I mean it's a let's take this new David Bowie record for example I mean in a lot of respects it's very strange it's totally off-the-wall and it's like on the front page of iTunes you know 10 15 years ago an album this challenging it might not have been the case I mean actually David Bowie did quite a bit of quite a few odd records in the 2000s that you know didn't see quite as much attention as his older work and didn't get quite as much internet buzz and it seems with this new record and even prior to the you know announcement of his death it seemed like there was a really warm reception going on mm-hmm yeah definitely I think that um in desire section of our piece we kind of addressed that with the three artists that being Sophie Carly Rae Jepsen and Grimes and I think Grimes is someone who I happen to really love art angels a lot of people didn't add tiny mixtapes but personally she's someone who's kind of come from this DIY like house show scene and you know like very kind of illegible vocals you know a role in synthesizer and a microphone and ended up making like this incredibly rich lush pop record that's incredibly marketable and you saw the industry grow with her artistic identity and you saw her react to that numerous times throughout her kind of growth as an artist and then on the other side you see someone like Carly Rae Jepsen who is like a pop star and you see a lot of like underground or experimental communities really digging her emotion album I think you're starting to see kind of like the the fluidity between things that were once more socialized or more specific to certain markets well in in regards to the Carly mentioned that up in your piece I I think it has to do with like what you said it seemed like as modern and as new as the record felt it seemed like she was incorporating a lot of older and tried-and-true pop sounds and song stylings in her music which i think made it kind of accessible to an audience that looks for music that has a little bit more depth to it maybe even a hint of nostalgia to it not simply summing not simply something that is the newest loudest biggest most sugary pop song that the major labels can kind of cobble together in the studio mm-hmm for sure and let's also speak to Sophie a little bit since we're in kind of that section of the piece and I want to talk about the music that you guys bring up a little bit more Sophie certainly seems to be in a position where the accessible and the inaccessible the the the I don't know the the weird and the bubblegum the the the type of music that you would find people dancing to in a club are both kind of embraced at the same time and and you feel like some kind of statement is being made vicariously through this I do definitely I mean I think that the fact that it's on McDonald's commercial and know boys heads love it is a testament to its actual quality I think that uh the actual you know we could talk about social implications of it like yeah it's cheesy yeah whatever like you know I'm not necessarily interested in that as much as I'm interested in how amazing it sounds and I think that a lot of people who try and critique Sophie's music fall short because they try and and fit it again in a social framework a soffel framework that's really important to it it's coming out of a kind of a certain context and a certain kind of like identity driven context but the material productions that he's created are so actually amazing in my opinion that it kind of renders those things moved personally I don't know what you think Pat yeah well and I mean what one of the main criticisms like inauthenticity its levied against it which is just as absurd as calling I mean Carly Rae or Grimes and authentic like that they don't understand the conditions into which they're like submitting their creations i I think that inauthenticity sort of criticism do you feel like that partially comes from do you feel like that comes mostly from the music or could it also have something to do with kind of the elusive 'ti of PC music and just kind of that whole brand at large I mean I know a lot of people sort of seemed steamed over the the idea that Sophie would perform live with someone who was kind of dressed in a very feminine manner and sort of saw that has like an exploitation of femininity in some kind of way I mean I think they're pretty as the collective self aware of their aesthetic and just playing with like post-internet identity and I'm I can understand arguments that that's exploitative as well as I can understand arguments that they're playing in like a productive way with identity yeah I don't know if Nick dude yeah I feel like I mean I think some criticisms about them are more warranted than others the one criticism I don't have much patience for regarding criticism of Sophia or PC music is one that just calls them cheesy or they're sound silly or people who just don't like it because of the kind of coolness that surrounds it again this is like a big part of the essay itself is just a reluctance to to accept pieces that attempt to just on a purely cultural level define exactly what something is and I think that is comes from like the the biggest you know music publication that submits this giant pink piece but I also think that's evident in your friend who refuses to step outside of his little or their little bubble regarding their opinions about music and I think that PC music is something that shows that often because yeah and and I don't know could could this off-putting vibe that people have toward some of PC music's output calling it cheesy calling it corny and just leaving it simply at that could that have something to do with I don't know at least to me and I enjoy this there's at least a touch of this is a little tongue-in-cheek or maybe it's a little funny like we're in on the joke there's obviously something kind of silly about what we're doing here but underneath that there's a lot of skill to what's going on in the production and the sound craft and and all of that yeah and and I think consistently over decades and decades and decades people have a hard time sort of appreciating at least even an element of comedy in their music for sure and like yeah to me there's nothing jokey about about PC music or so yeah they're the most like serious artists to me like they're 100% committed to what they do there's never been a point where they've like changed anything about what they've done really it's been like consistently we're doing this and they're doing it really well and I think that shows like a commitment that I think is culturally misunderstood by some people who are feeling like it's this joke or inauthentic thing or whatever but I think it's like really sad if it's like tragic if you have to ironically enjoy PC music or if there has to be that filter to have fun with it I mean you should try and dancing with it the same thing with with Carly Rae yeah a lot of people you know might have picked up on her music and have been enjoying it through an ironic lens like oh wow this is a pop star it's cool to like you know pop in this way again or on the reverse spectrum like I hate Grimes but now I like Grimes because you know this is just a bunch of ridiculous like flip-flopping on that level it's all good like all of them no it's it's it's absolutely true I mean I my review of the new Grimes record was way more positive than I thought it was going to be and pretty consistently I gotten messages just saying like what the hell are you talking about this records trash I can't believe me like it and that came from both people who enjoyed her last record so much and from people who I know personally who have taken kind of a raucous stance on a lot of newer records and you know don't see much merit in what people like Grimes are doing but whatever I guess that's neither here nor there let's um get them to some of the other music that you guys bring up you guys bring up OneNote Rick's point never a record and and you definitely teased some interesting ideas out of sort of the statement being made on the record or what you perceived to be what the album is saying but um you know for me personally a lot of the sounds if I just kind of take them for what they are it just seems so abstract that it's not overtly communicating anything to me other than just really stimulating you know sounds and creative ideas although you know I will say that Daniel most definitely seems to very strangely thrive despite making such left-field music and not really giving in to this trend of just kind of a cult of personality it just kind of seems like so much of the music that comes out now is very heavily personality driven and that's just not really his MO yeah I reviewed Garden of Daliya for tiny mixtapes and kind of went off the deep end with that review so you might see a little bit of that here and then this section of the piece specifically talking about his music but um I guess I was in the review and here I think I am arguing that specifically with garden of delete he is imploding his art in some way or denying himself he spoke a lot about that with the whole Ezra thing and just kind of like damaged quality to his music and I think here I guess we did talk about how it was like almost like a sensational effort on his own part of to like damage his own kind of artistic quality which in turn made it even better it's like the one thing he could do in his own artistic continuum you know you see that kind of- opus and a lot of careers like you have you know the yeezus or the kid a record which is this like you know denial of everything that makes the artist what they are and garden of delete isn't necessarily that but it is that for 100 point ever in my opinion and and however complicated that might be because the context for 100 point never is very complicated aesthetically i guess i mean it's it's it's an album that's certainly explosive like those other records that you sort of bring up at least for him if you're analyzing it within the context of the rest of his discography it does seem kind of dangerous yeah and it's the i feel like it does play with it's the first to play with this cult of personality in some way like acknowledging it's like a claim or the idea that he is this like avant artist and it's like the pr leading up to it the editor interviews does i don't know it toi a lot and i thought yeah just the idea that there's this fake band out there that inspire the music yeah exactly and i think you you know and we were able to kind of write this piece a few months or one month after garden and the lead came out so we kind of got to see how the press handled it and in my opinion it kind of fell into the trap of this like hyper grunge rock band you know like adolescent aesthetic which in my opinion like as nothing to do with the album like i think that you know those are those are all kind of like dressing ups on the album and a lot of the kind of press that surrounded the album involved it being like you know this you know squealing guitar smokes and fire and you know like melting skin and all this stuff but it again it wasn't necessarily analyzing the album outside of the kind of signifiers that were surrounding it which I think were set up so that it would effectively kind of create that PR around it we have for a lot of music writers who tend to sort of be within a few years of how old I am or you are a lot of the things blatantly referenced musically on the record are kind of nostalgic things so as a result I mean of course that stuff would you know sort of bring up ideas and themes of adolescence to the person listening let's talk a little bit about the the new James Ferrara record a record that I I personally didn't really care for but an album that still I do appreciate it for what it seemed like it was trying to say socially however it seems like the record didn't really make that big of a splash and at least the way the piece read to me it was like you guys kind of saw that as a bit of a tragedy either that people either weren't appreciating the music or maybe this the message was kind of lost on them I don't I feel like it wasn't so much like a political failing of like critics to engage with well no maybe it was like it was such as like aesthetic step from NYC hell that I think he was seen as like staying in his own niche and it kept people or critics from really engaging with the statements like very like localized like historic engagement with LA and like a racialized violence in the u.s. in a way that you know people were ready to talk about to pimp a butterfly or one otras point ever no check the exact yeah yeah and my in my opinion for arrow I'm a huge fan so Ferraro can do no wrong in my eyes but I think it's kind of obscurity and it's a you know general yeah like if critics did say that it didn't deviate enough from NYC hell or its to kind of obtuse for them or frankly if they just don't like his voice or they think that what he's doing is like too kitschy I mean he's a he's an artist on his own terms he's working he's kind of in his own lane doing his thing he's been doing his thing and I you're either you either enjoy it or you don't or you're willing to kind of step into his world or you're not and I guess if you do step into it there's a lot of brutal commentary and a lot of incisive commentary and a lot of beautiful commentary inside of it so that's my opinion about the record okay and and I like that you know we're sort of bringing these albums up in this context and it's sort of and could allow for the listeners to maybe go back and listen to some of these records and give them a bit of a different mental angle to sort of dig up what some of these albums are really trying to say and again you know definitely refer to the piece in light of what Nick and Pat are saying about these albums but another record that seemed like it fell underneath even more radars was the new auteur navoo record I mean I didn't care for the record either but it seemed like there was just this huge I guess gap of buzz in between what happened with his last record and what happened with this latest record and to be perfectly honest I wasn't a fan of the last record either so from the standpoint of two guys who have obviously been paying more attention and than me what exactly happened this time around that didn't occur last time around or you know vice versa well it's a hard to pinpoint but I mean I think a large part of the negative reception was just that he's do something I think nobody really expected or wanted to hear from him like age of transparency is just it's it's you know in the same emotional like barrier like raw mode as anxiety are you but it doesn't really have a an angle that's easy to latch on to and if there is an angle it's maybe that one regarding transparency or you know this kind of like mediated authenticity where you know it's it's basically like a meta conversation in a way and I feel like that might take a level of patience that a lot of people don't have for music I mean there's so much music that it is and we're used to a sound I think that the general R&B vocalist thing has become dominant in a way that when anxiety came out it wasn't so people might have like just not felt it because of its context in 2015 this time but I know Pat you really love the record I like it too yeah I mean I'm not necessarily trying to get you guys to boil down what's trying to be said on the record I mean I think kind of the point that you guys brought up and I and I do agree the album doesn't put forward a really kind of boom smacking you over the head with a really obvious idea or point or statement on something so as a result if the listeners have to stick around in order to sort of read into what's being said to sort of understand a really complex issue a really complex statement it's it's not as easy as just kind of getting behind a record that sort of puts out there very plain and simple black and white us versus them mentality or you know just overly simplified views of oppression or whatever is kind of you know sort of the the flavor of the day as far as political views go in a lot of these reviews and in these think pieces that you guys are criticizing earlier in the piece so as a result of that is it kind of harder or less interesting or less I don't know monetarily solvent for some records like this to be reviewed since writers can't sort of pigeonhole them and throw them at listeners at such an angle where they're like hey this records making a really cool statement that you're totally going to agree with because you read that think piece that we wrote last week and it says exactly that yeah exactly and we made it we made a joke about that like at the end of the Ferraro section where you can imagine like a fake headline about Ferrero that's like imagine James Ferrero or like meet James Ferrara the Internet artist turning skid row into sonic fire or something you know like just it just it just seems absurd to do that given the kind of damaged quality of that record and if it was sensationalized the artist would probably hate it as well you know which is another whole issue to bring up it's whether or not artists even want this to happen to their work in the first place I mean is jokey as that headline is I mean that that could be a serious headline on another website and it kind of sounds like you guys should be doing I don't know either running a site or doing some PR where you know you're just you're just throwing all these political angles at writers and telling them what to write about these records yeah and you know in my opinion like someone who writes about current music and music that's just coming out and I'll write a review or well you know have an interview with an artist and really feel for it and I can't help but like feel a sense of like general malaise when I see that article come out in a few weeks later a month later where it's like you know what's happening you know that the apparatus is getting its machine rolling and you see that headline come out about some artists that you're into and I don't think it's a you know it's not inherently a bad thing like it's I'm not trying to have this like punk rock idea where like oh if it gets popular it's bad but like I think we do have to be careful about how and trying to bring this music to a your audience being careful not to let the qualities that made the work what it was get lost in that transition I guess yeah it's it should be stated again popular is not bad it does not necessarily mean mad bad it just seems like what you guys are pretty obviously protesting is the idea of trying to make the music popular trying to give the music buzz off of a bunch of empty political platitudes using think pieces or using reviews yeah it's the sense that a specific like political framework would overwrite like some secret or some like complexity within the art it's like a damaging with viewing a work that like sort of limits its own like subjectivity and life and possibility is food you know a million different experiences and also on the side of criticism it's it's doing the same thing for the writing that's happening about music I would say you get these you get these cookie cutter articles and headlines that you're reading the same article over and over again you know and it's yeah it's just kind of homogenizing in regards to the art and the writing about the art yeah well I think um I unfortunately I think a lot of websites sort of over read one another or maybe just over read the press release that's handed to them along with the artists so as a result you do kind of see a lot of those same phrases popping up again and again and again and again in reviews I mean I know personally I try to avoid any and all reviews when I'm writing a review so I'm not sure how much of you know sort of what I'm saying might be the same exact thing is what other people are saying as well on a lot of these review sites but but the thing is also we're kind of all living and thriving in the same context you know in this music writer world and viewing these albums through as specific as we would like to think our experiences are we're still kind of viewing these albums through a very similar lens it's we've got a crunch out these reviews and a certain amount of time and it's got to be consumable for an audience and there's certain phrases and ways of writing and communicating that are the most effective that we all kind of stick to so as a result I think there are some similarities that are obviously going to pop up in a the writing about some of these records yeah and I think that's okay I don't think it's a it'd be definitely okay if everyone was trying their hardest to write about the music and everyone's reviews ended up the same because they tried so hard to write about it and they got all the ideas really right like that would be amazing I think it's a the kind of competitive idea that has even led itself to this thing Peaks culture the fact that you do have to differentiate yourself from other publications and this kind of competitive environment where everyone's like you have your review has to be written way different as kind of led to just the optimization of that entire situation where people stop doing that and instead do the most efficient thing you know hmm alright um let's finish up by sort of getting into this section of the piece where you guys essentially say the the battle is over while certainly you know you guys do acknowledge music criticism I mean certainly like you said at the beginning of the piece it's hopeless but it's still necessary it's still going to be around even if we were to take some kind of violent action and completely obliterate any and all music press there would still be opinions and and because those opinions can be launched over social media and people tend to congregate toward opinions that they like on social media I mean those individuals are gonna end up having followings just like any music site used to have a file you know prior to their obliteration so you know they're still going to be opinions they're 70 points of view and there's so many people congregating around these points of view so uh even though music criticism is necessary and it's going to be around whether we do something about it or not you know is the future of it kind of dismal and in your point of view I like the sort of democratization of music criticism you just imagined like I'm thinking like yeah a tweet with like the most well each other music critics would argue you know that it already has been democratized heavily I mean certainly it's not you know in that position of perfect democratization but part of the reason a lot of music critics who came up in the 80s and 90s don't have careers anymore is that it's been democratized to the point where their services are no longer you know sort of needed well and so I mean you know we we are talking about at least some democratization I guess is my point you know but uh you know you're talking about democratization and even more extreme sense and I guess like the machines or the the press apparatus has has moved to understanding that democratization where you can pay whoever to write whatever and it will work you know yeah it's like you know Cotton's like just basic content marketing stuff and I guess the think pieces that we're talking about are the kind of content marketing that contains a certain political feeling and it's it's asked like in that last section we do try and not rob it of its potential meaning like we're not just trying to say all think pieces are bad I think Pat mentioned in that last section that there is a hopefulness in Plzen politicized music writing it does kind of allow for conversations to take place and kind of positive arguing and differences of opinion to get fleshed out on social media and blah blah blah but I guess it's the potential replacement of that type of writing and that type of thinking with the actual tools for carrying out a real political optimism with a mere feeling of that political situation I don't know if you want to talk about that more yeah I mean it just I think nothing pieces are endlessly important like to give AAPIs like a platform to oppositional voices is you know minoritized voices like marginalized writing but so often the engagement or like the sharing and everything is just almost exploitative in the sense that it is just it's it's the feeling of like I don't know being engaged or active without any sort of real mobilisation happening yeah yeah I mean it's it seemed like the way that you guys had ended it and you know I think we'll kind of close up here and you know tell me if I'm wrong but uh it seemed like political speech in music writing you know given music writing is so indebted to culture is going to happen and it's necessary but the thing is is that it's important for the quality of that speech and those points of view to be good level-headed and objective and not be informed by this idea that we need to throw these empty political buzzwords and sort of this point of view into the piece because it's going to be more controversial yeah I'm trying to I just yeah and those I'm searching and those I think you're right that that danger is not in the think piece it's in the kind of baiting of culture and the controversial words that are thrown into it and the kind of like self pleasing quality that happens when something is sensational eyes to the point of and that's at the subtitle of the piece is listening for identity in a sensational vacuum and just kind of like the relentless sensational political atmosphere that you feel when you're scrolling through anything and to actually hear an artist's identity in that kind of noise and if you can hear it at all alright I want to thank you guys for coming on and talking with me about the piece again I'm gonna link this piece down there in the description so you guys can read it yourselves and I just appreciate you guys having a conversation all about this stuff and what you read absolutely thanks for having you 
wzI3LfeUGRw,hey everyone don't fit in touched a note here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new savages album adore life this is the sophomore full-length album from this UK post-punk outfit I enjoyed their debut full-length LP silence yourself quite a bit one of my favorite albums of the year it dropped I believe the song shut up was my favourite rock song of that year to listen long ago and heard it especially if you're into you know Siouxsie and the Banshees Joy Division that kind of stuff I also caught them in New York City this past year where they played a live show where they actually incorporated a lot of material from this new full-length album live it sounded fantastic so of course I was excited to give a listen to this album definitely one of my most anticipated albums of 2016 and I'm sure there are plenty of records that you guys have anticipated too in the past but have you ever given a listen to a record you were anticipating and it felt like everything that generally made the artists good was there but just something was missing look because that's just really how I feel here on paper it would seem that much of what made savages debut records so great carried over onto this project the driving bass lines the reverb soaked atmosphere guitars Jenny Beth's very emotive expressive vibrato but it's not all coming together to create the same menacing powerful atmosphere that silence yourself had on so many cuts this album does not feel as big or as pummeling or as immense tracks like shut up in husbands where your shatteringly loud at points and perform with some serious guts even on similarly aggressive cuts like on this is what you get which has speedy drums speedy bass line and Jenny Beth on top her vocals seem kind of claustrophobic like they're not really in the mix not really soaked in reverb like much of the instrumentation is not really howling or wailing with the intensity her vocals usually do they're kind of reserved in comparison with other vocal performances even on this record I like the bitter angle at love that the lyrics on the song takes but I'm not getting that pent-up rage that obviously fueled the writing of these lyrics I kind of feel the same way with the song sad person which again some decent drums and bass on this thing not a bad song concept in terms of the lyrical content here but it seems like Jenny Beth is holding back once again not really letting loose on whoever she had in mind when she strung these words together I'm not really getting the idea that she's singing about this hateable horrible sad detestable person the ending on this track was really explosive though I did like that but still it's it's it's a shame to hear these tracks which at their core may be written pretty decently sounding kind of flaccid on record especially since when I heard them why they were huge they were explosive they were as explosive as the older material so this lowering of the energy seems like a change of pace that isn't serving this album very well however if there is a plus side a change of pace that did work in favor of some of these tracks savages incorporates a little more vocal melody on these tracks especially on the intro song here really odd vocal line flying over this whirlwind of guitars and snares and cymbals it's total chaos and just a big bang of an intro track there was a touch of extra vocal melody on the song sad person as well that I liked but as far as the slower subtler quieter tracks ago they weren't really the showstoppers on the band's last full-length LP that they were definitely the Achilles heel in a sense though I didn't think they were that bad however they've gotten even worse here like on the song adore which is anything but riveting except for the end which is actually pretty explosive has a nice crescendo there's actually quite a few moments on this record where the verses the chorus is pretty much everything leading up to the huge just monstrous ending will be kind of drab and then there's the track slowing down the world which has a decent drum and bass groove but if the band was trying to put a lull in the middle this record they did it especially with the flaccid hook which does not contrast well out of the verses and the guitar leads on this thing seem really awkward kind of like they just don't know where to really insert themselves also the case on when in love which if you listen to the guitar leads on the intro and the chorus here probably the most awkward guitar leads you're gonna hear all year does not complement the melody or the groove of what's going on in the background at all there are moments on this LP where it feels like the drums the guitar is the bass they're all playing at the same tempo but nobody's complementing each other playing off of one another everybody's just kind of doing their own thing and just making sure that it's all on the same key by the time the song I need something new rolls into the tracklist I'm feeling a similar frustration the track is loud it's hard hitting but it's not really the refreshing change of pace that I was hoping for at this point in the record though I do like the song of surrender a lot it's one of the better melodic cuts on here and even though it is loud I think it could be toned down into a decent ballad as well I love the way Jenny Beth's vocals just kind of call out very evocative Lee and very dramatically serrano on the chorus here feels really big feels really dramatic after that the record closes out with an indulgent five minute finisher which maybe would have been more palatable if all the songs preceding this track had been a little bit catchy err more exciting more interesting there were a handful of tracks on this LP that I liked and I appreciate the savages put together yet another no BS record and just gave us the 10 tracks and ducked out but I feel like the band on this one handed us very roughly the same album over again but just not quite as good the quality gap between these two records was pretty obvious and a lot of the time it comes down to individual tracks the writing isn't really as fantastic not as catchy and the performances which if you're a punk band I don't really think you could skimp out on a band that relies on just a visceral sound an explosive sound the performance is a lot of the time are kind of flaccid just not as intense nor is the sound as intense as what savages have delivered in the past some of the risks that the band took with melody served themselves as well but outside of that there just wasn't really enough to sort of change things up and and just make the band's sound come off fresh again I'm feeling a light six on this LP transition have you given the striker to listen if you did did you enjoy it more than me if you did that's totally cool what did you like about the record what did you dislike about the record I hope you have a good one I'm sorry forever 
YFQvT0-mefs,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new daughter record not to disappear this is the second full-length album on 4ad records by this uk-based trio I was enticed by a few teaser tracks from this album surprisingly I didn't even remember the buzz surrounding their last full-length record the music seemed really Moody I occasionally like very moody music and I just went into this thing wondering if the band was going to put out a good follow up to the relatively buzzy debut album they dropped and I was just pretty disappointed in what I heard here it's another indie flavoured album with a breathy vocalist who has about as much personality as a blank sheet of paper and she's wrapped up in all this rock instrumentation that's super slow super syrupy and sort of tracked on to this digital playing field that's kind of cheaply sewn together and it's just like a bunch of post rock cliches just one after another very cut-rate and doesn't even sound that good especially during the very chaotic and brittle and unpleasant crescendos on tracks like fossa and the song how and the songwriting generally is so slow it's so uneventful it's so meatless it's almost like it's trying to prove something by doing so little that there's almost nothing to engage with it's almost as if the band is trying to get away with putting so few compelling moments into these songs just up until the point where you go hey I don't even like this it's like the group is just trying to hand you sadness on a silver platter really beat you over the head with it much in the way I thought foxing was on their last full-length album and the music here is depressing but only because the vocal performances the guitar work and the songwriting are just desert wastelands respectively just so few compelling ideas that I feel like I'm dying of thirst by the fifth track there's just this slowly intensifying torture to listening to this thing like it doesn't want it to be over depressing music shouldn't simply be music that lacks excitement or happiness that's not sad that's just mediocre this is like top tier emotional sterility one of the few bright spots on this record is the song no care and the driving drums and guitars actually bring a bit of urgency to frontwoman Elena's vocals though I wouldn't really say the lyrics are all that inspiring or interesting she reads to me like one of many very moody female singer-songwriters from the 90s but she doesn't exactly have the lyrical detail or the personal turmoil to really sell what she's singing there aren't really many nice things I could say about this record honestly like the mixing is subpar the songwriting is subpar the instrumental performances are subpar the vocals occasionally are kind of Pleasant I mean they're not horrible to listen to but the thing is they're they're not engaging they're not intriguing trying to pick up a compelling emotional cue from this record is like trying to pick up a signal from a broken Wi-Fi tower on your smartphone I'm feeling a decent two strong three on this thing transition have you given this album a listen if you have what you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana reviews forever 
3lTOkT7BaD4,hmm hey everyone today Santa here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the New Sun Kil moon and Jesu Yaesu collaborative record this is a collaborative musical album featuring singer-songwriter mark kozilek of Sun Kil moon and Red House Painters Fame teaming up with Justin Broderick multi-instrumentalist producer who you might know from the plethora of musical projects he's been in most notably God flesh which he recently resurrected came out with a new full-length God flesh album God flesh actually got a lyrical nod on Sun Kil moons last full-length album on the track possum it is I believe and I'm guessing going to that live show seeing God flesh interacting with Justin mentioning that in that possum track was sort of the link that created this collaborative project over here now part of me is saddened that this link that this interaction didn't result in a new God flesh album where Mark kozilek is just screaming in horror over every single track but I guess we got the next best thing here we have Broderick tossing kozilek on top of the very slow heavy dreamy rock instrumentation of one of his other very notable projects yaesu which in a sense kind of worries me because in my opinion the latest material from yaesu like the past three or four albums haven't exactly been that great not only have the riffs and the songwriting been super stale but the sound play is kind of surface level too I mean I don't really care for the really brittle distortion combined with the very heavy heavy sub bass on these guitars honestly and this is the case for this new album over here I find some of the heavier guitar tones on this thing kind of migraine inducing especially on the second track here where the riffs are so redundant that it's almost like there's no end unfortunately the first several tracks on this thing sort of seems like Justin and Mark putting together their respective aisles in the most plain uninspired and most obvious way possible I mean I wouldn't want to listen to these super heavy flavorless shoegaze II metal instrumentals on their own and mark kozilek doesn't exactly sweeten the deal especially since on these first several cuts he's nearly drowned out by a lot of the guitars his very soft muttered meandering musings on everyday life don't exactly slice through the blaring wall of distorted guitars which was also kind of an issue for me on some of the more aggressive cuts from Marc's last album universal themes except exacerbated lyrically though from what I can tell on this project mark does seem a little more organized focusing on topics and moments in his life recently that he's really passionate about rather than just kind of packing these tracks with just everyday my new show just to kind of come through with this long-winded concept of course I'm talking about how universal themes quite literally in its lyrics try to universally encompass so many things but even without mark forcefully trying to sing about every single thing that happens to him on this record his music has most definitely been more personal lately as noted in a letter that mark reads in the midst of one of the tracks on this project on the song last night I rocked the room like Elvis and the letter does read a lot like pandering the the writer of the letter pandering to mark mark kind of pandering to himself but it was interesting hearing mark moved by the words of a listener sort of laughing as some of the things that the listener said like how Benjy is just kind of for the hipsters and how these latest albums are for the real fans who have been listening for the past 20 years and how mark is sort of attacked so just unrelentingly in the press the music press who are just kind of looking for some drama he actually reads another letter which I enjoy a little bit more on the song America's Most Wanted later on the record and there's actually a funny moment on this last night I rocked the room track where he says that he's giving the the writer of the letter co-songwriter credit since he did read the whole letter in this track as you can see the lyrics on this thing super meta and if you haven't been following the drama that Mark kozilek has been embroiled in since the release of Benjy then much of what is sung about on this record might sort of fly over your head but I'm not gonna say it's not compelling because Marc's vocal delivery his personality his lyrics are so good that it might intrigue you enough to actually look into what exactly he's singing about I think a lot of the detours and the stories on this project are just more compelling than they are aimless as Mark sings about tales from his tour or a moment where used poking fun at a fan who I guess is messaging him asking him for a red vinyl or rare collector's vinyl or something like that we have Mark revisiting the themes of family and death on the song Father's Day and the track Exodus which is related to the recent passing of Nick Cave son is the definition of touching through this catalyst of a situation Mark explores the pain of losing your child and it's worth noting that most of the instrumentals on this project don't go in this heavy blaring Shuhei z-direction that I really do not enjoy and the song Sally which is the only track after the first three songs that returns to that latter loss I find Mark's delivery over this track his rage on the song to be kind of invigorating so there are sounds on this project other than blaring guitars I mean the track last night goes in more of an electronic direction as a couple tracks and the track listing here do it sort of reminds me of what Mark was doing with jimmy lavalle a valley from the album leaf on their collaborative album from 2013 and the all acoustic cut fragile Reed's a lot like a song that could have been straight off of Benjy musically and lyrically as Mark tells us how upset he was over the death of yeses Chris Squire and sort of relates his passing in his battle with leukemia to a childhood friend who was also named Chris who was bad with the same disease my favorite cuts on this project are toward the end really America's Most Wanted is definitely one my favorite tracks here and I think brings a sound to the table I wish more tracks on this record did it has propulsive rhythms it has electric guitars but they don't overdo it this level of volume and intensity seems like the perfect backdrop the perfect foundation for mark I actually think it gives what mark says on this track a level of urgency as he's kind of telling this tale from tour throwing in some musical references and some news items it seems almost as if mark has a foot in the world and a foot outside of the world he's connected through news and through information but simultaneously he's outside of that world on tour connecting with people face to face performing for audiences and it kind of seems like in that world which in a sense might be the real really real world I guess this song just kind of gives you a an interesting perspective on touring and traveling juxtaposed against just the general vision and information that your average person is handed every day about the world that they're living in or at least that's how I interpreted it you know I feel like this song could be interpreted in a myriad of different ways I love the song Exodus again really powerful tracks and the most powerful lyrics on the entire record and the closing track here beautiful.you is a nice little ambient piece very electronic very Spacey very vast and Mark kind of does a little bit of a spoken-word thing over it going more in detail into the minutiae of his life but in a way where his introspective thoughts are actually kind of moving and thought-provoking even a moment when he decides to sort of go in the ocean take a chance waters cold and and a wave kind of rushes up and hits him and freezes his balls it's it's funny and it's thoughtful at the same time you know mark is a thought-provoking guy and he's a guy who obsesses over the little things it would seem and he's got a good sense of humor too and all that comes through on this project I just wish some of the instrumentals especially those first three were better and that mark and Justin sort of took this opportunity to I don't know come together with either a sound unique to this collaboration or just come together with the sound that was more complementary to what Mark was doing especially since Mark's vocals and Mark's stories seemed to kind of be leading the way on this thing prime example of that happening America's Most Wanted prime example of that not happening the first three tracks I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition your give it a listen to this album if you have what do you think about it do you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next should you burn a copy of this album pass it over to your mom let me know Anthony Fantana Sun Kil moon issue forever 
Kr_akDq7CMY,hey everyone west coast tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new Andersen PAC album Malibu Anderson pack west coast singer and songwriter producer and he's been making quite a splash lately lending his very passionate raspy dynamic vocals to projects both big and small dr. Dre's latest album slash soundtrack as well as even the new bus driver mixtape and given all of this newfound attention of course this latest project of his is is going to be a breakthrough for him at least on some level and you cannot say that Anderson not tried to do it big on this thing given that he's handed over an hour of material 16 tracks on this thing with features from Rhapsody the game schoolboy q as well as bj the chicago kid Talib Kweli and more and on this project pac sounds deeply influenced by the institutions of funk jazz hip hop pop R&B all of which kind of blends together into a very smooth neo soul flavor some of the time and there's a lot of that kind of stuff to go around these days however many of these new faces aren't paired with very strong voices unfortunately but the vocal performances here are actually really good but I sort of knew that was going to be the case going into it given how many great vocal features Anderson has laid down in the past the singing on this thing it's full of emotion it's got a lot of charisma swagger occasionally it's seductive he's far from sloppy and I would say anything but boring and the 16 tracks on this thing are somewhat diverse as well as Anderson and his producers kind of hopped from one genre to the next I love the glossy futuristic funk grooves on the song am I wrong feels very new feels very modern but then on cuts like put me through and celebrate even though the production here is pretty fresh it's pretty clean that the core of these tracks there's like a class 6ol single and anderson dips into rapping as well on this thing over a couple of beats that are very jazzy fractured produced by 9th wonder specifically on the song without you on this track not only are the verses very fun very entertaining but anderson brings his own chorus too so of course that's good because you know he can sing and given that there a few tracks on here he produces he's just like a triple threat on this thing and then there's the very lovely and alluring song room in here which is probably the sexiest track on the entire record the chorus vocals on here like a hot breathy whisper in the ear which is set against these very grand piano loops the pianos are just like pure champagne on this thing the games feature here is pretty good I love Anderson's jumpy and jazzy vocal melodies on this track and if you were to doubt the sexuality of this album that I think you should listen to the song waterfall which there's a lot of innuendo there especially given the open parentheses inter Lube addition of the title there wink nudge nudge generally I would say I enjoy a lot of the lyricism on this record Anderson is a little more clever and I think playful than your average R&B crooner these days and they're actually quite a few cuts on here which aren't really love themed or anything like that they're actually quite personal and sort of go into Anderson's past either growing up or his struggle as an artist the highlights on this thing continue like on song come down which has a five-star bassline from play right bank there's a mean drumbeat behind this thing to over this track Anderson really unleashes his inner James Brown it's really a hot cut on the album for me even though the song and the beat I think do get a little redundant over the runtime of the track and it seems like they didn't really know where to pull the song next outside of this very funky groove which might explain why it's so short in the tracklist here but that's kind of the case with a handful of songs on this thing either the verses transition toward very underwhelming choruses or Anderson and his producers just kind of rely on almost one sing lube to carry himself from one end of the track to the other and it makes a couple of cuts here stale and in addition to that there are a few songs in the second half here that I think are so smooth they're so breezy they're just kind of forgettable regardless of the quality of the lyrics on these tracks like parking lot or life way and then there's the closer which it's it's a nice warm ending to the record but I got to be in the mood to listen to it because it's so sickeningly sugary I just think there are moments on this record that could have done with more live instrumentation like the very tight sequenced synthetic production all over this thing while it does have its nuances it doesn't exactly set the subtle and dramatic tone that I think some of the softer cuts on this record really needed and the song your prime kind of stuck out like a sore thumb to me because it felt like a slower more skeletal less extravagant take on one of the interludes from Kendrick Lamar's to pimp a butterfly there are a few moments here where I think Anderson drowns and some trendy sounds unfortunately my main issue with this thing is just that I think there's a lot of fat here that could have been cut some songs that were very obviously lackluster and could have either been built upon or just I don't know left out for an EP or just made bonus tracks or something but having said all that there's still a lot to like on this record there's a lot of material here most of it is great just not every single song here in my opinion is a hit or concisely it are very sharply written it sounds like Anderson is so close to something great and something stellar on this album so as a result I think the shortcomings there are on these tracks are a little more obvious I just think on the next release cut the fat and turn up the heat because I think some of the hotter heavier more in a way aggressive and just swagger laced tracks would have picked up the intensity on this thing would have picked up the momentum I think would have made it a little more entertaining but still regardless I do recommend that you check this thing out it's a great funky hip hop fused soul record I'm feeling a decent a strong seven on this thing transition have you given this album oh listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best Anderson PAC Bala boo forever 
b8Z-QjxkZLU,ah hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for review of this brand new Kanye West's track track reviews the title of this thing no more parties Kanye West rapper producer multimedia artist fashion designer needs no introduction at this point as you may know Kanye has a new full-length album slated for release this February titled swish thought it was going to come out in 2015 but no 2016 and he's been teasing toward the release of this album with weekly releases of songs he's back at his good Friday's grind although this song seems to have been pushed forward to a good Monday regardless the last track to come out in this series I enjoyed it a lot real friends it was a very dreary melancholy track that showed yay waxing poetic about the downsides of Fame but in a way that I thought was actually compelling and was completely lacking and the overinflated ego Kanye that you might remember from his past few albums there was a certain level of pain and honesty and sincerity in his delivery that reminded me a lot of his early work a bit of a breath of fresh air because of that and at the end of this track there was a little snippet a teaser of this song over here no more parties in LA featuring Kendrick Lamar and I think this track over here is kind of similar in theme to real friends and that we are getting the trials and tribulations of the limelight but this time we're getting a Kanye that's way more charismatic aggressive in-your-face and funny over a beat that the moment I heard it I knew Madlib had something to do with it yes yes and Madlib and Kanye alone would have made this track fantastic then just adding Kendrick into the equation is kind of just stoking the flames a little bit at least in terms of the hype and the reception and the name recognition I think when it comes down to the quality of both of the verses laid on to this thing Kanye definitely inch past Kendrick I would say a mild past Kendrick and not the Kendricks verse was bad it definitely had quite a few quotable lines in it like The Wrestler line about showing this girl the ropes or talking about a girl looking for a less rapid then telling her to turn around spin it around and then say the alphabet backwards kendricks verse was braggadocious it was great it was fun but all in all it just kind of felt like a very general flirtatious fantasy with some good wordplay whereas what Kanye delivered on this track felt way more personal with each line I felt like we got a glimpse into his life and just like with old Kanye records it's like there's a real sense of sadness and melancholy there but that's kind of hidden and covered up by some really great clever funny bars I loved the part where he was rapping about how they decked out this Maybach and then immediately after an assistant rear-ended someone with it or just crashed it the line about him getting on his Steve Jobs and then firing people I thought was funny the moment when he's talking about how he hates agents he's too black he's too flagrant and then looping that into the line saying that something smells like shit that's the new fragrance and then the bar about just the next generation being victims of mothers or just generally parents who are using the other parent as a meal ticket through custody battles there were a lot of great lines in Kanye's verse and there was actually even a moment in the verse where I feel like he self references this level of quality of the verse that we're hearing here saying that fans never thought that we'd hear kanye rap like this again but he says that the the writer's block is over the writer's block is done I'm not sure what writer's block he was referring to maybe it's something that he wasn't really acknowledging that publicly in the past but it seems that he's kind of pulled that skeleton out of the closet now that he's been able to deliver a fantastic verse on this track and I myself never thought I'd hear Kanye wrapped like this again but he seems to be going back to his roots in a way that's really exciting one other thing I wanted to mention about Kanye's verse on this track as I look how toward the end of his verse he self references the last track talking about the cousin who stole his laptop who he talked about on real friends and it would be interesting to see if further songs and this lead is a good Friday series also kind of linked together in subtle ways like that and it's also worth noting that the way that Kanye said the refrain on this track about no more parties in LA no more parties in LA it's almost as if this lifestyle that he's rapping that is just sucking the life out of him I really like this track I think it's great although still I'm not anticipating that this is what swish is gonna sound like maybe it will maybe it will you know I really like this track I really like real friends but still this sounds like Kanye going backwards in a way which while I do enjoy it it's not something I've ever known him to do on a full-length commercial project if he did that on swish it would be very odd maybe enjoyable but definitely odd for Kanye Kanye but let me know what you think do you anticipate this is the direction Kanye is going to go in with his next full-length album or do you think he's going to move somewhere else and do you enjoy this track let me know Tran oh session have you given this track a listen did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Kanye West forever 
CvPp5zP6ybA,buzzer and hi everyone Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ty Segall record emotional bugger ty is a band leader a multi-instrumentalist a singer-songwriter a very prolific musical artist this is his latest record over here he is an underground psych and garage rock heavyweight and he has a huge growing discography which if you're new to the guy I do not envy you because there's just so many albums to listen to and there are some albums in his discography that I love but in my opinion ty tends to be kind of a quantity over quality type of artists maybe you disagree and that's fine but I feel like he has way more albums I'm indifferent to than there are albums in his discography that I love however he does kind of have an experimental streak that I never know when it's gonna come out and result in an album that I'm totally floored by and I think this record over here is an example of that the punk and garage and psychedelic rock influences continue onto this new project over here but it doesn't feel like tithe simply phoning it in or just kind of riding through this already established blueprint that he's had going for a good chunk of albums right now he's really warping the formula on this one at moments I would say this album is ingeniously weird it's like the music I would normally expect from tide but it's just like melting because of the heat I'm just like sweating walls while listening to this record I kind of feel like I can in a way I was drugged before I put this album on in the way the guitars squawked and they're so noisy they're so textured they're so fuzz out the vocal performances are ways a-near than they've been on some of Ty's recent material especially his last album which I think was one of the most accessible in his and discography so far and it seems like through making I guess some cleaner garage rock music on that release he's just slingshot back into the opposite direction and done something that's solo 5 so grimy so dirty noisy and dissonant and there are moments on this thing we're tie throws in keyboards and glitchy cacophonous electronics as well which only adds to the already chaotic character of the album so it's it's all gravy in a way it kind of reminds me of the psychedelic fuzzy sonic antics of black moths super rainbow except tide does not rely on anywhere near as many songwriting gimmicks to carry himself from one song to the next each track on here is weird as they are kind of has their own distinct mutant flavor like with the song Squealer which has these off-kilter drums and guitars but their syncopated so they're very tight and they actually have a groove that sort of visceral despite it being kind of hard to grab ahold of and the song as it progresses along is packed with these noisy psychedelic guitar embellishments and I'm very into it especially as the choruses bring these heavy washes of guitar fuzz I mean super heavy super thick like 10 deep-dish pizzas and a woman that is on Instagram taking lingerie photos that everyone in the comments is comparing to a bowl of oatmeal like that amount of thickness I mean tracks like candy Sam and diversion are easily two of the heaviest things if not the heaviest things I've heard in the past year metal albums included tie just saturates the mix of these tracks with these guitar and probably bass riffs too that just just fused together with compression to create this monolithic wall of lo-fi sound but the groove and the drums and the song don't really get lost and this wall of sound like it's a very muscular wall of sound it's not like that and blobby and just kind of shapeless these songs especially diversion is just a Hulk of a track really strong lean and and over these riffs ty provides some of his weirdest vocal performances yet bad vision I'm back I'm back I'm back which I like a lot I mean not only are the ear grabbing lis strange but these vocal refrains a lot of the time on these tracks are pretty catchy on the song California Hills I feel like I'm sitting through some kind of slow-mo garage rock nightmare with these occasional guitar freak outs that I think are really great I love the way the song speeds up at the end until it just devolves into this noisy chaotic soup the guitars get super dissonant and dark on Leopard priestess with these good very deep dramatic they kind of remind me of like some old-school Marilyn Manson or something in a way that I enjoy and with the track Squealer to tie actually brings through a track that's super funky and has a lot of swagger so you know it's not just all hell in a handbasket bashing you in the head with a 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire on breakfast eggs and baby big man I think some of Ty's vocals get kind of eerie and unsettling in a lot of ways this record is a loaf I house of horrors and it does with loaf I rock things that I like to hear in lo-fi rock music and for me what's the point of recording a lo-fi rock record if you're going to track it and record it and layer it in the same way that you would a studio rock record you know the point of making a loaf I rock record is to experiment with the sound do something weird do something on the fringes and and tie most certainly supplies that and even though he's doing something really noisy and abrasive and challenging on these tracks he still employs the songwriting basics that he has on many of his previous albums it's controlled chaos it's not just a total mess in a nutshell I feel like I'm listening to the Beatles Marilyn Manson and lightning bolt in some kind of dream collaboration that somehow turns out good for whatever reason I know that's probably not the most apt of comparisons or maybe even something that to you sounds even remotely good but this record really kind of override admirers to the point where I don't even really care I will say though this record is my most favorite thing ty has done in a long time a very long time and while I don't expect to enjoy his next album as much because I never quite know what to expect from ty as long as he dropped something like this or something that I enjoy as much as every once in a while I will continue to try out anything that he does I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this thing transition have you given this record to listen I hope you have it's real good it's real good it's real nice it's real nice if you like your psyche rock your garage rock your punk rock all that stuff you're gonna like this record it's got a lot of balls down our balls to it what did you think of this things you like it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it you're the best Anthony Pantano types of golf forever 
7HGvtP1so68,why did me wet I mean Anna hey everyone Nathan need a tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of this new boots album aquaria this is the debut full-length album of producer and singer and songwriter boots who has been getting quite a bit of buzz over the past few years or so he's been working with Beyonce on her last album where he was working on Beyonce with her last album he actually had a feature cut on that latest run the jewels record that a lot of people seem to enjoy seems he's sort of been climbing up the ladder paying his dues and now he's gotten the opportunity to drop his own very own full-length LP on Columbia Records he has worked in other music projects in the past but it seems like this new album was an important step for him artistically just to kind of hone in just simply on himself and it's not a bad record it's 11 tracks of an intriguing fusion of pop and rap and rock and electronic music and R&B it's like I'm listening to a little bit of Nine Inch Nails and Trent Reznor mixed with some Damon Albarn from gorillas and just a touch of Tom York thrown in there to the tunes at the core of these tracks are sharply written most of the time but what I think steals the show and is the selling point of this record is the production the instrumentation on this thing sounds great not only is it well recorded and well mixed but it seems like boots did a great job of sound crafting some of the keyboard patches and percussion that went into this record just take a look at the intro to the song Brooklyn Gamma it's so huge and dramatic layered the synths are buzzing the guitars have a lot of bite - and the finish of this track is just explosive boots does a great job of creating some very huge dramatic electronic music that fuses so many styles together the rumbling bass fits beautifully against the clickety clackety drums on the track here and the acoustic intro on song Oracle's is pretty as well all the instrumentals across the record are really dynamic and and varied and Jordan knows his way around a hook as well pretty much every song here has a pretty distinct chorus that contrasts well from the verses so this side of the album I really enjoy and commend I don't even quite mind that the influences Jordan has are so painfully obvious because I guess they're executed really well he emulates tastefully but if there's a big Achilles heel to this record it's that being pop music at its core vocals take a pretty big priority and are right there on the front lines and Jordan is not that strong of a vocalist his vocals are not really that distinct his range is not that impressive and there's not really any palpable level of conviction or a motion in his vocals a lot of the time and he's not really that great of a lyricist either having produced on other projects and having produced for other artists who probably have very high production demands I could see why the production on this record is amazing but putting himself out there in a lyrical and a vocal manner that just seems like a muscle he hasn't worked on quite as much the angsty monotone rap verses on this thing are not very tasteful or the poetic poignant points that they try to make especially when they're awash in these robotic vocal effects on the song dead come running which is the worst track on the whole record it's a total mess also the opening verse on the song Oracle's the lyrics here sounds like something Lana Del Ray would write lyrics feel like such an afterthought sometimes and it's it's a bit of a shame because the beats are so good there are moments where Jordan reaches up into his falsetto and sort of is doing a bit of a Tom York thing and in these moments his singing isn't that bad and at least carry you some kind of passion within it and before I finish out this review I do want to mention the song earthquake which has a bit of a Down tempo vibe to it and the somber piano ballad on the track only is a highlight for me too this is not a bad LP I could see why people are enjoying it again the production the beats are fantastic the songs are well-structured good choruses for the most part but the vocals and the lyrics are supremely average if the vocals were a little bit more riveting I think it would have made a world of difference on this LP unfortunately I think they hold back the quality of this project quite a bit but I await the day where there are better vocal performances on a Booth's project I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what should well wait why would you write it what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana a booth for 
uNb39wzdP9U,okay okay okay okay he did it he did it the madman he did it it is the real one real funny one Chano here the Internet's busiest music person and it's time for a review of the new meridian brothers record no sir yes the Meridian brothers is a Colombian music project masterminded by one atlas Alvarez and I've been conscious of their music for a little while now since their 2012 full-length record which dropped on sound way records this record I admired it way more than I enjoyed it it took a very experimental approach to a lot of different forms of Latin music specifically Colombian music and cumbia and while it was out there it was also kind of tedious redundant too but I decided to loop in once again and just try out the the latest release here because it's rare that experimental Latin music is given a platform as large as Soundwave records so now the latest project over you're supposed to be the first record in a trilogy of albums and from what I'm reading this record over here and maybe the following records have been inspired by a legendary Colombian organist who allegedly was well known for playing the organ in an ambient style although I wouldn't call this record over here all that ambient it's actually pretty groovy pretty lively and the instrumentation is really tangible a little hole which isn't a shortcoming I'm just saying this isn't music that really falls into the background and plays an ambient role in my opinion and then there's the fact that I think that this record is a little more straightforward and in a way accessible than a couple previous meridian brothers efforts and the organ does play a really central role in the music the record is mostly instrumental which isn't bad because the the playing on the record is pretty great as is the production I love the warm upright bass and the layers upon layers of percussion sometimes clickety clackety percussion in this record which has a lot of ambient noise around the drums like you really get a feel for the room the drums are being played in from the recording and over these bass and drum grooves the organ sort of slides and skates very gracefully playfully it's got a lot of quirks some interesting Tambor's to the organ on this record there's also a bit of sustain on the organ sometimes so the notes kind of cascade over one another their moments where the organ playing kind of comes off cute like on the song vertigo where I feel like I'm listening to a little tiny cumbia robot other tracks like Dena tema have a bit more bite this track is a rhythmic riot with its metallic twittering percussion and just booming hand drums the organs turn really saucy and there are some quirky background vocals that really add to the character of the track in the second half and of course there are moments on the record that are undeniably danceable even tracks that are kind of weird like deliria which lives up to its title with these dizzying organs which kind of sound like I don't know they're swooping into the song or maybe they're kind of like tiny ghosts that are haunting the track and then there's the fiery Conti endo where in the background of the track behind the instrumentation you can hear these really passionate yeah hey you can tell the band had a lot of fun recording this record and with the song laga drama and the previous track the album sort of shows its eerie side but still there's a bit of quirk here it sounds like I'm listening to theme music from a spooky Latin soap opera directed by David Lynch and hosted by Vincent Price the closing track here is the most experimental in the bunch with this skittering really busy rhythm pattern and some organs that don't quite line up they play off of one another really awkwardly I can't say it's one of my favorite tracks here but it's kind of cool to hear the band doing something you know a little strange to end the album off generally I thought this record was really good I don't have any huge complaints about it other than that it's kind of short a little unsatisfying in its brevity the the cover art is horrendous and I do wish some of the tracks on this thing we're longer but maybe with the following records listening to all of them at once if they're all sort of in this same short length and hopefully if they are they kind of release sooner rather than later the whole trilogy here will feel like more of a complete experience and that's about it I'm feeling a decent a strong seven on this thing definitely check it out if you're looking for some left-field Latin music transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it what should I review next you're the best forever 
3EhF9CZmPHs,hey what up I'm getting my crap together over here BuzzFeed is crap oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new Heinz album over here the band's name is Heinz and the title of this thing leave me alone Heinz is a Spanish garage rock outfit this is their debut full-length LP and this album of theirs has a very particular sound to it it's like all of the echoes from the female fronted post-punk and twee music from the UK and Scotland throughout the 70s and 80s that carried over onto the hazy lazy loaf I sunny Beach rock of the west coast in the US just went right over that Atlantic Ocean landed right in California and then somehow the signal bounced back over to the shores of Spain and now we have this band the result is a set of sloppy fun playful little Beach and garage rock tunes that have a lot of attitude and whether or not that makes up for the very obvious lack of it of experience in the instrument playing and the songwriting is sort of up to you but for me a lot of the time despite that the band draws up a pretty sweet and endearing sound it's breezy it doesn't really cause you to face any difficult emotions or personal demons or anything like that it's the sound of no responsibilities or pressures and if you're looking for some kind of musical outlet to unwind with this might be the record for you but there's nothing really about the goodtime had on this record that makes me want to commit to it come back to it it's just something that's kind of casually entertaining while it's on like I really want to join in with the drunken slurred karaoke style wawas and DAWs on tracks like warts in San Diego like some people I had fun with at the bar but nobody who I would want to hang out with again or take home or anything like that mostly because once you get beyond sort of that drunken haze of fun that's being had there's really not much going on just a lot of very tedious instrumental bits and and song writing the tracks on this record are is rudimentary as they are kind of cliched and their shortcomings make themselves very apparent very quickly if you happen to be having a sober listen to this thing though I will say again for some people I think the sound of the band having fun on this record will make the music here really palatable and will get you kind of wrapped up in it this thing is just really like the taste of the cheap beer and cigarettes that you shared with your friends when you stole them from your older brothers or your dad's secret stash and that's kind of this record in a nutshell I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition thank you for watching have you given this album a listen if you have what did you think of it does it did it did it resonate with you a little bit more than it did with me I mean it was generally a fun record you know some sweet little tunes on there here and here and there but just very breezy very breezy I hope you're doing well and you do best Hines music leave me alone forever 
AZD9mJ_yGIQ,hi everyone blaka knees start on oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new David Bowie record black star the thin white duke David Bowie legendary singer songwriter multi-instrumentalist entertainment icon and up until very recently um alive and I know that that last part of my description might sound kind of callous however it does play Bowie's death very much into the theme and the lyrics of this record in such a way I don't think this piece of context could be ignored it's essential to the narrative of this record this record over here is the follow-up to Bowie's last album 2013's the next day an album that ended a ten-year studio album silence for Bowie as he came back with a sound that emulated his older work but with a heightened sense of self-awareness maybe to the point where it was a little tongue-in-cheek and on his latest project over here Bowie seems just as aware and conscious of his musical past and relevancy but not in a way where it feels like he's trying to redo anything blatantly more in that he's trying to plow forward into some real experimental and left-field territory that is definitely going to challenge listeners and hardcore fans now this record is a very different project for Bowie mostly because I think he was in a very different place as he was recording and writing it and that place is the threshold of death a lot of artists no matter what the medium explore the concept of death it's a pretty universal theme a theme that audiences are interested in as well since it's going to be a part of their experience in life too or has been via the deaths of people around them but I can't think of another instance where it's been so clear that artist was exploring this theme face to face literally like head-on because now we know with David Bowie's passing he had a pretty intense battle with cancer going for the past 18 months it's almost like his job was done here and now that his swan song had been released it was time for him to move beyond and it's like the lyrics and the music videos attached to these songs turned Bowie's oncoming death into an art project and I don't mean in such a way where it cheapens his death as a listener you can kind of in a strange way touch death vicariously through the music of this record tracks like Lazarus and Blackstar and I can't give everything away alone these three tracks alone throw a heap of morbid and occult imagery into the lap of the listener but moving away from the context a bit and talking about what's going on with this record musically speaking before the release of this record Bowie had cited Death Grips and Kendrick Lamar as influences for his music on this record and I think those influences do show up when listening to this thing but in a very subtle way in the instrumentals Bowie similarly creates a very lively organic human feel out of what sounds like guitars drums bass packed into very digital boundaries and within these boundaries Bowie creates beauty but also very intense cacophony to just look at the song Blackstar which though it is very clearly a rock track at its core there are a lot of synthetic elements to it the weird vocal manipulations on Bowie's voice that reminds me quite a bit of Fever Ray the weird blur decent stabs that appear here and there throughout the track the bass instrumentation a lot of the time feels kind of simple but it's heightened by some great string arrangements and an horns too which appear throughout this record the first half of this track is very unsettling it's eerie it's challenging more impatient music listeners might be kind of waiting for when the track is actually going to get started but the second half bowie kind of transitions into something more within his wheelhouse something with more of a glam style swagger to it but still remains the weird unsettling characteristics that were there on the first half of the track it's a really great two-part song that weaves together all these really intricate flavors and lyrical themes very well and if there's another thing that strikes me in terms of the differences between this latest record and Bowie's last record is that he seems to be embracing the weariness of his voice on here in a very big way like with the crack yelped vocals on girl loves me or on the song tis a pity issue was a hoe where we have these shaky singing vocals on the verses and these very intense manic shouts in the second half of the track as the instrumentation intensifies the bass and the drums go way harder and that's topped with these noisy horns wailing away in the left and right channel all and the lyrics take kind of a vulgar turn which seemed similar to me in tone to what Lou Reed was doing on that Metallica collaboration Lulu and before you groan at that comparison Bowie actually was noted to have enjoyed that record and it kind of reminds me of Scott Walker's latest output - with how freakish and and vulgar the lyrics get especially on the song sue where Bowie's singing turns similarly ghoulish over a little gnarly bass and guitar riff and drum beat that sounds like it could have come off of swans - be kind sue really sounds like a fusion of bish Bosch and to be kind but I mean that in the best way possible and James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem actually has drum credits on this track and the song girl loves me - it's easy to see that Bowie was going for something really visceral and propulsive when it came to the bass and the drums on this LP given the personnel and Bowie himself is no stranger to viscera and linear grooves and repetition just look at a lot of his art rock records from the past like station-to-station and heroes and lo so in a way on this record Bowie is kind of returning to his roots but in the most freakish way possible Bowie's glam tendencies do show up on this record though but more on the ballads of the LP like on Lazarus and dollar days and the closing track and these songs make for a very beautiful contrast to the harder and more aggressive cuts on the LP the music on this thing is great for the most part if there's any complaints that I have it's that sometimes the instrumentation is a little too sanitary clean kind of feels like in the digital space where it exists it doesn't kind of bleed together in the way that live instrumentation would so I think there's a bit of an organic feel that's kind of lost on some of the more aggressive tracks and also the Weeping harmonica and very sugary synthesizers on the closing track here do feel sort of dated but it's it's really the lyrics on this record where this project kind of comes to life for me or comes to death and turns super surreal like on Black Star which when I first heard it I thought it was some kind of a cult analyzation of Bowie's popularity fame relevancy but now given his passing and all of the other themes of death that run throughout all these other songs which are way more obvious in the context of the rest of the record it seems like Bowie is talking about being a black star in the sense that he is no longer a star that is light or has light the star is blackened it's gone dark and light being life itself I think and another thing that kind of struck me when I thought about the music video is that there are moments where an astronaut suit broken with a skeleton side is kind of portrayed I'm thinking that's got to be Major Tom and given the song it's it's like the mission that Major Tom was going on it was like a suicide mission or he was just going into the great unknown sort of like how Bowie is on this record over here which is really intense to think about um you know I I don't think Bowie would have self referenced so blatantly if weren't for a purpose and now that purpose seems super clear then there's the song Lazarus which if you know the story of Lazarus he died and came back to life via a miracle four days later and now we have Bowie on the song singing in a way where the lyrics are literally like a transmission from beyond the grave and he's making observations about how he's up in heaven and now everybody sort of knows him which sure given his iconic status isn't really that bold of a prediction that people would be talking about him his death but still it's like too real to hear him singing about it and in the greatest lyrical coincidence on the entire record with the track girl loves me we have Bowie's singing where the fuck did Monday go and with his announcement of his death from this past weekend it's like he didn't even make it to the Monday when I'm recording this review but deeper into the lyrics it's like I'm listening to the deterioration of Bowie's mental and physical being on this track as it seems like he is unfamiliar and scared or freaked out or confused by his surroundings or what he sees he's losing time he's losing his sensibilities his sanity and the song dollar days similarly feels like a descent into death as well especially as Bowie is quite literally singing on this track I'm dying too and the closer really does sound like a final goodbye surely without a doubt it's just really crazy to think of and there are moments in the lyrics here where I feel like I'm listening to Bowie reach that point where he can't give any more can't do any more he's been fully drained or maybe this song in a way is about parting with his earthly possessions earthly relevance and fame because he can't take it with him this is a really strange music listening experience and a deeply moving one as well I was getting choked up listening to the record and thinking back to that Major Tom reference in the music video and just the fact that I mean it literally Bowie is facing death on this record and quite bravely exploring it and it seemed like he made his life all about music and now in his final moments he decided that you know he wanted to spend his last bit of life sort of doing exactly what his life was about and reflecting on where his life was about to go this is a great record you know and I think it's a really interesting that Bowie provided a series of songs that it's it's really no BS I mean there's not really a low point on this album it's almost an hour long and it seems like every moment is just as essential to the next it all plays into this very jaw-dropping odd inspiring look at the end of the life of the artist who's actually creating the music here it's a very surreal experience and the music would have been great even if Bowie lived on for five more years because it explores these themes so incredibly well and does it with some interesting instrumentation great sax solos cool vocal performances that that play to the strengths of Bowie's voice at this point in his life the passion the emotion the weariness I'm feeling a light a decent 9:00 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it did it shake you deep down below emotionally did you feel like you were right there with Bowie at the end of his life on this LP let me know you're the best Anthony Fantana David Bowie rest in peace black star forever 
iQHRtkgi2wQ,"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for track reviews where we talk about the latest in music created by the one the only mr. khan yeh west no but seriously we talk about new music specifically tracks on this segment of the channel and once again in a track review we are talking about kanye west because you know it I know it good Fridays are back the single release series DC spec Kanye West rapper producer needs no introduction has had success with in the past and it seems he is returning to it as he is teasing up to the release of his next full-length album swish which now there is a release date for its going to drop in February so the latest track in this Good Friday series is the song real friends and on the song Kanye shows the side of himself that I don't think we've seen in a while the vulnerable thoughtful introspective side of Kanye which a while ago he's kind of swapped out for this very maniacal puffed-up overstated very egotistical Kanye and it's just inflated up to unrealistic levels where it's hard for me to kind of take it seriously and not see it as funny in some kind of way but I'm not going to digress down that road because again that's not the Kanye he delivers here and on top of this more emotional version of himself he also gives us a flow that could have fit pretty snugly on any number of tracks from late registration or even graduation the instrumental on this thing is very simple but effective it's dreary it's sad it has a very spacious little beat that isn't too complex or anything like that there's not numerous parts to this song it's very simple loop a lot of the time and there are these very ethereal glossy watery keyboards pianos hanging in the background they're very distant very murky but what's crystal-clear in the mix is the story and the emotions that Kanye is getting across and the lyrics here even though the track is titled real friends what is talked about in the lyrics is really anything but on you sort of being in this position where his fame his money has made him compromise his friendships made him cop myiasis close ties with his family members because that fame that money has kind of soured that relationship they need something or it feels like he's kind of grown past some of these people so he needs to avoid them for whatever reason there's even a part in this track where he talks about a specific moment where is cousin has stolen a laptop from him which he had to pay him $250,000 to get back so there are moments on the song where Kanye cites real moments of betrayal but it's almost as if he's kind of a part of that betrayal - because he confesses that he himself has not been the best friend the best family member hasn't really been as dependable since he's made it to this upper echelon of the hip-hop world saying what's the last time he remembered a birthday or when was last time he wasn't in a hurry to get out of whatever family function or event he kind of came in and out of it's kind of heartbreaking and it's one of the few moments where I think Kanye dives into his fame and analyzes it in a way that's actually authentic relatable it's a very sober and honest assessment of the point he's at right now and it's not poisoned by this need to come out looking like a champion and a hero and in control and powerful I think it's a really good track I mean it's obviously not a song that's going to end up on the new album but hopefully this emotional palette shows up on swish because not only would it provide for some interesting tracks but it could be a good counterpoint to whatever songs on there that you know are gonna go completely off the wall so yeah those are my thoughts on this track thought it was pretty great what did you think about the song did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next transition thanks for watching the video smash the like subscribe give somebody a hug eat some fruits and veggies make sure you're hydrated get a best "
cS0bI-chYN8,and then hey everyone loved the knee doesn't a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Benjamin Clementine album at least for now Benjamin Clementine is a pianist a songwriter and a poet hailing from the UK who completely fell under my radar this past year but I stumbled across this record after I saw that he walked away with a Mercury Prize and when I gave a listen to this thing I found that it was a pretty refreshing organic beautiful emotionally stirring album however I will say that there was really nothing instantaneous about this record it took me a few listens to really get what Benjamin was doing on this record or at least be moved by it but once I got into it I realized that Benjamin's music is more familiar in tone than I originally thought if you're into dramatic jazz artists like Nina Simone who find an incredible amount of power in reservation and subtlety and storytelling and in vocal delivery then I think you will like this record and also if you're a fan of French and song a very theatrical style of French music that growl Gainsbourg Leonard Cohen you know artists like that then I think you're going to dig this album as well because it's really a fusion of these two worlds and these worlds are fused to a pretty powerful effect a lot of the time I found myself hanging on Benjamin's every word sort of like I'm a song adios adios the decision is mine really just fantastic and very powerfully stated proclamations all over this track Benjamin's vocal delivery is is stunning and the very tight piano phrases and the the swelling strings really enhance that emotional drama and right in the middle of this song it's like he kind of stops entirely to sort of tell this story or just extend the story of this track into this little detour about coming face to face with an angel and the angel sings a song and then he kind of goes into a different tune entirely there are a lot of highlights on this record from lyrical highlights on the nemesis where it is sung that if you held your breath on me you would probably die a million times and then we have moments on this record which are incredibly just heart-wrenching in somber like the people and I again the music on this record really serves as a foundation for Benjamin to sit atop and deliver a series of costume monologues and very stunning poetry contorted dances and emotional exorcisms now there are some tracks on here which are a little more direct a little more catchy like the song London where the track feels very calculated it feels very planned out it has one of the strongest choruses on the entire record but then there are moments on this album where like the opening track Winston Churchill's boy it's almost as if every single thing coming out of clementines head is being said right off of the dome some of these tracks feel like conversations conversations Benjamin is having with himself or in imagined participant so the record does feature a good mix of these more accessible cuts these tracks with more defined verses and courses and these other songs which sort of seem to be very indulgent in their own little world so it's cool that we get both sides of benjamin on this record but each of these sides of the album have their pros and have their cons the more direct and catchy ER songs on the record the piano phrases and the rhythms on these tracks feel almost looped or they're so tightly synced that the natural fluid groove of these tracks is kind of gone it's kind of lost the organic sound of the drums and the pianos aren't matched with an organic fluid groove to the instrumentation and then the tracks that are more indulgent sort of seem to go so far down the rabbit hole that I'm not really sure how to interpret or make heads or tails of these tracks this mostly happens in the second half of the record where I can sense that Benjamin is putting a whole lot of emotion and energy into the song but the structure of the track is so loose and it's so cobbled together that doesn't really hold any of Benjamin's efforts within it it's like trying to carry a quart of water in a colander but the moments on the album where I'm completely unimpressed are very few not so few that I love the album but few enough to the point where I see the potential in what Benjamin is doing and I see the passion and I think that he's going to continue to progress in his music there are some wrinkles on this album that I have no doubt will be ironed out with future releases because the vast majority of the time on this record Benjamin Clementine comes off incredibly riveting I'm feeling a light a decent seven on this thing Tran you 
7XzAZM_1q1w,whoa hey everyone Anthony Phan tanto here you know who it is Internet's busiest music nerd and you're going to be listening to a new episode of the needle drop podcast we have hungrybox on the show we're gonna be talking about Super Smash Brothers among other things as well and before we listen to the podcast I want to tell you there are a few ways you can support this podcast down there in the link our support page you can get this podcast sent to your email inbox for a small monthly fee it's sent to you on a weekly basis we also have an Amazon Associates link where anything you buy off Amazon using this link if you're in the US we get a little bit of kickback from that if you're buying music doing your regular Amazon shopping whatever doesn't matter we get kicked back from it supports this podcast supports the show you can also like this podcast on YouTube share it with a friend and we're also thinking about doing some advertising as well so if there's something you're looking to advertise and you kind of want to use this podcast as a little bit of a billboard sponsor it that's an opportunity as well hit me up in the d box there's a link down there as well alright and that's all I have to say let the podcast begin hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for another episode of the needle drop podcast where we talk with content creators that although our guest here is not necessarily a creator really more of a competitor within the Nintendo owned fighting game franchise that's been going for 15 years strong now Super Smash Brothers a lot of you might know this video game it features characters fighting one another such as Mario Zelda characters from those respective franchises as well as obscurities from Nintendo's video game history like mr. Game & Watch also picking up acts like Sonic the Hedgehog on this latest incarnation of the game now that Nintendo sort of owns the rights to a lot of Sega video games and characters and my guest is ranked as one of the world's best players and that we're going to be talking with him about Super Smash Brothers in play and more mr. hungrybox is on the show how you doing dude I'm doing well how you do Anthony I'm doing good so the last time we talked you had me on your twitch stream and we sort of had yeah we're actually I was a sort of interviewing you about music which is you know sort of funny I wanted to we you and I have very similar yet opposite interests and you're I would say a much more refined a professional music reviewer and I'm much more accustomed with competing in Smash Bros and knowledge about Smash Bros so it's really interesting that we can sort of bounce back to each other and share knowledge about those respective you know in the last time we talked the only Super Smash Brothers game that I was intimately familiar with was the original incarnation of the game which I spent countless hours playing and I couldn't really speak to any other of the incarnations of the game since like melee and brawl and I believe it was after that conversation is when super smash brothers 4 came out yeah brawl came out I might get it wrong I think it was oh seven or eight and then smashed four of course came out just over a year ago and you know smash four with every iteration of Smash Bros Nintendo tries to of course change a lot of things to make it I think more accessible to many players but they also at the same time try to add in different techniques that more advanced players can use um you know there's always a big dichotomy of you know melee versus brawl in Smash 4 dude how different they are but you know especially now to get smash 4 is been out for a while it's definitely been proving to have a lot of sort of hidden and really interesting advanced techniques that you know some top level players are really getting into and to clarify on I'm not a professional to person mash Bros for the Wii U I'm a pro for melee the one kid I came out yeah you know 14 years ago now but I do play smash 4 I do compete I get kind of whomped it at some times but it's still that's the fight very well of all of the rankings and all the money that I could see being generated in these tournaments it seems like the greatest sums of cash sort of gather within those meal a tournament rankings which is the second incarnation the game and is is there any reason that you think that with one version of the game after the other like the most players have kind of continually centered around this version of the game and and most of the tournament players play this version I think if I describe it in one word it's sort of loyalty in a sense but it's also you know sort of what you're in other words paying for but not really um melee we thought it was going to die with the new version of smash coming out time which was brawl it was dying for sure Germans were an all record low you know you'd have local tournaments with maybe ten people attending it was a simple year we talking here we're talking that we call the dark ages in the dark it is I believe was right around oh seven right okay right before brawl came out and right when I came out so those times in the Dark Ages you know the Golden Age was when male it was like around oh four meted out for a few years the first very old-school pros were you know sort of dishing out all their moves like Ken Isaiah PC Chris all those guys Dark Ages were oh seven one brawl came out but that's what sort of saved melee was just how different brawl came out you had a bunch of guys who just loved playing chess really loved playing chess and then in tendo's like all right guys we know you love chess but try this new things called checkers and that's sort of it's not very accurate but Birol in a lot of ways for melee players especially felt limited the movement options were limited the advanced techniques limited and it didn't seem that there was the same refinement that melee had it didn't see well I noticed in terms of all of the tournaments it seems like the game tournament players are performing with the least yes Oh brawl is completely done brawl is completely gone so mainly survive brawl it also survived p.m. and I don't know if looking PMPM was very interesting it was a bunch of melee diehards I believe who they like brawl but they said what if we can make brawl even better they found out a way to hack into the Wii via the homebrew channel I believe was way back in the day but yeah through just iterations and iterations of tweaking with numbers and codes they created a new version of rawl that mimicked the physics of melee had new characters new stages and was all around sort of a middle ground that brought players loved because they're familiar with the characters and sort of their moves and melee players of course love it too because it was just almost like a second version of the game and p.m. at one point was more popular than melee and brawl and that was a very interesting time um but melee survived it too mainly because although p.m. was great it was far from perfect there was sometimes I do I do want to make note for the listener although the the full name of that would be project M if they wanted to search it our fuck Allen right yeah yeah and if this game at one point was more popular than its official predecessors how exactly were people getting a hold of it well the thing that was the thing that made p.m. and sort of killed at the same time p.m. was free to have as long as you had a copy of brawl okay you download it onto an SD card down homebrew which with online guides honest took maybe half hour at most and then from there it was just completely accessible and you would just download it onto your wheeze and I'll tell you when I was in college especially I would say 2011-2012 almost every dorm room that had you know Smash Bros players in them they were dishnow p.m. constantly more than brawl more than melee more than 64 it was always p.m. it was the go-to thing almost but of course when it comes to tweaking a game's code and releasing it for free to everyone and then players making money off it because they were streaming it or because tournaments were hosting it and giving out prizes that's when legal issues got involved that's when the Tendo got involved yeah and p.m. unfortunately today is actually at an all time low in terms of players and attendance because almost all tournaments major tournaments are no longer hosting it say for a couple of niche ones they're all going with melee and Smash 4 right now and even 64 is making a small resurgence but sadly enough legal issues and ramifications have caused p.m. to you know not be nearly the blossoming great amazing flower that it once was it was definitely yeah I mean a lot of these tournaments are very large a lot of people go they're generating money and there are a lot of sponsorships and voice so I imagine you know that legality issue that there are some sponsors that don't necessarily want to touch tournaments that are openly sort of championing this pirated game yep and it was a Apex in specific that was like our big before Evo came along apex is like the big Super Bowl Smash Bros that happened ever January and it was a 2015 or 24th every which year was but with either the most recent or last recent one listed this year Nintendo sponsored the event and the moment Nintendo spotted the event the host said we're not hosting p.m. anymore which was a huge outcry because that was a game that was probably a guard of the most entrants so definitely a big issue that happened with that and ever since that it's never been the same for PMD money you know it just to kind of give a little bit of history here because Super Smash Brothers right now at least from my point of view seems to be the most relevant fighting game right now and and not only is that due to its quality but it's also because I feel like it almost exists I don't know standing alone a little bit or at least that's what it feels like because when I grew up playing video games I grew up during a Golden Age of fighting games you know from the old 8-bit stuff where you know who's wrestling games or games like kung-fu and so on and so forth and then it sort of evolved onto the Super Nintendo and the Sega Genesis and you had your Street Fighter you had your Mortal Kombat you had killer instinct on the 64 and you had other sort of mortal combat versions that were more violent they were bloodier you had games like Tekken on the PlayStation platform like the fighting is were huge and yet Smash Bros seems to do well it's it seems like all of those games kind of died simultaneously with the birth of Super Smash Brothers I mean while Super Smash Brothers was being birthed that's when you kind of had stuff like Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter coming out with like these really crappy movies they weren't coming up--if like I guess adequate sequels to the classic games that people loved you did have some platforms that people really enjoyed like Marvel vs. Capcom and so on and so forth but a lot of that didn't matriculate over to consoles in time I think to really capitalize on the people's demand for those games because I think they were really trying to make money off of that arcade dollar which for a lot of people would probably be really funny to think of that there was a time when people to play video games would have to leave the house and put quarters into machines in order to play video game and yeah and you know it's a smash the smash bros community in general there's meant the gate the franchise in general obviously with the variety of characters has from like you said Mario Zelda Pokemon you know Sonic now even snake and brawl like Fire Emblem you have so many characters that have to appeal to at least one person that it's only a matter of time before everyone at least tries at your players over you couple that you couple that with the fact that Nintendo not only made a game that is very very deep in terms of top low peak level skill that applies to melee and I would say smash four as well but also it's really easy for casuals to pick up and play for fun and you can put items and you can change all the parameters you can do for players teams free-for-alls crazy stages there's whatever way you want to play whether you're a hardcore tournament player or just a casual guy drunk at a party having fun you know that's what it is like unlike speeding bullet to Heaven Smash Bros has a lot of amazing things about it and you know it's it's it's great and it offers so many different avenues for players to well then I think it's worth noting that when it came on the scene originally in 1999 it completely changed the formula for fighting games completely I mean the percentage system was something totally different you know where previous fighting games it was just like you had a life bar and it got drained and then you lost and the whole idea that you're knocking your opponent off of a stage it's brittle it's like the the these ideas were things that fighting games just didn't have before and and it seemed like the competition previously was sort of in we need to make the most violent bloodiest craziest fighting game with the deadliest looking fighters so you know people so so when they're playing this fighting game it's more like watching an action movie you know and Nintendo sort of comes through with this with this fighting game that aesthetically is really cartoony you know I mean even though it is a fighting game there's nothing I guess disturbingly violent about it you know nope no bullet hits can pick it up and parents because their kids play it and there's really nothing worrisome about the gameplay in any way shape or form but yet there's something also about the gameplay even in the earliest incarnations of the game that's really different from other fighting games in that I feel like it's so visceral like you really feel like when you're playing your character and then you sort of knock them and they go soaring across the screen like you know it's almost as if that punch in that feeling of just throwing your character just away into the trash is just uh yeah I don't know sort of just surges through you as you of course you know like and the fact that recovery is now a thing that isn't Smash Bros that has never really been in any other fighting game you can combo your opponent like most fighting games but when they're off the stage it becomes a whole different thing it's now what option can I choose to mix him up and so I can get back onto the stage get back into neutral before he intercepts me and one of the most famous you know interception moves like if you ever played Captain Falcon or Ganondorf when you hit the down sea stick in the air at the down there it's like a big spike and a lot of characters have these crazy spikes that send you flying downwards if it lands and there's a lot of moves like that the mountain spike you but they intercept you from coming and that's where I would say the majority I would say 90% of all kills and smash and melee come like that mismatch force this may be half in half but edgeguarding it's you know and recovery that's never really been seen before I don't think in any other fighting hmm and yeah alright so so so moving on from I guess some of the history and some of the literal descriptions of the game I guess my question currently is now that I've been sort of react limiting myself with the franchise that I've been playing a lot of super smash brothers for slowly do you see these top tier players who have been kind of melee addicts for so long matriculating over to super smash the super smash brothers for now that I feel like the franchise has come out with a worthy sequel to that game and it seems like a lot of players are enjoying it um I would say you know it's almost like a loaded question it's yes and no because I think every male player has tried it but it's pretty much a coin flip you're either going to be on the side that says well this is a lot more similar to the brawl than it is to melee so I still don't like a lot of people die hard and melee fans and I get to be the same way you know they will only play mainly because melee is all the most unique of all the four titles five you include p.m. smash for obviously a lot more accessible then they're all a lot of melee players who went in who play melee and smash 4 but is very rarely do you see a person who was diehard nail a turning into diehard smash 4 but for brawl every single diehard brawl player went to smash 4 you know with with ease they went and sometimes in very rare cases your bra players who went to melee guys like it was a guy named Mike Hayes who did it um there's some other ones as well I can't or necessarily now but yeah definitely the top tier players for bra a lot of them migrated over smash 4 most notably being 0 and nairo who were pretty much top 3 maybe top 5 and brawl of all time and out of the top 2 best match for players so it's it's pretty crazy to see you know sometimes how incredibly consistent some players can be understanding titles if they're similar enough and one big one big exception is a new to king m2k is a pretty famous smash player he's one of the few yeah I've seen a lot of matches that you've had with him and I'll link a few down in the description box so people can watch the mew2king what's special about him is that he's probably one of a handful players made 5 in the world or less who has been professional I think in every iteration of Smash Bros that has come out I'm not saying like you know wins matches in tournament I'm saying he can on any given day just randomly win an entire term for that game on nearly a top level and it's very rare to have but you know mew2king he was at the moment brawl came out probably considered top 3 or the best in melee after at the exact time he went to brawl and then within like a year he became the best at brawl 2 and that's just with two games that's different that's just an incredible insane talent but we'll show you an 0 the world's best player in Smash 4 he was the best player in p.m. when it finally peaked so it's just the amount of skills they have is incredible well what sort of separates a player like you from a player like mew2king because I have seen matches where you've beaten him um yeah in melee I've got a few times and he's being me too though um yeah I think the night I'd see seen that the main thing is I want to attribute to my character the fact that I play Jigglypuff but it might not be the same I think Dulli puffs just everything clicked for me when I play it from the moment I played her everything clicked for me more than any other character in any other fighting game and any other Smash Bros for some reason Jigglypuff in melee just I knew exactly how to play her from moment I picked her up and it's in brawl I was not bad I was like top five in Florida for Barolo my peak smash 4 and I really been ranked for it but um I a lot of factors to attribute it it's just the time you put into things and the fun you have with it I simply have this so much more fun with melee but you know yeah there's one particular match that I remember seeing both of you play out where he's sort of playing Fox you're playing Jigglypuff and you two are chasing each other around the screen in such a way where it's like you move right he moves right he moves left you move left and it's like you're keeping the same exact amount of space in between one another while throwing punches throwing lasers at one another but no but none of it's like very little bits actually touching and it's it's kind of like an insane I don't know matrix thing not going on it's pretty accurate actually in melee Pau versus fox in a nutshell if one character touches the other it's pretty much death or very close to it it's one of if not the most volatile matchup and all of melee I would say because I died from Fox at a very low percent but I can kill him it from 0% if I'm no my combos so there is basically an invisible like bean pole between us constant being pushed and then we're just waiting for one of us to make a hiccup or mess up one pixel of spacing one l-cancel one movement and then we go in and we go to town we completely demolish their stock um and that's what you know that's not what mail has gotten to it's that fast that crazy but you know that's one more reason that I really do love it well if there is one thing I noticed about the melee game playing again I'm saying that I'm not terribly familiar with the game because GameCube is just not really that that big of a system for me you know I kind of a jumped onto ps2 around that time yeah but um one thing I notice when I watch the tournament play it seems like the game moves incredibly fast like it seems like the speed of the game is is much quicker than what I've seen on brawl and maybe in some respects faster than for you are very correct in that regard yes yeah and it seems like even if there were a lot of I guess uh strong points about Super Smash Brothers for going to a platform going to a version of the game that is inherently slower could be just a serious learning curve for somebody who's so used to melee and that's very true yeah a lot of malt that's why so many many players on brawl came out were so dis weighted and they just said well I can't do the cool stuff I do in melee you know screw this but again it's all it's all relative a lot of players thought it was the best thing that ever happened to smash a brawl came out and a lot of players are just completely in love with smash 4 because it's like a refined better brawl so to each their own in that regard and it's just another example of why smash is so damn you know appealing to so many people and it would be a great day when you know every player would be willing to put in at least some amount of time and see their peaks in every single game I know I tried to it doesn't always work out but at least I give every EMA chance to smash for sure all right so getting a little bit into the tournaments that you compete in because really that's why you're here you know the game is great and we love the game and we can get into super smash brothers for talk a little bit later about some specific characters but sort of tournament play when is your next tournament how often in the year do you see yourself going to these tournaments and in them how how many players do you find yourself facing sure oh my next tournament is Genesis 3 which is this weekend in San Jose California it is one of the biggest tournaments of Smash Bros of all time and just today it was announced that Nintendo is also sponsoring the event so it is a massive massive event and players from literally around the world are all attending for melee smash4 and 64 and we're expecting about 1800 for melee just over thousand for smash for about two and we're talking competitors competitors people injures eighteen hundred competitors yes and that's only for melee so totally about three thousand people go into this event it's a three-day event so it's coming massive and it's also the largest smash fifty-four tournament of all time - by coincidence so amazing gonna be great um I travel to tournaments I would say once a month I would say on average I do have a full-time job so sometimes it's hard to balance um but you know if I balance on vacation days it all works out especially if it's like a one day or two day event I could get a early flat head back to work um and what was last question um well I was going to ask in that one day two days span of time where you're sort of taking off work heading out to this tournament how many players do you find yourself facing if you are playing up to the quality that you usually are and you make it to what the final top ten top five the finals yeah how many players do you face over that two day sort of a span so because smash and I guess melee in Pacific has evolved so insanely much I usually only tell the tournaments now that have you know pretty good pot bonuses good incentive for me to going you know sort of worth my time and effort to go to but yeah these Nationals you know back in the day we used to struggle to get maybe one to two hundred people but now that's like that's like child's play now whenever I travel to there's four categories there's local regional um national and super national there's different names with those for let's say level four is the biggest one a level three event will have nowadays maybe five to six on people four to five hundred six or people and if we do with pools to a bracket off to play maybe five people in pools and then to get to the finals in the bracket to get to the very last match I have to win about maybe something along seven to eight sets to win the whole tournament but again progressively harder because the bracket um nowaday is a super national always gonna have over a thousand people like it's just amazing how much the game is grown ever since documentary came out mmm and and how many consoles are people bringing down how many consoles are set up who's keeping track of just all this mayhem who's winning who's losing like how many people are searching on have to sort of you know make sure that all of this is coming together in an orderly fashion and that you know when you make it to the finals that it's because you've beat X amount of people and it's kind of an tallied up until that point and that's a very special occur with people that we refer to as TOS tournament organizers who are honestly the the backbone of the entire community they're the guys who you know pain sweat and tears and just all so much sleepless nights to setting up for these events organizing blueprinting scheduling everything you could imagine for a major convention they're doing to make sure that all these people who are flying out from the world you know paying you know sometimes $100 to get into an event to enter things making sure they have a full and fair and justified tournament experience and they're honestly like they're they're very cursed in the community I would say and we have them and we have also streamers and streaming has become a huge part of competitive gaming too because now players can watch the event from anywhere from around the world it's basically identical to you know live broadcasting of sports but on Twitch especially that's the main platform oh yeah I mean I've seen some of these guys it's like it's like a sports announcing table it really is we have commentators and it's actually a very yeah and commentators you know they make a living off that ad1 one of the most notable commentators he's a full-time solid position as a sports commentator or for Smash Bros but working for twitch and so it really is a great booming you know sort of business when it comes to that and it we just we take a lot of inspiration and I see sort of maybe information from how sports your broadcasts and how sports are analyzed and we try our best to apply that and our own unique ways to smash broz and it makes the viewing experience and especially the playing experience all that much more interesting because now players themselves can rewatch their own sites they can see the stats that are being put out another shout-out is a guy named Taff oaken's who is the pretty much the premier statistic I think it's the word he does stats from it for Smash Bros and it just it's incredible what you can do just by analyzing gameplay and the amount of people who go to tournaments and matches and all that's really cool is he a part of the community of people who you know the the websites that pop up when I type in Super Smash Brothers tournaments Super Smash Brothers rankings and I see these boards and I see these websites that are basically ranking all the top tier players and how many matches they want and and how much money they've made and so on and so forth there's a whole community of people sort of gathering that information yeah there's a few of them the main ones I would say the biggest smash broz website is smash boards it's that was been run for a while MLG used to own that much of they still do there's also everything is run basically for tournaments mainly by Facebook now in terms making events but guys like Taff oaken's that he's part of a team called may lay it on me that's the biggest melee group biggest like serious melee group on Facebook and he also runs a website and he was in charge of compiling the rankings for this year it's the melee Tommy smash rank I think it's what it's called the top 100 players he does it every year and compiles them and they actually just finished that ranking I believe yesterday okay okay so we've gone over the people who organized the tournament the tos we've gone over the people who are sort of streaming these things they're announcing for them the people who are gathering the information and the statistics but really what about the players alright is there anything in particular that sort of separates the people who head out to these tournaments from just your average casual Super Smash Brothers player um there obviously has to be some sort of difference yeah the way these top players see the game and you know now I've been you know fortunate enough to now be in this position where I can I can see the game almost from near the peak in terms of the competitive ladder um I began just like anyone else you know just a guy who loved the game and thought he could beat all his friends and kick his brothers ass of the game and he said man I'm really good I'm gonna go to these tournaments and I got spanked so many times then eventually I started winning a little more here a little more there I started learning and it's really the love for the game that drives everyone but you know there is a clear clear skill gap there's people who've been playing for 10 years and they still have yet to win a local you know I mean it's it's just because you put a lot of time into something doesn't mean you'll be the best at it professional you'll be really good but these professionals I believe it's in a lot of inherent talent talent azar sort of born with they're people who realize that for whatever reason they have the ability to understand the physics of each game understand facing understand matchups and really understand not only how to play get some her characters but how to play against different players most relevant examples in melee is theirs for the past couple years there has been a big six six players who are you know defined as a cut above the rest and even before then for the four years maybe five years before that there was a they called the five gods of melee and they were just a tear above everyone else for whatever reason and the data kept proving it improving it improving it very very rarely where they lose to people who aren't who weren't each other you know so it's very very interesting and I think Smash Bros is very unique in that respect that there is a small but select tier gap between the top players the next best player the comic demigods the gatekeepers and all that but especially more recently anything apart from a few select people like the best play in the word Armada all the top players apart from him have lost sets the people ranked underneath them and it's because the gap is closing because everyone's pushing the meta and the skill to this game to almost alien level at this point and just being part of that has been nothing short of remarkable just seeing how the game can evolve and you put that much time into it so how exactly to other people sort of get involved in it you know let's say you have someone who's really passionate about the game and they're interested in going into a tournament this isn't a situation where I'm asking for a friend you know I'm sure there are people who are listening or genuinely curious how does one get involved in a tournament sign up for a tournament and and how does one know when they're really ready and prepared I mean is that sort of is is there sort of a required skill level that you should expect of yourself or should you just continually go and go again as you just get your ass kicked over and over and over until you improve the one requirement that you need to have when you enter your first measurement is be okay with losing you are not going to win your first match determine if you are a casual I just never will happen however when you go you automatically two times better than you are when you left it is the act of competing and the act of understanding how to play against people with skill that allows to absorb information absorb skill and apply it to yourself I encourage anyone who wants to go to look at tournament simply go on Facebook and type in their city and then smash or their city name and then melee or their state name and smash or smash 4 melee google search for just your state your city and smash and something will come up even like you know if you're a guy in South Dakota type in South Dakota Smash Bros on Google and you will find I guarantee it at least a Facebook page or some kind of hub or subreddit smash the big on reddit as well that gives you compiles all the information allows you to find other players local events it's a very very wonderful time to play Smash Bros just because the amount of resources that there are so Google is your buddy and the game is so popular that audiences are even if you started your own thing you know some people might show up yes exactly and I host tournaments as well too even an Orlando I was fortunate because it's a very very popular place to play smash but chances are if you're near any urban area any decently large city there will be Smash Bros players guaranteed and there will be at least a few competitive players and that's all you need to get started as a couple guys who want to be each other's as in Smash Bros and then that's how it got started so the fuel starts and is there anything specifically that you would recommend to somebody could be either a playing tip or could be something as simple as a broom you know making sure you bring a particular thing that you don't forget is is there anything you would recommend to a listener to sort of prepare for one of these tournaments if they were to go one if they were to compete in one a brain controller uh weird deodorant I guess is given because you're sitting close to everyone you'd be surprised actually but yeah do that go to a tournament um and even before you play your matches just sit down at Open TV and play as many friendly as you can the photos aren't familiar our friendly refers to any match that is not part of an official tournament bracket so but there's a lot of opportunities to play outside of the bracket while you're there Oh tons especially if that's a thing if players are responsible and they bring their own setups which is very helpful their own you know big TV or flatscreen for smash for their own system and bring controller or their own controllers you can play and practice a lot even hours before a term begins and these the big Supernationals like Genesis big house even Evo if you go before the event starts like couple hours they will let you play they will let you warm up and plan them and you rotate on TVs and y'all you got all you got to do is ask hey can i play next and the community we will let you play next especially if you're a new guy to say hey it's my first time here is a cool fight play you're never going to get like a dark you know bad I like get away from your kid unless the very top player um trying to warm up for a very special match like if you're in a big super national and it's day 3 in event and top 8 is about to happen and you see a top player playing on a television that is a very bad place to have to play cuz I I have turned down many people before because when you're in top 8 I believe you have the authority or the right to request TV to warm up to play your absolute best because where you're there for but when it gets there earlier state is day 1 and day 2 for sure man play with anyone play the top players clickable your age play with your friends became to them just play as much as you can to warm up and play against as many different people you know don't only play your friends play that guy from Oklahoma play that Yoshii player from Japan play that you know Ghandour from Canada just do it play it learn the matchups and experience it in your experience and this is something that I've been doing recently on the game is there anything that you would say is kind of lost in translation in the act of just going online and then just playing a bunch of people for glory because it kind of seems like I don't know they're a bunch of gimmicks and patterns that sure that sort of show up in everyone's fighting style over and over and over there's also the potential for lag and then on top of that it seems like not being able to communicate with the person who you were playing and kind of a friendly manner and sort of learn from one another as far as the gameplay sort of takes away from the ability for this to really be like a learning experience if there's anything I've learned playing and streaming for glory online it's this if you win a for Glory match or foglar tournament you're not good if you lose a for glory match or fulgor tournament you're not bad that is all there is to it I would for glory at the bare minimum allow how's players who are far away from other people to compete in practice and sort of adapt you can still use to practice but I would not use it by any means as an accurate gauge or someone's skill because of those factors because of lag because when you have a fighting game you need those frame perfect abilities you need to understand when to and where to move against certain characters you know playing against a character like I don't know like cloud you play against cloud online sorry I'll get the cloud online it's going to be extremely difficult when you play them in person it might not be as bad because you understand where he's going to be in certain times and there isn't that lag and lag if I can curse just fuck's with you so badly so so yeah no no you can certainly curse here and I know just just my personal experience here I played I decided to go on for glory I decided to log on the night they premiered cloud oh yeah that was 16 clouds per tournament it was and I got my ass kicked like two dozen times he's a good character he's really really good outside but then after I downloaded him and then I learned his moves and then I was playing the computer and then I was playing some other people for glory uh who was playing cloud then I started to win some of those games but the thing is like when I was first playing him and I hadn't played him yet and at that point I had you know maybe beaten the game with half of the Super Smash Brothers characters and I've played all of the rest of them at least and you know several different matches but when I was facing him I was like oh new character you know but it seemed like every single move that he had was just completely unpredictable for me because I wasn't familiar with his moveset at all exactly and that's what every new character guard download them and learn everything about them go to tournaments and just you have to learn how they can fuck you up before you can fuck them up and that's big as easy as it gets pretty much you just got to learn all the new stuff they have all the new bullshit as I would say so yeah that's the thing I mean to really excel at any character and maybe there's something specific to super smash brothers for I mean you have to have played almost every other character that's on the list of characters because you sort of want to know what their strengths and weaknesses are yeah even of like I said we were talking about earlier before the conversation you know low tier high to your characters one of the worst character is considered in smash 4 is you know they have like Jigglypuff Zelda someone say we fit trainer Charizard you can go against the chars are internment or Wii Fit trainer and still get you know almost beat without them getting a single hit without you getting a single hit on them because it doesn't matter at that point if you are a casual competitor you can be the absolute best casual player in the world and get completely completely molly-whopped by even the worst advanced player because it really is that knowledge they have them saying I can't pull this off halftime but at least I know how to pull it off that's just it caused such a huge skill gap that's why I encourage all players to just look up online look at what your character can do it's all there for you it's already learned yeah absolutely because the thing is even if somebody is playing a weaker character even if somebody is playing a low tier character I mean my personal favorite character is Little Mac but he's a very clearly flawed character like I'm very familiar with his weaknesses so that makes me concentrate even more on the things he can do well a lot of Super Smash characters even though they may have different smashes and different moves different skill sets a lot of the I guess evasive maneuvers are basically similar across a lot of the characters you know I mean some some characters do have like you know super like special teleportation abilities but a lot of those evasive maneuvers I mean if somebody is an advanced smash player even if they're playing a low tier character if they can evade and predict everything you're going to do even if it's with a high tier character I mean they'll obliterate you pretty quickly yeah which I bring up I forgot to mention another thing makes smash unique is that every character roughly has the same input for all their moves you know up be down be left piece or slightly yes that that's another thing that you know I think kind of revolutionized and you can play exactly you can play every character at least you know fundamentals because you know how to input all their moves it's not like Street Fighter or Tekken where you have to know these very specific strings of inputs which I honestly I friggin love that about Smash Bros but like you were saying in terms of evasion that's true every character you got to recover some way you every character has a shield that's you know sometimes have different sizes but you can roll very character you air dodged every character which is sort of a midair you know you get away for a little second but different characters have very fast dodges or very slow dodges compare like Mewtwo's dodge for instance to Falco are foxes and it's completely night and day the speed of those daughters or the speed of the roles and and a lot of times it is to balance a character out although all some of those balances are extremely questionable I would say all right let's let's talk a little bit about the specifics of the latest Super Smash Brothers game and some of the flavors of these characters as we're sort of discussing balances and that that's something that I think going off of somebody who we were just talking about cloud where I um he was the first character that once I downloaded him and I played him and and I would like to get more familiar with him and uh and sort of you know play more battles with him within the game itself but he struck me as a character who was super overpowered sure in in every respect I mean seemed like he had good ground game good air game uh all of his yeah smash attacks seemed pretty great all of his special moves were pretty impressive as well and the fact that he could sort of supercharge his moves too was something that me is a little Mac player really aggravated me because that was like that was like a special ability that only my character had because my character sucked at everything else right and it's interesting that you pull that up because you know clearly clouds but Little Mac however cloud and Little Mac have something very similar that only they have in the game and it's that both of their standard recoveries just suck complete dick little max is a different like revolution of dick but clouds is considered the second or third worst in the entire game unless of course you charge the limit that downbeat charge will be talking about what makes him interesting unique is that if you charge that move up you can use it in one of four ways up be neutral be down be your side be yeah super charge on all of those moves Oh base it's super TARDIS one of them so as soon as you have that all charged up the moment you use one of those moves again it's going to release that move but it's like hellishly stronger and with one exception if you use up be his recovery move while you are chartered limit it's not only stronger it essentially I say outside doubles the range of his upbeat and makes his recovery actually incredible so the funny thing is they at least gave him that option of having a recovery if you know how to time you charges when it comes to little Mac if you are off the stage and I would say maybe one platform distance away maybe platform and a half you're done there's nothing you can do there's zero option you have nothing you are completely dead rip but little Mac has one of the best ground games he has super armor on his moves but it's just so funny that now Nintendo would include cloud whoo although he doesn't have super armor has an incredible aerial game you know his uh pair is just phenomenal as neutral air reaches around a ton um forward air spikes down air you can spike with it too and it just has amazing lingering and knock-back time you know it's just it really is questionable sometimes how the Tendo can you know put that balance in it's just cloud is better than Little Mac and nearly every way so just interesting thing about I know what it makes me sad I'm sorry buddy no it's okay hey you know I I little Mac his his easy underdog man you can't just give him everything I love him and I think if I play any kind of a puff I'm gonna be honest I get completely shit on by any little like I play like I have no idea what to do go with puff I don't do you just throw them off hit him once taunt and you get to go so are there any other characters that you sort of favor other than than puff oh it's bad for ya actually because puff plays um she's so bad in Smash 4 I've been sort of forced to play other characters um so I've stuck with villager Mario and one more was it um I'm having a brain fart villager Mario and someone else but yeah so villager Mario and puff I believe are the three that I've been sort of trying to play and understand the most and you know get used to and villager is floating like puffs but he has a lot longer range aerials he's really annoying to play against you can camp with him and a lot of people will let you know that I like camping sometimes and Mario is just Mario it has what puffs doesn't have which is just a incredible fundamentals of Mario if you know how to play Smash Bros on any game you can play Mario you know like it grabs you know dodge and move Mario's very moves very fast versatile he has good kill moves he's a very smash character um so there's yeah Mario is basically like you know the basic pack yeah right on butter but it's it's simple but effective um exactly I would totally agree so that's why I have played him occasionally and local he'll do well but I have yet to have a big break out national appearance in Smash 4 so I'm hoping to do it this weekend in Genesis I might play all three characters and maybe some cloud to know ok so so what's your take generally you know give it given how much you enjoy Jigglypuff you know for her vasive 'no sand her floating as her speed some of which is lost in Super Smash Brothers for the UM what's your take generally on some of the bigger slower hulking characters that I mean while they may not evade very well it seems like if they catch you and they can predict you well enough they'll smash you pretty early uh characters like Bowser Ganondorf and another personal favorite of mine King Dedede um yeah a heavyweight has never been the best character and he's a nice game but there have been times where they've been pretty good in brawl key yeah I mean I've noticed they don't tend to rank very high in the tournaments just speed over power always for in terms of a top-tier character always speed as always with pushing them forward and smash for they have some balances Bowser can kill you a very early percents and he's pretty floating his recovery isn't that bad actually Bowser and smash fight I don't think and even doc yeah Bowser recovers pretty well in DDD to I mean he has almost as good recovery as any floating character like Kirby exactly and but the problem is that sometimes you do need speed and even Donkey Kong hat can kill you with his up there from like 60% but at the same time he still is big fat-ass DK and you can get combo to infinity pretty much but infinity but really hurt with one grab or one punishment so it's a trade-off to play those characters and you know they can get really far and bracketed me wrong especially in Smash 4 I would say the weights have that potential I didn't have especially like Meili for instance but at the same time they're not the best you know DKR Bowser I don't see him being the beating the best zero sewer chic there's simply too much twenty options at the fat girls house yeah I mean it's uh it just seems like the the slowness is just something that at least from what I've seen so far in the videos of competitions that I've watched it just seems like it's something that that no player has just been able to overcompensate for yet and I think it's just kind of easier to go toward you know a faster character than try to I guess kind of I don't know figure out this endless Rubik's Cube of how exactly to play this character against a more advanced player who is playing such a fast Super Smash Brothers character um yeah man it just comes to well if you favor having fun with the character and really pushing it forward versus you know playing the character that's best for you competitively yeah you know it just depends us so what you favor more honestly so it's just just how it goes so you play for different reasons if you want to play to win sometimes it is you know maybe you're not going to win with here with a load to your character and with your chars are your selves that maybe you do have to apply the same fun methods you have but apply it so the character smash4 has what fifty six different characters I think that's a shit-ton I carry god is that how many it's I think it's 56 at this point I file and that's the most by far the most any smash game has had so there's at least not one I would say not two but even three characters for everyone just because it house how many similarities are so play every character and if your mains I'll cutting out for you the game still early it's still fresh enough for you to pick up a new character maybe Bayonetta when she comes out maybe Corrin maybe claw just came out or Ryu or maybe one of the old school ones play every character you can and find what fits you you know it's like in Harry Potter like the wand selects you sort of thing like the character you don't have to force yourself to play care you don't like the right one will you know pretty much illuminate to you what you start playing yeah I mean I've kind of personally been consistently drawn to these characters and I mean I haven't always played well with them but I've always been drawn toward the characters to have the quirk year weirder harder to predict playing styles you know for a while I was playing with mr. Game & Watch I still stick with Little Mac and I'm kind of drawn toward duck hunt at the moment although I haven't figured out how to adequately play the character in such a way where I'm like winning consistently yeah he's definitely one of the waiters I struggle against them but he's a very unique and very strange and can't be people have likened him to snake and brawl but a another good example of just the complete variety it's mesh for offers you know it's just insane even Ryu has the same inputs similar to what add in Street Fighter which is never before been done in a Smash Bros game so they're just pushing every direction and there really is a character for everyone yeah if there's something that's pretty interesting about Ryu and Megaman as well it's it's like they play within the smash game as about as perfectly to the original as they would in the games they came from uh yeah and sometimes the childhood nostalgia really pushes forward if you had a good time growing up playing Mario games or Pokemon games you're probably gonna be more inclined to play I could Pokemon or Mario character oh god that's why that's probably why I play a little Mac man because I sped up so many countless hours playing punch-out dude great game I love punch-out it was one of my favorite games that's so good so so yeah that's that's probably why I'm just I'm just a sucker for a nostalgia that's in I never got past them what's the guy's name the Sandman mr. Sandman is that his name the black dude I think I really was yeah I couldn't ever be mr. Sandman he's he's pretty beatable I mean I I personally I haven't beat Mike Tyson so oh he's hard my 10th and stuff I think I down the game once and I try to I finally beat him but it's just so difficult alright so uh moving on from the game a little bit let's talk about the future quickly before we have finished things out sure what are you looking forward to in the future as far as a super smash brothers player do you think the community is going to continue to grow do you think there's room for improvement in the next Super Smash Brothers is there even a reason to drop another Super Smash Brothers for the next several years I mean can Tendo & Company just continually just like add characters through DLC and just kind of stay on this one platform for you know the next three to four years um honestly like there's no reason to drop a new smash broz until the new like next-gen conjugates release and even still I see smash for being around for at least another five years there's so much there's such a good active community for that game and so many characters to play and options to do that you know newid techniques are just obviously going to be discovered in this short period of time they're going to get evolved and they're gonna get adapted they're going to get transformed over the next few years and it's going to make the competitive scene a lot more interesting and the casual scene is always going to be there because in tendo diehards always exist and you know if melee can live that long you know who's to say smash four can do that too you know maybe there's fanatics then diehards and people who are willing to sort of give everything they have to keep a game alive like it happened with melee with the evo2013 situation and the documentary which a lot of people who hear this if you haven't heard about you know the history of melee I really do recommend you watch the Smash Bros documentary that sort of explains how everything happened and especially the later the last couple episodes like the very last episode I believe goes into how melee was saved by this big breast cancer donation drive in which we beat out other old communities and it sort of blossomed melee back into life and then made the game bigger than it ever has been so miracles like that do happen and we've seen this community overturned corporate decisions you know Nintendo didn't want you know their games streamed at all and the community came together and they said you can't tell us not to stream that and with all the support got you know a Nintendo's decision overturned in two hours who's to say that smash 4 can have the same story one day given the amount of love that's in the game of the amount of passion that serve certain gamers have for it yeah yeah I mean Nintendo and I don't know if this has changed recently has had kind of a bit of an oppressive approach to how people sort of put content up onto YouTube as well you know as far as like Let's Plays and that sort of thing oh yeah and dug it like Nintendo is a great company you know I've hung out with Reggie a couple times great dude they all have very good intents and they all know what the players want the problem comes with I believe the Nintendo corporate from Japan perhaps I think the culture there's it's very different from America's and what they sort of expected their games and creative content there are some market differences from America and Japan but at the same time Nintendo they know their players are their audience that's their business and they know what the players want and a lot of times because Smash Bros has so many franchises within it you know fireman Pokemon might as went over it every time that you add something new or tweak something in the game you know a lot of parties become involved and it's not always perfectly as easy as saying hey let's add a knuckles why not we're anything that we can do it that's not true you gotta go through Sega I get their sound check approved you gotta get all these little things improved whatever owns a character and their creative rights it's a very complex process and yeah I mean we're talking about the world of copyright here which I'm very familiar with because you know I mean you deal with it every day in the music world of course and before before I - now new Kanye a new radio you gonna drop the next month I'm calling it just like calling right now um Boas saying yeah copyrights are very important you know you can't you can't really mess that stuff at you know too much especially when he gets the legal world there are limits unfortunately um but throughout time Nintendo I think is now understanding especially more what they were seeing the love that the players after this game both in casual and competitive lights and they're doing their best to appeal to both audiences and you can see that with the addition of like term of motive for glory you can seal it with the addition of you know Sakurai giving players pretty much the hall the option here you can do customs for your character or you can just do no customs at all if you want to play you know vanilla standard you know competitive smash there's a lot of instances now a Nintendo is seeing not only the amount of people int but the market that there is within competitive gaming and you've seen other smash games and other video games League of Legends Starcraft you know Han dota all these other games that have these massive pot bonuses from competitive you know stand points because the company supports them that much because they see the amount of fervor there is an amount of you know pretty much profit in money be in competitive that's how sports if I football and basketball are so big in America because not only is it a pastime not only do we love it it is a way of basically making a living for some people it's a way of entertainment it's an industry in its own light so I'm happy now that Nintendo you know as you can see just today with the sponsorship of an event like Genesis 3 once again they're pushing for it they're pushing for competitive and they want to support the players and you know sort of make better of the past mistakes they've made in terms of support but it seems yeah being an older company Nintendo is probably always going to have those copyright laws in the back of course of their respective minds because that's how the company came up and that's how the company sort of protected itself up until this point but now we're sort of in the Internet age the game world is incredibly competitive right now especially with platforms like Steam out there and if Nintendo doesn't give players what they want in terms of the ability to play the game and have fun with the game in the way that they want to have fun with the game they're going to go have fun somewhere else especially since video games have now reached this the this peak of mass media saturation that they haven't been at before you know when I was a kid video games were like for nerds and nowadays it's like everybody has a console or you know or at least plays on their computer or plays on mobile I mean games are pretty much everywhere they're unavoidable now yeah we're all nerds in some kind of way it's quickly that's cool bitter about it is if we stop yeah nerdy nerdiness has also become mainstream exactly I think like there still is like different levels of being a nerd but you know games are games are beautiful it's I think everyone can see it and now with this new generation and sort of the babe the baby boomers becoming old and now the actual you know Generation Y however you call it it's the generation that's raised on the Internet pretty much and the Internet is just a complete access to a world of gaming in a world of culture within gaming that becomes as part of everyone's life one way or another and it's just the best thing we can do is embrace it and make it grow it what's possible and speaking of Kanye before we head out you you use and his hype music you use him to pump yourself high you pumped up to Kanye that was one tournament if you search the big house 3 a hungry box versus a guy named dr. PP or ppmd that was the losers finals of a pretty you know notable tournament and I was losing I put on uses from trak-1 and listen to it until you know halfway there and just completely got motivated and went completely apeshit and popped off after I won because Jesus was flowing through me I mean in your tournament videos I often see you wearing earbuds I mean are you listening to music while you're playing sometimes I do I recently I don't do it anymore but depending a lot of the people in the crowd can times don't like when I win so I sort of put in earbuds to to not listen to him and to stay motivated because a lot of people don't like Dulli puffs which I understand and sometimes I do sometimes I do it's like motivate myself I I will be honest when we first talked and we first sort of met online and you were telling me about this world that I didn't even know existed of competitive smash and then I'm just like oh what did you play you know what who's your who's your go-to character you're like oh Jigglypuff I'm like what the fuck yeah of course of course is he serious like I just feel like he's lying to me because he knows that I don't know about this world and it was us and my balls like I thought you really breaking my balls but then once I saw videos are you playing online I was like holy fuck yes you can he's a fucking menace I'll be honest in melee she's just insane but uh yeah man it's a the I hate playing against there too sometimes so I'm just in that in that same respect I totally got it I totally get it but I'm never gonna stop playing the character ever ever ever ever ever so yeah alright my guest on this episode of the podcast has been hungrybox a competitive Super Smash Brothers player Jigglypuff is his mane and you will see him competing at numerous Super Smash Brothers tournaments in the future like I said I will link some videos down there in the description where you can actually see him competing see him playing and down there in the description I also want to link this if there is a page that you can recommend to me where can people see this Super Smash Brothers a documentary that you've sort of been referencing a couple times Oh sir um on YouTube just type in on the Smash Brothers just exactly sound documentary the Smash Bros documentary and if that doesn't help also type in the director semak's si M o X it's 9 episodes so you can watch each one its own pace it's 4 hours total in length but it's not meant to be watched all at once but it's like not it's 9 episodes and it's just it's a beautiful piece of work that really documents all of its Mele by the way it's specific to mail it but it really does give me appreciation for you know the small small roots this game has into what it is now it's amazing pretty much I was going to say you can search that down over on Google if you want or I'll put it down in the description box and also put links to your social media down there in the description box too yeah twitter.com slash liquid h box and on twitch i'm hungry' box and on facebook crs hungry boxers my hold sponsor but you can't change it so i'm on those three and of course for all the new players definitely definitely definitely this weekend go on twitch calm and you should see smash bros on the front page and now now I'll be Genesis 3 which is going to be one of the biggest smash events in the history of the entire game so I highly recommend Friday Saturday Sunday go on Twitch watch that they'll have all three games you're gonna love it ok I'm going to try to drop this this weekend so people can kind of react to that as fast as possible so for sure alright cool man thanks for coming on hey thinking about appreciative [Music]

JEWru_PBRoc,Hey hey everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new lil ugly Mane album oblivion access will ugly Mane aka Shawn Kemp aka Travis Miller aka that Southside tickler nobody calls him that this is his highly anticipated swan song project oblivion access even though this is supposed to be the last little ugly main thing Miller doesn't exactly hype this project up on the band camp page where you can find this he sort of describes it as a pile of skin flakes blood and cum that was just too thick to go down the drain with everything else that he's created over the past five years and given little ugly Mane's kind of antisocial history I would expect nothing less or more whatever so it seems like he's kind of selling this as a collection of leftovers and maybe that's not the worst thing in the world given that previous releases like third side of tape which I did love this project was kind of a long hulking mass of music from various parts of the little ugly main creative spectrum dabbling in numerous genres across this projects very long run time and maybe we'll see something as diverse over here still though I don't think that's necessarily going to satisfy some fans who I think are just kind of waiting for him to release like mr. thug isolation part to the breakout project that put the little ugly main project on the map in the first place but Oblivion access is not that and I'm totally fine with that I'm not really as big a fan of mr. thug isolation as a lot of people are I find it kind of gimmicky rather I think a lot of the Oblivion access material shares more in common with the sporadic rap tracks that you might have found on the plethora of very difficult to sift through long-winded long tracked projects that little ugly main has been dropping ever since the release of that album boom boom it's confusing I know and it's supposed to be ever little ugly mean blew up it seems like he's done everything in his power to make it difficult for people to get into his music another thing about this project that reminds me of previous little ugly main projects it's that it seems like Miller is kind of fooling around indulgently and just kind of making music for himself which hasn't always held his music back usually his ideas are so sharp they're so great they're so interesting that they don't really need incessant grooming to translate or be entertaining plus the rough quality of his music adds to the very grimy seedy shadowy character of it but I can't help but feel like with oblivion access we're really listening to Miller scrape the bottom of the barrel as hard as he can to string together these 13 tracks on this thing we have a number of very uninspired transitional moments that I do kind of like that weird trap Motown fusion on the song Leonard's lake that was kind of pretty or we have these really eyebrow-raising moments like on the very end of collapse and appear where we kind of have Microsoft Samantha reciting this cringe-worthy poem that sounds like it was lifted straight out of a goth kids diary the line about towel racks reminding him of pallbearers carrying caskets as well as the line about the woman gripping her purse when she sees him out of fear uh it's it's moments like this on the record that are just so edgy that I just can't help but not so we had these transitions we had these detours and then we have songs that are legitimate rap tracks with a straightforward B and a verse or two laced into it but these tracks are kind of brief not that fleshed out and they dissipate into the air pretty quickly once that verse or two is drop I do like the production generally it's noisy it's textured it's got an ominous vibe to it but the verses are either I don't know just really not up to any real quality standard that I could define or the verses the vocals are so smudgy and difficult to read that they're just really unsatisfying and another couple of things become really a harran one without all of the vocal and studio trickery it's really clear that Miller is a huge LP fan like a huge LP fan because it seems like he's borrowing a lot of his Cadence's and his flows straight from him which i think is a bit of a no-no for an artist who kind of puts forward this anti everything total context list void kind of narrative and for whatever reason the tracks on this project are kind of hitting me in a way that no other little ugly main project has and that's that it just kind of reeks of horrorcore and not even really good horror core like it's trying so hard to be the antithesis of anything good Pleasant or nice that it just kind of smells like a facade either that or it's coming from a place of such real and distasteful bitterness that even though it might be sincere it's still not likable sort of like how when he's blatantly claiming that he's never received an ounce of pleasure from sex on the song columns like okay even tracks that have more of a topical approach and seem really personal and descriptive and story like like the song drain counter just kind of reads like a b-side to me there are a few bright spots on here lyrical bright spots like at the start of song columns where he's kind of rapping about Internet age narcissism or on the song opposite lanes or I think he drops a really great line about how that third eye is just a bullet hole in your head but for every likable moment on here I think there's a spot that's kind of questionable and I think Miller kind of uses the murky lo-fi smudgy vibe of this project to kind of cover up the very obvious faults in these songs it's not that the thing is awful from beginning to end it's that he's very clearly not performing and writing up to the quality that he has on past projects which again I think isn't necessarily reflective of his talent as an artist on the whole I think it's mostly because this thing really is just an underwhelming b-sides collection that doesn't measure up to the rest of the ugly Mane discography if there is one track that I can praise musically lyrically and topically it's the closer here intent and purulent discharge where I think here Miller states the intentions and the mo of this project quite well it's philosophy and its history can kind of be summed up in the relationship that he has with his audience in that the audience is consistently reading a little bit too much into the music and expecting so many great things from it and really everything they see in it they kind of create themselves because in a mocking kind of way Miller sort of shoots back at his audience saying uh what does it mean what did he saying what is the message bug he's really making fun of his fans who were so desperate to find out what exactly this music is all about and so on and so forth but then later in the track he goes on to state that he's just rhyming words that sound good together and he's doing it to pass the time he's doing it because it feels good he's pretty much saying to the face of the people who were over hyping this project the platitudes here are empty sadly even with it being so blatantly said I think some people are still not going to get it and for me personally it's kind of always been obvious even from mr. thug isolation even though that project does have its merits it does kind of seem like he made something that became popular accidentally like he was just kind of fooling around and honestly I'm not looking to be jerked around by some half-hearted musical project from an anti socialite overall I'm kind of indifferent towards this thing I'm feeling a decent strong v on this project transition what did you think of this project did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it you have any Fantana little ugly mind forever 
9lnvCOLgQys,to just that just that just that just that he's the best hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for track or views where we talk about the latest in music we have a new single here for mr. Kanye West dropped while I was sort of vacation and doing my classics week thing but I'm going to talk about it now it's a little late but hey hey but better better to be later than be the the haters time to stop Kanye West rapper producer fashion designer father and more 2015 was a relatively quiet year for Kanye he was supposed to drop his swish album or at least he seemed to tease it so heavily everyone was expecting it at some point in the year but it just didn't happen but we did hear some songs from him like that four or five seconds collaboration with Rihanna and Paul McCartney and that all-day single on which people like Kendrick Lamar had co-writing credits but despite the popularity these songs had when they initially came out both of them have since kind of washed back into the ever-growing ocean of music that we are swimming through every day and in this ocean yay is a big fish which is why I think he needs to use this music platform that he has to continually promote what he is doing in other artistic mediums specifically fashion as he does in this song just to give a shout out on the production here we have southside and Metro boomin on the beat Metro boomin had a huge 2015 especially with his work that he did with future and that future and Drake collaborative project that dropped last year and on this song yeh directly references a song on that project jump man although I don't think he's really going at Drake not directly anyway and he's not going at future or anything like that instead he is going at another Jumpman Jumpman logo the jump man brand the Jordan shoe brand the subsidiary of Nike basically once again reminding us that Nike messed up not making shoes with him not signing with him not going forward with him it seems like even though yae has had success working with the it isn't pushing the easy shoe brand he's still kind of bitter at Nike for not doing it with him so we kind of need to sit through another series of bars where we are delivered yeas incredibly warped view of the situation saying Nike wouldn't have anything if it wasn't for them working with Drake uh yeah I mean they're working with a rapper who's even bigger than you what's the big deal I mean what would a Dida's have if they weren't working with you or what would any other shoe brand or clothing brand have that they weren't working with whatever incredibly famous spokesperson this isn't really a point another line on here where he talked about how they treat their employees like slaves which I'm not sure if they're talking about their spokespeople or maybe the people who they have working in factories making these shoes making this clothing which I mean I don't know overseas sweatshops are kind of a common practice in the American clothing industry every major American brand of clothing makes use of cheap overseas labor Dida's the brand that you work with Kanye is is really no different in that regard but then going on to talk about how they paid LeBron like a billion not to go work with another brand or just kind of stay on with Nike I'm sure they're happy with the relationship they have with LeBron and I'm sure LeBron is happy to have the billion I'm just not really sure what point he's trying to make here I mean you're talking about a niche specialized fashion shoe brand versus one of the most famous and successful clothing lines in athletic clothing history I don't know as I listen to Kanye talk shit about Nike on this track I can't help but feel like he's just doing it like as an adidas spokesman you know like obviously a lot of these criticisms of this shoe brand being weakened and not really being that great and so on and so forth can be applied to a lot of different clothing brands he's not going to Center those criticisms anywhere else other than on the brand that is in direct competition with the shoe brand that he is directly working with so we have all these lines about yay being unhappy with Nike and criticizing Nike and criticizing the Jordan and so on and so forth but then outside of that we have all these ridiculous lines that just should have gone straight into the recycle bin like that line about is everybody feel sad about or feel sympathetic toward Bill Cosby did he forget the name just like Steve Harvey and then that line about putting Grey Poupon on the DJ mustard that was pretty shameful again it's smart that Kanye is using this big platform that he has to promote other things that he's doing or trying to do but um how long is he going to have this platform if he keeps dropping tracks that are at such a low quality like this and he keeps making people wait for his next full-length album as much as some people may be kind of hyping this track up it's clearly a freestyle it's clearly not going to go on his new record hopefully I mean if it did it would be terrible it would be probably the worst track on the entire record not only because of the the lack of interesting lines but also the flow he has on this track is just like the same kind of generic southern flow that you could find on any single or any number of singles you could stumble across in a world star hip hop music video and he does a couple of vocal freak outs here and there I guess to kind of keep things semi interesting it's a weak track there's not really anything that great to say about it it's just kind of delusional self aggrandizement and anybody who is on board with this track is probably as delusional as EA is on this song and I think we can pretty much leave it there transition have you given this new Kanye single track freestyle a listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it a - why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music forever 
kXv60xh04aA,oh hey everyone Jonathan E Montano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Crowley's EP Hyperion New York progressive and technical and extreme metal band Crowell as' they have a new EP out over here I've enjoyed these guys for a while now they have numerous albums under their belt the last of which was their shortest and most direct release to date kind of sounded like I was listening to the band in the midst of some kind of transitional phase maybe they were no longer delivering that direct black metal sound that you might have found on their earlier releases even though there are experimental elements to these albums it's not like you're listening to true Norwegian black metal or anything like that but on this record it seemed like the band was diverting from some pretty key characteristics that made their music what it was up until this point the playing for one was getting flashy er more technical which is nothing new or different for two of the Bands key members mick bar and Colin Marston both of whom who have been in a number of metal projects that take a very technical and progressive approach to composition and performance and this move certainly made a lot of the songs on this album pretty engaging very dense very intricate but I I didn't care for how brief the album and a lot of the tracks on this thing were if there's one thing I enjoy so much about Krause's music previous to this album its how fleshed out how winding and how multifaceted a lot of their songs tend to be and this new Hyperion EP seems to kind of remedy that issue although maybe it's not a fix or a change of pace because allegedly according to the page where you can find this EP all of this material was recorded previous to you her still though this EP does seem to be a bit of a middle ground between this album and Krauss's previous LP years past matter one of my favorite albums of theirs and their entire discography the songs are longer they're expansive they have a little bit more meat and length on them in comparison to those you her saw so as a result I don't really have that many complaints about this EP it's short the production is little brittle at points but other than that it's somewhat satisfying the title track on here is incredibly brutal relentless it seems kind of liturgy inspired with its layers of harmonized very ear piercing wailing guitars that are sort of doling out these noodley little leads and riffs that kind of loop on these off-kilter grooves we I like the syncopated crescendos and bursts on the song guilt of time toward the middle point of the track and then there are some very sinister harmonized guitars on the back end of the song the bass really seems to be causing havoc a lot of the time in the mix it's not really providing that rhythmic counterpoint the bass usually does and many other rock recordings so it's kind of left to I don't know submerge underneath the guitars and just add some really weird dissonant harmonies and and ugly riffs the intro to the final track on this record with this kind of slow going B is a little drab but the track actually progresses into some of the most compelling guitar passages on the entire EP I would say the performance here is one of the most riveting and intense on the entire project and I love that little ambient synth swell toward the very end of the track kind of reminds me of stuff that I heard on years past matter kind of takes me back to the intergalactic feel that a lot of the songs on that record had overall I like this EP a lot I think it's really good but given that it was recorded prior to Crowell is's last album I'm not exactly sure how to take it I can't really expect the band to go back to this sound considering that they've already moved past it even though they're releasing this set of songs late I do like the flashy or more technical playing on this EP as I did on Crowell is's last album I just hope that the band's future material just sounds a little more I don't know fluidly composed even though the material on this EP is a little more active a little more menacing the songs the songwriting is coherent it's not disorienting and all over the place and disheveled like I thought a lot of those eager cuts were let's just say if you're into experimental black metal if you're into technical black metal if you're into relentless brutal black metal with a lot of guitar layers to it then you should most definitely check this EP out especially if you've already heard plenty of Krause's previous stuff and maybe this is slipped by you for some reason I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this thing transition have you given this EP a listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Crowell Asst forever 
-mQ5Rj2pyKM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new cage the elephant album tell me I'm pretty Cage the Elephant is a Kentucky alternative and garage rock band I didn't take them that seriously upon hearing their debut album or 2011's thank you happy birthday a record that I really did not care for an album where I kind of thought the band was taking a commercial approach to delivering some of that garage rock revivalism that was pretty popular throughout the 2000s oh and there were moments on this record where they were just like blatantly ripping off the Pixies however the band completely surprised me and even pleased me on their next full-length album melophobia an album that I cared for quite a bit it's like the band was no longer just kind of thriving off that garage rock revivalism but they were really throwing it back to the 60s and 70s and came through with a really ambitious and and vintage sound with some pretty lavish arranged instrumentation and the songwriting was pretty sharp or at least sharp enough to overcome a lot of the rock and roll cliches now with their latest album Cage the Elephant is still hanging in the past they're still pulling from bands like the stones the kinks the Beatles but I can't help but feel like on this record the band has already fully explored this sound on their last album or at least on their last record they explored it a little more ambitiously tell me I'm pretty in melophobia actually have quite a bit in common but if there's something that separates this record it's that it sounds a little rougher a little more claustrophobic as far as the instrumentation and the production think of like a dirty black lips album but without that kind of wild side that you typically expect from that band and this could have something to do with Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys coming on to produce this record and Dan's influence on this LP is especially prevalent on tracks like punching bag where I'm just really not sure where the sounds of the Black Keys end and the sounds the white stripes begin even though the band doesn't really sound like they're pushing forward in any degree on this new record over here they still do deliver some pretty catchy tracks like on the song that's alright baby that's right which is a little bit of cheesy fun it has these blaring buzzy lead guitar melodies the whole song sounds like I don't know some some like scooby doo chase montage music but in a good way in a good way it's very funny noisy playful garage rock and on the track cold cold cold the doctor can you help me please lines are kind of reinforced by the vintage sound of the guitars and the drums again that throwback nostalgic hit comes on strong with this record but it is a good and a fun tune with some very eerie keyboards and some kind of morbid lyrics as well it feels like a bit of a painted black and old-school R&B from the 50s fusion the simplicity of what Cage the Elephant is doing on this record might make this album more accessible it might make it more immediate but simultaneously I think it makes it a little less memorable to the band once again like on their older records is sounding like a copy of a copy it's just that what they're copying so blatantly on this record is is different than what they were copying on their earlier LPS and this could be kind of exacerbated by the fact that Dan Auerbach is on the controls producing this album because he is a guy who tends to where his influences very blatantly on his sleeves and not every cut on this record is dirty and grimy and sort of rough around the edges there are some cleaner cuts on this record which might do for adding to the variety of the album but I think on these cuts the grooves sound kind of passive and the instrumentation is just maybe a little more lifeless sort of like on the tracks weedy little gene where the lyrics on this track are actually just so quaint they're painful it just feels like the band wasn't really reaching that high with this record the one song here that feels like the the big expansive ballad too late to say goodbye reminds me quite a bit of come a little closer from gage the elephant's last album it's almost as if this LP over here sort of like a series of delayed after thoughts from melophobia and on the start of song trouble i hear that Pixies where where's my mind influence you guys could not let it go you just give up let it go but it's okay I'm not really sure if I could say much more about this album than that Cage the Elephant is once again fueling themselves off the fumes of their influences maybe not to the degree that they were early on but they've definitely reverted back to that a little bit on this new record and it seems like they didn't really care to out do what they did on melophobia either they're just kind of mining in that same headspace but digging up less gold in the process but I will say that this album has a lot of the same instrumental merits that melophobia did so if you are a big cage the elephant fan and you liked that album I don't see why this record wouldn't please you the band definitely pulled together a no frills no BS rock album but there's very little in terms of risk or excitement here either still it's a decent release I'm feeling a light the decent six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen if you did what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Anthony Fantana Cage the Elephant forever darkness hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here you know who it is and on the screen right now you're looking at our new website our brand new

QaMpiKZh1fc,and every night she's gonna make me shoot oh hey everyone prostitute Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of a kid a Radiohead classic review because America Radiohead is a widely known alternative and art rock band hailing from the UK they've put out a load of widely praised albums at least when it comes to the indie scene underground rock scene the music writer crowd this album has been repeatedly requested by viewers like you in the comments section for a future classic segment so hey I just had to oblige now this is one of Radiohead's two most popular records the album that preceded this one Ok Computer was kind of a last hurrah for the band it was the final album that the band would release in the 90s kind of closing out the decade that Radiohead broke through within thanks to singles like creep off of their debut full-length album Pablo honey which thanks to all of the musical progression Radiohead has made over the course of their career a lot of fans don't really look back onto that album very fondly mostly because the alt rock and the grunge sound Radiohead was playing with in the 90s was sort of a trend that they evolved out of down the road and okay computer was the last taste of this sound that Radiohead and their fans would have before they would go into a more abstract and experimentally an electronic direction with records like kid a and when it comes to measuring up kid a and okay computer this is the record that I prefer I'm not really a big fan of Pablo Honey either and I think a lot of Radiohead's 90's material after that was just too sluggish and mid paced and melancholy to be exciting for me from beginning to end though they're certainly highlights in Radiohead's 90's discography again it was really the 2000s that I found to be the more exciting era in Radiohead's career in rainbows and neezy AK and especially over here kid a and on this LP Radiohead would be fusing the very sad and melancholy songwriting that they were known for with a lot of other music style shades of IBM like on the song IDEO Tech there's also the track tree fingers in the middle of this LP which is kind of this nice little serene beautiful ambient interlude so the band really diversifies their sound on this record but there are moments where they play to their strengths as well like on the track how to disappear completely which I think could have fit pretty snugly into that okay computer track listening if not for the very sour and ominous strings looming in the background filling up the space around this very skeletal strip back acoustic ballad and there are plenty of tracks on here like morning bail which are undeniably rock songs at their core though they do have a really strong emphasis on repetition sort of in this crowd rock Ian sense maybe even a little bit of a Velvet Underground or some Talking Heads influence there too but that's the thing about the rhythms on this album the grooves on this album they're either electronic and sequenced or if they are performed live they are delivered in the tightest most looped performance as possible and considering this it's not surprising to hear that in interviews Thom Yorke saw quite a bit of merit in albums like DJ shadows introducing or the more introspective side of electronic music in the 90s because certainly elements of those things show up on here big time kid a provides a really interesting bridge between these worlds of experimental and art rock and electronic music from the end of this album to the start which kicks off with some incredibly icy enveloping synthesizers right at the opening and everything in its right place with Thom Yorke sort of beckoning with his very high nasal falsetto and they're all these really weird creepy robot vocals reversed hanging in the background it's like I'm being invited into this world of electronic and organic in this world I think is also depicted on the cover art of this album as well we have all these mountaintops what seems like kind of a very natural landscape in one sense but everything is just way too angular and digital to be completely organic this album to me is just about filtering human sadness and human emotions through this synthetic lens like on the title track where we get these very blinky spacious key something that sounds like it would have turned up on a Jonny Greenwood soundtrack or something and then over that these strange warbling robot vocals which kind of have this Tambor of like a drive through speaker box I don't think the vocals on this track and this could be blasphemy aged all that well over the past 15 years I think they sound kind of silly to me at this point though I do think they bring the concept of this track and this album home really well and I can't deny that the patient beats and very pretty Keys on this track did a great job of setting the tone for a lot of the electronic and acoustic fusions that a lot of underground music would deliver to us over the next 10 years the track is a cool crossroads of man and machine and it glides into the next song really nicely the very heavy and gratifying national anthem this track really picks the momentum up on the album it really needed it I love this track I love the head bobbing bassline tuned nananananana the drumbeat has kind of a breakbeat style to it Tom York comes through two slices through all of this stuff with this very nasal falsetto his vocals have some weird feedback some kind of strange tinny effect on them that reminds me a lot of the robot vocals or the previous track but it's almost as if Thom Yorke has become a little more human on this next song so we're seeing some kind of thematic progression here with how the vocals are presented to us and then with the blurting horns and the layers of weeping tones that kind of thicken up the mix as the song progresses the track it's really overwhelming powerful heavy and then quickly after this very intense high we are brought to a depressing low on the song how to disappear which I mentioned earlier in the review this track is just powerfully sad as many of the songs on this album are but there are little shimmers of light that poke through the depression of this album in the second half of the record we have the track optimistic which despite its very dreary rock instrumentation there's a lyrical mantra that sticks out where Thom Yorke is saying the best you can is good enough the best you can is good enough it's almost as if this song is trying to pull itself out of its self-imposed depression and stress the ascending bassline on this track as well as the instrumentation that gets thicker as the song moves along is really beautiful it's another overpowering moment on the album for me and there's a little outro guitar line it's really powerful drum fills too toward the finish of this track that I like a lot that's just so Britt rock all the way this track transitions really nicely into the song in limbo which is a very repetitive track but there certainly reasoning behind that repetition the swirling guitar arpeggios and the diddling keyboards and the mantra on this track about living in a fantasy it's like the track has kind of placed us into a dream state right in the midst of this album and we are woken up right after this track only to find that the world has turned cold and calculated once again like toward the beginning of the album on the song idiot Ecch where the very robotic and sequenced electronic synthesizers and cushon on this tracker matched really nicely with Tanya works vocals which I think are some of the most humanized and raw vocals on the entire record and I love motion picture soundtrack as the finish of this record I love a song that provides a nice strong ending and instrumentally this track feels like a very warm goodbye which is a nice change of pace given just how powerfully dreary so much of the music was up until this point but the lyrics of the track reveals a darker side to this little ditty closing the album out the feelings of this track the lyrics of this track are fueled by red wine and sleeping pills and sad movies and the track closes out with Thom Yorke singing that he'll see us in the next life is this track some kind of suicide note is he saying that he's missing someone he's going to see that person in the afterlife eventually is he just saying goodbye to this character who he's playing as in this track or is he saying goodbye to his audience until the next album this moment and a lot of other moments on the record can be interpreted in a myriad of different ways but what's important about a lot of the tracks on this record is that the emotions are strong they're potent you know you just got to deal with them and you know it's it's just not all about down trodden feelings either there are quite a few moments on this record that are kind of mind-bending and psychedelic - and abstract but one of the great things about Radiohead and I think this has been one of the keys to their success over the years it doesn't indulge an experimentation to the point where the music is difficult to listen to or appreciate it's pretty accessible and while yeah that's going to turn some people off because sure Radiohead they're not the most adventurous band on the planet I think it can really be a challenge to make a record that not only try something different but also appeals to people you know and if you're going to appeal to people that means that there's going to have to be at least a little bit of compromise there in the experimentation process I think there is such a thing as restraint and I think that that thing is significant and I think kid a puts that significance as well as a lot of other things on display the music the mix the sound the instrumentation the the vocals just everything is so nice about this help of and it's a record that I think is certainly worthy of the praise that it's been getting all of these years 15 years still going strong a lot of people still heavily into this record I think it's still a genre pusher I think it's still a boundary pusher I think it's still emotionally intoxicating and I think a cinematic experience too as far as albums go and I think that's about it for all the nice things I have to say about this record so thanks for watching this classic review for this album transition I hope you're doing well and that was the Radiohead review ladies and gentlemen we're going to be getting back into our regularly scheduled review programming momentarily so just hang in there it's all getting back on track you're the best forever 
ZNzEdcOMSiI,hey everyone secretly white anno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a classic review a classic whoo of teen DJ shadows introducing mr. DJ shadow is a West Coast DJ and producer and this is his debut album mr. shadow is essentially one of instrumental hip hop's true trailblazers not only did he create a smooth entrancing and textured ode to the hip-hop instrumental on this album but from what I understand this is actually one of popular musics first almost entirely sample-based albums which is pretty cool because most if not all the samples on this record were lifted off of vinyl albums bought in record shops would you know people used to do that maybe I'll buy one of them vinyls one day see what all the hubbub is about if you do a bit of digging on the Internet you can find a full list of all the samples on this record but sort of just you know lightly gazing over it there is a pretty wide array of source material on this thing people like jazz fusion drummer greats Billy Cobham as well as modern favorites at least you know modern for the time the Trekker came out Metallica Bjork psychedelic and experimental rock and progressive rock bands such as Nirvana not Cobain and company the UK Nirvana as well as tangerine Dream and Georgio's on this thing - giorgio and even though instrumental hip hop and turntablism up until this point the art form up until this point in the mid 90s influenced this album heavily DJ shadow takes that Foundation and doesn't just kind of recreate it he actually goes into other stylistic directions with it moodier more open and vast and sometimes kind of ambient directions really setting the tone for the more atmospheric approach a lot of hip hop instrumentals modern hip hop instrumentals take today and if that's a bit of a stretch for you this album is at a precursor or a significant moment in time for the very warped and experimental approach that a lot of underground West Coast producers showcase even today and this album's creativity is so great it even transcends the hip-hop genre because this album for sure influenced plenty of introspective electronic music producers even the boys in Radiohead thought it was fantastic upon its release its release in 1996 which is kind of crazy to think of because of how progressive this album is stylistically and and texturally maybe not technically I mean there's certainly not a whole lot of flash to this album and thanks to sort of modern music editing technology there is sort of I guess a rudimentary Ness about the music on this album it doesn't sort of have that high level of detail a lot of production today has so in one sense even though this record does sound a little dated it's simultaneously for its time was kind of a sign of things to come and at least not now I don't think it's age really works against it because still today introducing finds an incredible amount of power in very simple sample layering and transitions and rhythms this record isn't really that much about flash anyway it's really more of just a big gorgeous mood record hypnotic repetitions head bobbing grooves pristine cavernous reverb melodies and some wonderful just humming just relaxing alluring tones which again is part of why this album sort of transcends that whole instrumental hip hop label and sort of dips a bit into electronic music down tempo trip-hop there's over an hour of material on this record it spans 13 tracks some of which are broken up into a few parts and intros and transitions and builds or just beat shifts and a lot of the tracks on this LP span five six seven nine minutes we are talking some pretty ambitious lengths here for instrumental hip hop introducing is peppered with a few little interlude tracks here and there to kind of lighten the mood like the intro track which features some fantastic scratching as well as why hip-hop sucks in 96 it's the money the problems worse now and again if you give this thing a listen with the instrumental hip-hop tag don't go into this thing necessarily expecting a series of just boom bap II just hard-hitting hardcore flavored instrumentals what you're going to hear on this thing are just like vast atmospheres complemented with very punctuated Bumi and just hulking slow rhythms and some very pretty samples as well as some you know kind of strange vocal snippets and the fact that this album is going to go in that direction is very clear from the first full track on this thing building steam with a grain of salt which features this massive be pretty straightforward hip-hop grew from the drums on this thing but the very moody piano arpeggios on this track tell a very different story they feel incredibly soundtrack music inspired like I'm going to be watching some kind of hip-hop flavored horror film and the very resonant bass on this thing the eerie background vocals and the vocal snippets they all blend together very nicely and again soundtrack music is most definitely definitely an inspiration for shadow on this record I mean just look at Giorgio on this album and I believe the soundtrack from Prince of Darkness is actually sampled at least a few times in the track listing here to the pace of this record picks up on the next track here the number song with some buzzing bass in a very kind of low fiber it'll crispy drum be at least it kind of feels like a buzzing bass either that are like a buzzing organ or something like that I feel like I'm listening just this really loud just a very grainy organ rock Jam and I love the funk breakdown in the middle of this track too it's a really nice change of pace and touch and change ups are a pretty significant part of the song change laying which is one of the more subdued tracks on here but it feels like this really fluid in the moment jam between this ever-changing drum beat and the more melodic samples that shadow pulls together in the mix here too and the very eerie guitar leads that pop in at the end of this track are a beautiful touch as well they sort of glide this song from kind of feeling like this very slowed down chill laid-back funk jazz to something just way more intergalactic just rocketing off or maybe just floating up angelically into space this records centerpiece is the nine minute cut stem slash long stem slash transmission - and on this cut DJ shadow really just completely moves away from hip-hop in a sense and embraces both soundtrack music and progressive synth music I mean this track sounds like the opening music to a really epic battle in this just harrowing tale of I guess intergalactic sci-fi war not only do the drums on this track had this just distorted just punchy kind of industrial drum machine tone to them but there's all these plucked arpeggios all over this track some some very haunting background tones that kind of feel like they're they're orchestral a little bit hanging back there and the drumbeats on this track eventually work up to a very fast and speedy pace really just blasting the song off into this very tense explosive moment we go from a track that just feels like it is not of this world to these tracks that feel I don't know just a little more playful and a sense song organ-donor which funnily enough samples in organ it's really maybe the only track on this thing that I have an issue with a big issue with and that's that I just wish it was longer my tie was longer and with this track of the song mutual slump I think DJ Shadow does a great job here and across this record of kind of contrasting these slower more laid-back tracks with something a little more hard-hitting and just in your face because on mutual slump I mean the very fat overblown kick drum on this track as well as the screaming saxophone now this helped these final moments kicks off with the track midnight in a perfect world which is really a perfect pristine piece of trip-hop are getting these very laid-back easygoing hip-hop flavor rhythms together with these distant very beautiful and gorgeous female vocals and it is one of the most beautiful tracks in the tracklisting here and of course we kind of kick things up a notch once again on the song napalm brain scatter brain which is this I guess bit of alien funk from another dimension the drum beyond this thing is so tense and the bass which is incredibly big incredibly warm actually brings a really nice groove to this drum beat and this track actually makes an awesome and very fluid and subtle progression toward this very speedy break beat I mean DJ Shadow instantaneously goes from from what sounds like the west coast to the UK just in a matter of seconds with just the flavor of the rhythms on this track closing track on here is fine I mean it's it's maybe one of the more middling tracks on the LP here it's a little vanilla in a sense it's a you know a bit of a jazzy hip-hop instrumental and it's it's very pleasant it's very sweet on the ears although I will say that the vocal snippets that are kind of worked into this track do feel kind of unsettling in a sense of but nightmarish I will give this track kudos for sounding incredibly dreamlike for its time though overall I mean this is a fantastic LP again DJ shadow one of the Trailblazers of this genre and this album I most definitely think a sign of things to come for when it comes to just more experimental and adventurous approaches to hip hop production DJ shadow not only bent the rules of this style of music when he was making this record but he also in a refreshing way didn't feel held back by this style of music and and felt very comfortable and very at ease at least from what I can hear because of the creativity of this record and the way that he kind of embraces these other musical art forms he wasn't afraid to dip his toes into some soundtrack music into some very dramatic trip-hop music into just some weird out there kind of progressive synth or ambient type stuff and each time it's done pretty freakin well and it's pulled together into a what I think is very evocative textured very very sound rich record this thing's a classic you already know that that's why I'm reviewing it it's almost 20 years old and still sounds fantastic in my opinion if you haven't given this thing a listen please do if you already have I'm glad you have and I hope you enjoy it as much as me if not more and uh yeah that's it you're the best transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what album is classic - I don't know any others this is the only classic album I know forever 
IgSqLCEW58E,everybody hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a little classic review of the NWA album Straight Outta Compton n.w.a Compton based hip hop group has their sophomore fo length LP and there's quite a bit of history behind this album one this LP kicked off the careers of some pretty iconic hip hop artists MC Ren eazy-e dr. Dre Ice Cube and this record also put Compton on the map as well as the West Coast as a presence in hip hop music of course there were west coast hip hop artists that preceded this album also we have to make note of the NWA album that came out before this LP titled under NWA and the posse a noticeably clumsier hip hop album in terms of flows lyrics and production kind of demo quality it's not something I recommend checking out unless you're you know just kind of have a morbid curiosity for this group Plus this helm doesn't really have that cold-blooded mean mug an attitude that Straight Outta Compton has as well especially if you look at tracks like scream and and fat girl which are pretty playful and silly and while we're mentioning early West Coast hip hop artists let's not forget about world class wrecking crew which was essentially the group Dre was in before he and Ice Cube linked up up and the third thing about this LP that makes it a significant piece of hip hop history is that it helped the genre become the controversial hard-as-nails style of music that it is today with a level of violent and sexual content in their music videos in their songs that turned a lot of heads angered a lot of censors concerned a lot of parents good children let's look at the year again here the year this album drops 1988 hip hop music the ball is essentially in full motion it is rolling hip hop music already has had its forefathers it has its established icons that would become classic years down the road people like Afrika Bambaataa Eric being rock him Grandmaster Flash in the Furious Five it has also charted on the pop charts numerous times thanks to artists such as Kurtis Blow and Run DMC LL Cool J as well as the Beastie Boys who recently no gir not shy about sampling at least a few times on this album so hip hop music was reaching an age where it started to diversify and you had other artists coming in from different walks of life bringing different points of view there were less rules because artists like NWA were taking risks and breaking those rules and I sort of see NWA as being a part of this trend in hip hop in the late 80s to make music that was a little gritty er a little more realistic whether that be through a political or a socially conscious message such as with artists like Public Enemy or Boogie Down Productions but in the case with NWA that that grit that realism manifested itself in sex drugs violence and unapologetically nasty attitudes toward bitches as well as authority figures America loves women and they love police officers so once you start showing a lack of respect toward those things you're gonna Kirk some people but America loves to other things as well we love outlaws and we love underdogs and NWA was both as people kind of stood in awe of how nasty and violent and rebellious some of their lyrics were this album helped speed up what was essentially an already running machismo arms race in hip-hop music I mean once gangster rap and hardcore hip-hop on the East Coast kind of came out in full swing just no-holds were barred but when you look at NWA now with the past 20 years of hip hop music in frame they might not seem as hardcore as they were when they once came out and tracks on straight out of Compton like express yourself sort of drive this point home the song has a pretty positive vibe and message and is backed by a very sunny funk sample even dr. Dre as he is rapping on the song he raps the whole length of the track spits about suckers tickling him pink to his stomach it's an adorable moment so yeah away this album has been kind of dated by advancements in the fields of aggression as well as course language in hip-hop music I can't really think of the last critically acclaimed hip-hop album that has so frequently used the word ding-a-ling it was the 80s the flows and the rhyme schemes on this album were kind of rudimentary when compared to some of the more technical deliveries that would turn up in the 90s though this album does have its moments like with Ice Cube on parental discretion is advised or MC Ren on if it ain't rough today me and dr. Dre and DJ yella while they did have some great sample based production on this album it wasn't really as skilled as what the Beastie Boys would be doing next year with the Dust Brothers on Paul's Boutique and I don't really consider this album to be as hard-hitting or as dense as what Public Enemy was doing earlier that year still though moments on this album like the title track are so incredibly hard-hitting I mean for its time a banger beat and also when you go to just the next track on here the police the message on this song is I guess disturbingly accurate for today's social climate and while there are other rap albums during this decade that I enjoy at least just a little bit more this is one of the few LPS that I find it just impossible to imagine hip-hop music without this album's existence Straight Outta Compton is a record that is daring its influential and it's just simply put pivotal to rap music history so to sort of talk about the content of the songs on this album we have the opening the title track which I said incredible start to this album I love the hard-hitting just trunk knocking drums on this track as well as the blaring horns in the background - and the little guitar phrase that turns up a little more prominently in the middle of this song and it's just a Killer Bee and I think in a way kind of a sign of what was to come in the 90s once grittier forms of hip hop came out in full swing as far as what this track is doing lyrically we are told we're about to witness the strength of Street knowledge and we have Ice Cube kickin this track off who is essentially NW waise standout lyricist and invoice in my opinion not to say the cubes lyrics and just the lyrics on this album in general are going to blow you away with deeper meanings and double entendre x' or anything like that NWA wasn't really showcasing the most technical skill or wordplay in the 80s if you really want that I mean check out an Eric B in rock him album but what NWA didn't have in technical skill they made up for in just raw aggression and brutality which is what makes this verse stand out because there were few rappers in the 80s that sounded meaner than Ice Cube on this track after him we have MC Ren re n spells Ren but him raw to me MC Ren he holds his own on this album he kind of for me is a bit of a middle ground between and eazy-e he is a little more brutal and straight to the point though not quite as I guess oversimplified is what some of Eazy E's lyrics can be and also his voice too because eazy-e has the most high-pitched voice on this entire album which really makes him stick out we have eazy-e on this track coming after MC Ren putting out lines like I'll smother your mother and make your sister think I love her lines the innocence these days anyway are kind of funny but again I mean you have to kind of put in perspective this was the 80s and what made these lyrics stick out were that they were incredibly offensive for their time later in his verse we have eazy-e essentially just showing no sadness whatsoever as he brings up imagery of a woman getting shot and you know he doesn't care about a bitch he's not a sucker of course NWA went on to make the song bitch is a bitch where they kind of you know put a separator between okay when we say bitches we're talking about bitches not women whether or not you buy into that is is really up to you it's songs like this that got NWA in hot water because they kind of blur the lines between okay is this entertainment is it fiction is it sensationalized does it glorification is it real is it the truth is it someone's everyday life I like to kind of think of this LP as a little calm a and a little column B because while I'm sure Ice Cube never had a rap sheet that was as bad as Charles Manson's this record does address some real issues and if you find it hard to accept what this album is trying to say in a social sense just because there is violence on this album maybe because of the wider social implications of songs like this depicting violence maybe in a not that way um you know really it takes more than for something to be on a record to get someone to do something bad and add so again while there is violence on this album important issues are addressed as well such as on the song the police which like songs before as such as here comes the judge or Judge Dredd or cocaine blues is a song that takes place in a courtroom and we have eazy-e Ice Cube MC Ren sort of detailing the situation that led them to the point where they are kind of you know saying their piece in court and it's not a story song or anything like that I mean often the verses on this track kind of devolve into violent gunplay and hatred toward discriminatory cops but it doesn't really make it any less entertaining I also have Ice Cube on this track saying that cops are just assuming that black males are selling narcotics which is obviously an assumption a police officer should not be making but at least in the case of NWA they did for their time giveth Ora T figures reason to be skeptical of who they were and what they were doing they were so good at blurring the lines between fantasy and reality there's actually one line on this album where Ice Cube says you hope I don't really mean this I don't really mean what I'm saying on this song on these songs gangsta gangsta is the next track on here where Ice Cube really holds his own for most of the song we have easy you just coming in at the very end of the track where one of these synth leads pop in underneath him that would be a defining characteristic to a G funk in the 90s Ice Cube on this track is absolutely ruthless the beat hits hard there's some old-school drum machines on this track but there is like this a funky tar sample that really smoothes it out very nicely there is a very prominent caris one sample on the hook here it's not about a salary it's all about reality lyrically we're getting a lot of anecdotes here a lot of gunplay with the song if it aint rough with MC Ren it's essentially just kind of a maybe the sequel to this gangsta gangsta track we kind of have an Ice Cube song here with a little bit of eazy-e and here we're just having an MC Ren song which has a very similar sonic build to in terms of how the sample works into the drum machine and while there are some silly lyrics on this track as well where we have MC Ren saying that he'll grab your girl to a go take a nap with him on this track with many other lines on here too we sort of see him portraying himself as being a villain all in black most definitely one of the earliest MCS that I have heard sort of taking the bad guy role and just really embracing it we have parental discretion is advised is with a Z and this is the first time we have dr. Dre popping up for a for a full verse on a track the doc actually kicks the song off with a nice intro and this track it doesn't have a huge hook or anything like that it's drums it's lyrics it's a bunch of emcees playing off of one another lyrically this is the first track on this album that is just the essence of hip hop at its core express yourself that I mentioned earlier comes up after this and and like I said it's it's really a standout on this album in that it has a different and much more positive vibe when you compare it to the other cuts on this album and even though this track sticks out like a sore thumb I think it only does so because it doesn't play into the narrative of what the media sort of portrays NWA as and and what fans portray NWA as you know the the hardest most dangerous music group in the world if you can kind of just dip out of that tag for a second what we essentially have here is just a really nice genuine hip hop song with a nice sentiment and message to it now the second half of this LP after express yourself I think a lot of the songs on on this half I'm just guessing might be a little older than what was on the first half because I think a lot of the the drum sounds in just the the production styles on this record and the rap styles - are just a little more dated the first half of this record feels like it could have come out three years from wine whereas the second half just you know really feels like 80s Golden Age hip hop music you have Compton's in the house which is essentially a posse cut where Compton is stepping to challenging other rap posses putting themselves above everyone else in terms of skill and talent and ability you have I need the one which is kind of in the same vein of some previous tracks the Beastie Boys she's crafty or Public Enemies sophisticated bitch showing just general distrust toward women and romantic relationships because these ladies they just want his money whereas I guess he just kind of wants sex his flow on this track seems kind of k RS s k-- and the song dope man even though it may have kind of a very simple skeletal beat to it is one of my favorite tracks on this album because it's just kind of a very realistic and gritty portrayal of a heartless and completely untrustworthy drug dealer this song is not glorifying drug dealers as much as it is saying that the drug dealer is not your friend he is doing you no favors a detail that kind of gets overlooked as people focusing on how controversial NWA was back in the day and the song quiet on the set it's definitely one of the louder and more aggressive tracks on this album it's not a bad addition to the record but it's it's hardly a closer to this album it just kind of feels like one more track in a line of songs that that don't really flow together in any kind of thematic way you know they do have recurring themes in the lyrics and they do have a similar aesthetic and sound but I guess this album at the end of the day still just kind of feels like just a collection of tracks you know not like a fully formed record then in the same way that like dr. Dre's the chronic might feel like a fully formed record ordered but still this mere collection of tracks helped mark what was a rift a musical and cultural rift in rap music and personally I still think it makes for an entertaining listen today these are essentially my thoughts on Straight Outta Compton love this record and tastic hip-hop record great old-school hip-hop record yeah it's a little nasty it's a little mean but I enjoy it for that and I know that there are other hip-hop records that have different messages and and different types of lyrical content so if I'm looking for something else I'll go listen to that if I'm looking for something mean and in-your-face and you I will listen to this cool cool transition if you give this album a listen what do you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it it's classic review you know with everything everything's cool everything's sweet you're the best love you forever 
LjNtySatBm4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a classic review of the Slynt album spiderland kentucky rock band this is their 1991 album sophomore LP and it is one of the most pivotal albums in underground rock music Slynt has an incredibly short discography just a few albums their debut LP they recorded with Steve Albini maybe three albums if you count the record many of the band members insolent release when they were in an entirely different band they follow this album up with a little EP that's actually pretty awesome but still despite how little Slynt songs there are their music has been incredibly popular and impactful some of the earliest and most pivotal pieces of music in math rock as well as post-hardcore the band's tendency toward repetition and growing musical intensity leaves a lot of people throwing the post-rock tag on them as well but for me personally this record has always been a difficult album to define genre wise the odd time signatures and jagged grooves on this record exemplified through the drum beats and the riffs might align with math rock but I wouldn't really say it's a defining characteristic of this record maybe more of a subtle detail you might eat up as you are diving into the inner workings of these grooves and the music here are certainly influenced by Punk as well as hardcore punk but only in the sense that the the sounds on this record are really bare they're stripped back they're very direct and straightforward outside of that there isn't a lot of throttling explosive viscera on this record a lot of these songs are very long they're very winding they're very patient this is not your average rock album in terms of feel the music here is very still it's very hypnotic I would say it's reserved most of the time and when it does manage to get loud the music just turns into an intense descent into depression there are very dry thin emotionally drained guitars and bass guitar all over this record writing very rigid grooves maybe until there's a blast of distorted chords kind of breaks the endlessly growing tension a lot of the time I actually find the drumming of Britt Wofford to be way more expressive than the guitars he put some killer fills into this album I really think his fills are very dramatic and purposefully so against the kind of stiff guitars and bass that Ethan buckler and David Pajo deliver throughout a majority of this album this LP has a very basic and simple but very interesting instrumental character but a lot of the time it's really about Brian McMahon's vocals for me I think his vocals really set the group apart from other artists who might have been doing similar things around this time and even though the guitars the bass by themselves are certainly drained taxed the vocals really help bring that emotion home a lot of the time Brian is delivering this deadpan standoffish whisper quiet spoken word he could be delivering poetry or telling stories and this actually draws me in more than it turns me off I think it conveys a certain kind of expression to add vocals this quiet and the fact that there is a lot of reverb here there's a lot of overdubbing cluttering the mix if you just lean in and listen closely the vocals are pretty readable in a way I actually find this vocal approach to be kind of eerie and twisted a lot of the time so with this record basically you're getting this rock instrumentation executing this fantastic tension building repetition and it's peppered with some great drum fills some interesting lyrics and some very simple but effective guitar leads and phrases again this album has a different emotional character than most rock LPS and there are so few albums out there exactly like it despite its popularity and I think that's partially because this record doesn't come down to just its compositional elements its emotional character is really important I don't think there are a lot of artists out there brave enough or maybe even capable enough to come out with a record this blatantly dismal as far as the content on this record we are getting six tracks they run up to 40 minutes and time they're each like you know five to eight minutes each and the record kicks off at the very patient breadcrumb trail a song guided by this plucked ringing harmonic guitar line and lyrically the song starts off with a pretty unassuming story if you're not familiar with the record the vocals might seem kind of off-putting as to how quiet they are they might not seem like a focus but really you should be zooming in on these lyrics and it's a tale about I guess being at a carnival a theme park a sideshow coming across a fortune teller our protagonist seems to turn down having his fortune told and instead opts for going on the roller coaster which might in fact be symbolic because as soon as this part is over the guitars explode and we're getting all this real rollercoaster imagery which is being delivered against the supremely slow heavy sinister riffs that make old-school Sabbath's seem like up B the song is pretty nightmarish after this point eventually coasts into a really dissonant interlude and circles back around to the very tame and reserved plucked harmonic riff that kicked the entire song off this song is like being transported suddenly to a really horrible place and then you just find yourself back where you started and the next track on here actually is a quite obviously nightmarish the song Nosferatu man there is an awesome screaming guitar lead that plays throughout much of this song really evil stuff we get lyrics about this Nosferatu man living in a castle trying to please his queen drinking blood lyrically instrumentally this is definitely one of the more straightforward tracks on the record but still it is kind of abstract the point of this song and the point of breadcrumb trail the moral of the story as it were isn't exactly obvious or anything like that I don't necessarily get these stories because I don't think you're supposed to get them in an obvious way however I do feel them I do think they are emotionally stirring as is the track done Amen which is one of the more reserved songs on here mostly acoustic a lot of the time you're getting this fast but very quiet guitar strumming on the track as we get this story the inner thoughts of one Don who seems to have stepped outside for a moment at a party to kind of collect his thoughts and he seems to be kind of suffering from some serious social anxiety and the lyrics get pretty detailed as to what exactly he's focusing in on and is making him so miserable he ends up leaving the party going back home I guess angry or depressed he wakes up the next morning looks at himself in the mirror takes responsibility maybe this is kind of a turning point where he decides he's gonna try to fix these problems and it's kind of surprising there's no wallowing in one self-pity on this track there are no rash decisions made or anything like that it's like a mature decision was made in a rock song whoa but keep in mind with this track and other songs on here there's no big catchy hook or anything like that you're talking about mostly linear song structures that are very repetitive and you know really it's the story and it's the lyrics that are kind of providing variation in moving the song from point A to point B this is very quiet this is very subtle this is very introspective music and the album continues with that theme on the song washer with this twinkly sad little descending guitar line against the bass and drums and we're getting this tale of what seems like somebody saying goodbye to their lover maybe as they are asleep maybe it's a note it doesn't feel like the person the protagonist is talking to is really there maybe he's talking to this person in his head from beyond the grave I'm not really sure but he is saying goodbye and in a really dramatic way it doesn't seem like you know he's just going out to the store or anything like that this may be a final goodbye or maybe a goodbye saying that he's going to go he needs to leave and then he doesn't know when he'll be back and after this goodbye has established the lyrics really focus on the darkness and the loneliness this person might be sort of having to deal with the fear that they might be experiencing after this person sort of disappears into the night this is also the longest track in the record here and has one of the biggest crescendos toward the end of the song to the album coasts into a little instrumental and then with the final track makes way for my favorite song on the entire record good morning captain the tiny shrunk down eerie and tinny guitar chords that kick this album off are a fantastic contrast to the numbing bassline the guitars and the drums versus here are so incredibly quiet and it really sets the stage for my favorite set of lyrics on the album we get lines about quite literally a captain of a ship who seems to have lost his ship in a storm and now he's facing death everyone's gone I'm just assuming he's totally alone now and these seem to be his last words his last thoughts is he just talking to himself talking in general and as if the music couldn't get any quieter it does just before this explosive wall of guitars just changes the flavor of the song entirely and just turns really really just sad it seems like our protagonist here is talking to maybe someone he wishes he could see one final time before he dies right here in the middle of the ocean saying really twisted twisted stuff phew rock albums in my opinion exemplify the word tortured in the truest sense but what I think is so great about this album is that the way it goes about expressing those feelings is either different from what other rock bands might do it doesn't seem like it just focuses on oh my feelings are this my feelings are this I feel tortured me personally me me me me me me me me me me me me me Slynt isn't really obvious like that and it's part of what makes this album so enjoyable there's something so simple and bare and skeletal about the music on this album and yet there's something really mysterious and kind of shadowy about it too but if anything is for sure with this record it's that it's a melancholy is incredibly strong incredibly potent and I think that's why uh this album is so fan diddly tastic if you've given this album listen what do you think of it is it one of your favorites of all time why do you love it so much and um what classics do you think I should consider reviewing next you're the best transition I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I yeah I hope you have a good day and um yeah Anthony Fantana Slynt spiderland forever 
apXInrB6Bh8,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a nice sweet classic review of Bob Dylan's highway 61 revisited this is the sixth full-length LP from mr. Robert Alan Zimmerman aka Bob Dylan a significant record for modern music as well as this contemporary folk singers discography for a few reasons for one one of his most seminal hits is on this record like a rolling stone this album also featured one of the most heart-wrenching moments and popular music Ballad of a Thin Man and this is also the record where from front to back nearly Dillon went electric meaning he was backing his singing his harmonica and guitar playing on this LP with electric guitars with drums rock instrumentation a handful of rock musicians were actually brought in to perform in the sessions on this record this is something that in the past Dylan had only flirted with be it in the live setting or on his last full-length LP we're only half of the album featured rock instrumentation on it while the other half was acoustic folky and dipping his toes into this pool wasn't something Bob Dylan's fans all accepted mostly because his popularity had been born out of the folk music revival of the 60s specifically in Greenwich Village New York where Bob Dylan would routinely perform if you want to read more about this era of his life you should actually pick up the book Bob Dylan Chronicles Volume one I don't know where the next two chronicles are been waiting ten years but if you are a Bob Dylan fan or if you're even just slightly interested in this era of music he tells some you know very interesting war stories about himself other artists that he played alongside in this area and just you know this is this early part of his life now at the time this new wave of folk music you could call it wasn't just about celebrating new folk music singers it was also about sort of maintaining an American folk tradition Dylan in his years and most likely even today was obsessed with American folk singer Woody Guthrie he had this incredible reverence for him as did a lot of fans of Dylan's early work so for Dylan to go for making these socially aware politically charged acoustic ballads on a record like the times they are a-changin to going with rock instrumentation on highway 61 revisited it's not hard to see that some fans would kind of think he's going astray and losing the narrative of this folk music revival and it was not just the inclusion of electric guitar that were turning some fans off Dylan's lyrics at this point in his career seemed way less tangible seemed way less real his lyrics turned more abstract and surreal he was taking less direct jabs at politicians and instead was providing listeners with this kind of colorful strange beautiful and sometimes unsettling imagery but when you read further into verses on this record and later records as well it wasn't really that Dylan's stopped paying attention to the world around him but I think his critiques on the world at large just became a little bit more subtle even though for some this LP might have been a hard pill to swallow at the time this is ultimately the move that needed to be made not only for Dylan's career but for modern music in general because not only is this a great LP but this album helped solidify folk rock as an art form before this album there were certainly examples of folk rock music take a band like the animals for example which were taking a very popular British Invasion type rock sound for its time and applying that to the traditional folk song House of the Rising Sun or even the birds who the same year that Bob Dylan came out with bringing it all back home came out with a single cover version of mr. Tambourine Man and that song was a huge hit for the Byrds it wasn't even a single originally from Dylan's album but it was a huge single for the birds the birds actually named their debut LP after that single it's such a sugary pop rock version and they tried to do the same thing with the song the times they are a-changin on their next full-length album which you might remember also features the song didn't and so let's just say that the fusions of funk and rock music up until this point we're sort of more on the pop rock side at the time though let's not ignore the fact that rhythm in blues is kind of like an early version of folk rock anyway I mean we have the blues which is a style of American folk music that was then given electric guitars and you have rhythm in blues but rhythm and blues eventually gave way to rock and roll deeper into the 50s and then it sort of lost a little bit more touch with its blues roots in the 60s as we got pop rock and psychedelic rock and then at this time we have people sort of thinking like hey what's this folk stuff we forgot about it's so awesome and this is about the time that you had Dylan over here taking the new contemporary sounds of rock music and studio production and combining them with the old organic route seer sounds of this recently rediscovered American folk music on this LP Dylan didn't just want to take these folk songs and apply them to just popular flavor of the month pop rock instrumentation he wanted to bring in piano and organ in that rock ensemble while staying in touch with those folk and blues music roots as in touch with that as you could be for the mid 60s but referencing and pulling from these traditions is also the point of the title of this record Dylan sort of sees highway 61 on this album as kind of this I guess main vein through these cultural landmarks for him in America you know where you can kind of head from the the Midwest where he was raised to the south which was the birthplace of a lot of very important folk music and blues for Dylan and that sort of live in the moment roots II organic feel that you get out of folk music is very much on full display on this recording there is tons of just ambient sound surrounding the drums drums are loud but they don't really sound like they're miked all that close either the guitars are just noisy they are just strung out the harmonicas are very bright they're shrill the bass is just kind of clunky the acoustic guitars are just strummed very chaotically this is an incredibly raw and blemished recording for its time with the exception of the opening track which was actually produced by Tom Wilson who produced the last Bob Dylan album for the rest of this LP Dylan actually works with producer Bob Johnston who he pulls together just a much more coarse sound which actually continues a bit onto Dylan's next full-length LP blonde on blonde which is my favorite record in his discography you can actually hear a very clear difference between the way that like Rolling Stone and the rest of the tracks on this LP are performed recorded and assembled I mean by comparison like a rolling stone the drums are much quieter they're much more finely produced and just the whole thing instrumentally is much more cleanly assembled than the rest of the record here I know it probably all just sounds like 60 to us because we're so far away from this era but there's a very fine subtle stylistic details between Wilson and Johnston's production styles on this LP not that it really takes away from the album because like a rolling stone is fantastic song but then compare that to the very next song on this album tombstone blues we have the most cleanly assembled track right next to one of the most chaotic songs on the entire record tombstone blues in my opinion has one of the most wacked-out drum beats to ever be on a record from an artist this big for their time it's just this booming bass drum and this crashing cymbal and snare being hit at the same time driving very fast really propelling this song at a very quick speed this track feels like just a very very fast drive down a dusty highway the Sun is beating down on you sand in your face you're on the verge of a sunburn for me this song is as proto-punk if not more proto-punk than any kink single they came out with in the mid or late 60s and you know considering how much of a direct in influence this album had on guys like we read you know Velvet Underground there's really nothing more proto-punk than influencing the Velvet Underground is there no however even though the song is kind of punky kind of Rocky it still keeps in touch with those folk and blues traditions again which is the point of this record we have like a rolling stone which features electric guitar feature some sweet organs a nice drumbeat and iconic chorus as well as theme melody some very catchy catchy harmonica playing and some lyrics that are kind of abstract but when you read into them a little bit more deeply it's kind of like a fall from grace for someone who used to be I guess kind of in the lap of luxury I guess sort of privilege but then one day they kind of wake up and find themselves on the verge of homelessness or just kind of homeless someone who kind of has the world turned over on its head for them someone who now has to figure out how to live life from scratch and Dylan singing on this track is so passionate it's overwhelming as he's singing how does it feel he's calling out so I guess you could say aggressively with so much energy that it's almost as if he expects like an answer back then as I said we have the song tombstone blues which features these rambling scrawled lyrics they seem kind of chaotic and just manically delivered but they are very pointed and very smart lyrics just delivered over this very chaotic noisy full crack instrumentation and as the song goes along we get this imagery of American heroes like Paul Revere or guys like Jack the Ripper at the head of the Chamber of Commerce we're also getting insane depictions of religious figures as well as politicians and while all of this chaos is going on we have the refrain of the track talking about just average everyday people living through destitution no shoes no food while all of this chaos at the top of the power pyramid is going on everyone down at the bottom is suffering again even though Dylan isn't being like you know politicians politicians usings you me this that everything he's not making such bold playing statements but he's still saying something and in addition to tombstone blues we have other tracks on here that are similarly chaotic folk rock songs with these rambling lyrics the track from a Buick six or the title track off of this LP things settle down a little bit on the next song it takes a lot to laugh it takes a train to cry we get some nice blues piano on this song and it's it's just a beautiful little tune and a bit of a reminder of sort of that blues tradition not only because of the the flavor and the melodies on the piano of this track but also just transman trains I mean to blues music trains were such an integral thing not only in terms of spreading the music but I mean trains at that time when the Blues were kind of coming into formation was just a way of life a necessity for travel so you know it's just funny to think of how little trains there are in music now just so few trains and we also have some ballads in the track listing here to like Ballad of a Thin Man which is just so depressing not even from a lyrical standpoint just the sound of this instrumental from the kind of plinky saloon style piano just very sad chords and melodies and the organ embellishments on this track too and Dylan's singing is just so pained on this song or just kind of like kind of like he's a I don't know being this voice of reason who might have warned the the protagonists of this track at one time and now he's kind of there to be like I told you so I told you so and this song is a lot like the opening track on here where we kind of have a figure driving the song who sort of seems to be wealthy not in money but sort of in connections or knowledge and perception and understanding and now he is put into a position where the world just no longer makes sense and Bob Dylan paints this picture with a ton of just confusing surreal imagery later in the tracklisting hear the song just like Tom them blues lyrically is equally surreal but the instrumental backdrop of this track is just so much warmer so much less depressing and the very somber delicate and quiet closer on here an acoustic track Desolation Row is a very wonderful and warm finish to this record which is a pretty turbulent emotional experience from very fiery aggressive highs to just sad down in the dumps lows the track is 11 minutes long it really glides things out gently really kind of you know coasts you down from the insanity of the previous eight tracks and Dylan makes a series of just surreal and abstract lyrical points with pretty much every verse here the guitars on this tractor sound absolutely gorgeous and you know there's not really anything else I feel like I can say about these tracks or this album I guess I really haven't gone that much into Dylan's vocal style but it's it's just such an established sound that you know I don't really know if I need to go that deep into it hey that's really more of a parody personally Dylan's kind of throaty who focal x' have been a turn-off for some but maybe I've kind of found them to be more tuneful than others do and I just find his delivery even when he's kind of doing this talk singing thing to be incredibly captivating and expressive as well as I guess kind of riveting I mean everything he says and this is partially not just because of his his vocal delivery but the quality of his lyrics too but I just find myself hanging on every single word he says and that's pretty much why this album is fantastic if you give this LP you listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why transition a hey yo what up you're the best forever 
_55TxraLHuc,hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a classic review of the tangerine dream record phaedra tangerine dream was a German electronic music outfit founded in the 60s by mr. Edgar Froese II who passed away recently incredibly unfortunate but up until that point the band had remained pretty active with a steady stream of studio albums and live albums and soundtrack work they even did the cinematic soundtrack to the new Grand Theft Auto video game however in this review here we are going to be focusing on one of their more popular records an album that came out in the midst of a very fruitful point in the group's career in the 70s while they were signed to Virgin Records as discussed in my classic review of the Kraftwerk album trans europe express 1970s very different time for electronic music for the genre it was early but it was still very much alive and at this time the artists in Germany's blossoming electronic experimental psychedelic music scene were dropping their best stuff people I can no Kraftwerk Faust Harmonia cluster and all these groups had different styles different directions and tangerine dream was further down on the more electronic side of that spectrum though they were still influenced by things like progressive rock and psychedelic rock as well as classical music and minimalism and again it's the 70s a different time for electronic music before the explosion in relevancy of drum machines during the new wave synth pop zenith of the 80s though throughout their career tangerine dream incorporated a multitude of different instruments into their records guitars and basses drums woodwinds and acoustic instrumentation the band's approach to writing was mostly synthesizer or keyboard based Moog's and organs Mellotron Selectric pianos as well as sequencers and with this instrumentation the band will create these 1020 or almost 30-minute compositions that were epic and moody in morphus and it wasn't unusual for an artist like tangerine dream to put together two or four tracks of this size and just call it an album an artist in this branch of Germany's experimental pioneering music scene at the time artists that we're making these long textured atmospheric compositions music historians would label them as being part of the Berlin school keep in mind there isn't literally a school this label also includes artists like clouds Scholes who also played with tangerine dream early on in the band's career or Manuel got Ching who has solo work as well who also created music with Asha and a shras temple but if you wanted to cast a wider net for this genre of music you could simply call it progressive electronic and then it would include artists like Frances Jean Michel Jarre or Greece's Vangelis who I actually think showcase just a little bit more classical music influenced in his works music of this style at the time it had an audience it was popular in its own right but it saw even more exposure through soundtrack work for television and film people like Vangelis actually saw great success through this on soundtracks like chariot of fire or Blade Runner and these television and film soundtracks would have a huge influential impact on more modern artists like Boards of Canada or zombie so that's much of the context that surrounds this record but what does the music itself offer well this record is essentially four tracks not that long of an album definitely easier to get into than some of the more dense works earlier on in the band's discography like Zeit we have the almost 17 minute title track the mysterious semblance at the strand of nightmares not as long movements of visionary and then the sort of tidbit 2 minute closer sequent see which we can kind of get out of the way now it leaves the album off with a very ethereal Airy relaxed feel it's essentially a flute piece with a lot of echo or reverb or delay on the flute to the point where the very slow moving notes are kind of just folding over one another very pleasantly very beautifully the centerpiece of this record really is the title track here to kick things off you get these pulsating synth sequences growing in size behind a wall of ethereal synth chords eventually this gives way to some very stiff but elegant lead melodies that just shimmer I would describe them as silvery or shiny and there's something kind of futuristic about them too and the track essentially transitions from one tension building synth phrase to another until we get to a point where we're getting like these demon calls popping up in every direction as they swim through this sea of synthesizer swells but the synthesizer sequences or the arpeggios that are just bubbling and just keeping rhythm throughout the song suddenly start shifting in pitch around the second third of the track which I read in a few places might have just been a technical issue with the equipment they were using starting to get overheated from either's being on a long time or just heavy use so the band essentially uses this opportunity to just shift the song away from from this part to another movement entirely tangerine dream really coasts into a very desolate soundscape to end the song off and there are these really weird wailing tones hanging in the distance that sound like a I don't know like a baby polar bear calling out for its mother in the middle of a blizzard in a frozen tundra then these dreary chords are introduced and the song essentially sounds like it's sound tracking its own apocalypse really the next track mysterious semblance is much more simple in build the song essentially features these dreary Airy synth chords that really make up the bulk of the track these synth chords are treated to various effects or just some studio trickery that changes the size or the shape or the distance or just how thin were full the chords feel sometimes they're panned hard to the left or the right for a moment the synth chords are swallowed by windy effects I think the actual music that these chords are playing with the synths are playing is really beautiful and really touching it's really somber but the way tangerine dream treats this synth playing it's like you're listening to what's going on as well as trying to keep your eyes or just your conscious on where exactly the instrumentation is moving throughout the recording however the recording toward the end becomes much larger and much more vast and sounds like the lonesome terrain of a distant planet somewhere moments like this are really ambient very low-key not anywhere near as lively as some of the more rock influenced stuff tangerine dream would drop on albums like force majeure in the late 70s and the next track on here really pushes that soundscape vibe as well there are some bustling synthesizer sequences that are introduced eventually in the song really gains direction but even in these moments I don't really feel like I'm listening to a a song as much as I am a painting of a landscape or just something really cinematic and all in all that is the tangerine dream record phaedra interesting little progressive electronic album while in my opinion not one of the most epic in the genre and not one of the most epic and tangerine Dream's entire discography it's certainly one of the easiest to get into it's concise it's well put together I think it exemplifies a lot of the key characteristics of this genre and execute them really really well and I think it's an album you should check out transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana tangerine dream pedra forever 
X0UtPI9Jp2Y,on alright come on I'm tired I'm tired it should be the end of the year already I'm just ready to get list we've done so I can just you know relax a little bit so as you already know it's list week final list video favorite 50 albums of 2015 not really much else to say let's go hey hey hey hey hey hey Merry Christmas everybody ah why must you always stand in the way of progress Merry Christmas Anthony did you get me present this year honestly I did I did not get you anything this year oh well I mean there's one thing um there's someone who watches the show his name is Matt Rollins and he passed me a copy of one of my favorite David Byrne records him and Brian you know come together on my life in the bush of ghosts thank you very much for that I appreciate it and you wrote this lovely letter over here talking about how he loves the show and he also uh added a little present for you in here so uh whoa yeah oh my god oh my god it can't be it can't be bitch I guess my favorite soundtrack xtd Sherk well I'm glad you like it because it's it's all you're gonna get for this year let's get right into this list over here top 50 albums of the year whoo all right we are kicking off the list with a few records that did not make it onto my love list this year we're just short of making it onto it but grow on me a little bit and made it into my top 50 so kicking it off with a death metal record maybe the most gruesome and disgusting death metal record you will eight years on this year piss graves suicide euphoria at number 49 we have dope body with chunk then tame impala with currents following that up is the new Neon Indian album Vega international night school and then woods with his brief and conceptual today I wrote nothing okay I'm going to be speeding through this list until we get to the halfway point and then doing a little bit more description on some of the records in this list at 45 we have Colin Stetson and Sarah Neufeld with never were the way she was an interesting little collaborative experimental instrumental music album young fathers with white men are black men to cease with Z napalm death returns with a gritty grindcore installment apex predator easy meat and at 41 it is mr. Joey badass with his full-length commercial debut before the money at number 40 it is cattle decapitation with the Anthropocene extinction 39 the game with the documentary 2.5 at 38 it's ken mode with success 37 hop along with painted shut and at 36 the underachievers with their conceptual evermore art of duality double album at 35 we have unknown mortal Orchestra with multi love at 34 we have panopticon's with autumn eternal 33 Lianne La Havas with blood at 30 twos are faced with every hero needs a villain and at 31 Alabama Shakes with sound and gaya at 30 we have jeff rosen stock with the snarky and punky we cool then Sleaford mods with key markets very I guess sarcastic and funny and mean-spirited album this is though not mean to everyone and at 28 we have a little ugly Mane with the large and in charge album compilation third side of tape 27 Milo with so the Flies don't come 26 Sophie with product and at 25 one of the most mind-bending strange and interesting auditory experiences I had this year ash Cuccia with good okay getting deeper into the list joanna newsom returns with a new record on number 24 very conceptual very interesting lyrics on this thing as well as I guess some musical changes as well a little more piano on this thing than usual but still a beautiful and captivating album at 23 we have the even more conceptual mountain goats with beat the champ this is an album of interesting I guess indie folk indie rock tunes that are all about professional wrestling at number 22 it's Drake with his really great mixtape that I enjoyed a lot this year if you're reading this it's too late and at number 21 Chelsea wolf with her incredibly sludgy heavy metallic and brooding full-length album abyss at number 20 we have Travis Scott with his latest full-length LP which blew me out of the water surprised me did not anticipate enjoying this record as much as I did but I have been coming back to it again and again and again this year I just think it's well produced I think it's very colorful production I think it's just an artsy approach to that lowdown and dirty trap and Atlanta sound that we're hearing so prevalently in hip hop right now and then at 19 I have to give it to destroyer for poisons season Dan Behar and company are back with a very theatrical and poetic rock album this time around bit of a return to form but sounds like it would work so much better on a on a brightly lit stage and then 18 I have to give it to Algiers for their self-titled full-length LP lovin this dark kind of politically conscious post-punk sound that they're bringing on this thing thought it was fantastic at number 17 a sludge metal record that really was a go-to for me at the gym this year listen to this record repeatedly as I was pumping iron I'm talking about high on fire with luminiferous then at 16 it is father John misty with the very romantic I love you honey bear grace had songs on this LP really beautiful instrumentation funny snarky lyrics as well his amazing just hilarious lyrics coming through on a lot of these tracks and then I got to give it to something a little weirder something a little more on the fringe OneNote Rick's point never at fifteen with garden of delete and going further down that experimental abyss is Prien at number fourteen with frozen Niagara Falls and more tortured at number 13 is the new Leviathan album scar sighted a hellish traumatizing black metal record that you should hear if you haven't already then at twelve one of my favorite mixtapes of the year its injury reserve with live at the dentist's office and 11 another record I found myself returning to a lot this year and I ended up enjoying it more than I thought I was going to even though I liked it in the review it definitely grew on me a little bit I will say I loved aughts latest full-length LP Sun coming down and here we are ladies and gentlemen added a chopped in kicking off the top 10 is a metal record a lean well put together metal album with great songwriting great guitar playing overall some pretty good production as well and it came out very late in the year it was kind of like the just through three-pointer it was like bam bam as the clock was running out whoa whoa it's a great record I'm talking about Baroness with purple very impressed with this album been listening to her been returning to it repeatedly since it released just a few weeks ago really impressed with this record I think the band kicked ass this time around kicked ass and then I have to give it to another record that grew on me this year the new everything-everything album get to heaven this record I didn't play in this thing a lot man for me this is like the future of pop music although pop music and rock music will probably not sound like this five or 10 years from now it'll probably be I don't know it'll probably sound like the new Miley Cyrus album or something like that but if we were to live in an ideal future I think more groups would be embracing the very progressive and very colorful sonic and instrumental aspects of this record at number eight a really off-the-wall obnoxious and very strange rock album it is a comeback album it's a record that I thought would be a little higher on my list but there were a few albums here that really passed it out in terms of favorability but I do have to give it to the pop group for their latest full-length LP citizens of Manor yeah but inching past this LP is the new Bjork album vuln Akira Bjork really came through on this LP returned to a slightly older sound of hers Vespertine the kind of baroque and art pop elements of that album show up here as well and as some of you may already know that is my favorite Bjork album so it's kind of cool to see her embracing that sound once again but also sad because this is a breakup album and a really intense one at that if you pay some pretty direct attention to the lyrics on this thing and inching past this LP at number six is the new Clarence clarity album no now this is one of the weirdest records of her this year but it's also one of the catchiest records I've heard this year at the same time this thing is an experimental pop onion that I just peel more and more layers past every single time I listen to it every time I hear this thing I mean not only do I enjoy the the the very catchy and very sweet songs at the core of a lot of these tracks more and more but I'm just hearing new things and just learning new things about this album even in the conversation I had with this guy during an interview I feel like he did I feel like the album is still very mystical to me it's it's like you can't pull the veil back on this thing because there's a veil behind a veil behind a veil behind a veil but in a really cool way not necessarily in a frustrating way or anything like that so going further up the list number five top five right now Julia halter have you in my wilderness wonderful beautiful heavenly baroque and dream pop on this thing stunningly gorgeous effervescent I can't really say enough nice things about this record it's easily the prettiest album I've heard in 2015 and that's why it's so high up on this list it's a parrot at number four I'm going to give it to the occults to the extravagant to the inspiring new ghost album meliora hell of a metal record this year I think ghost really came through they gave me the album that I wanted their second album to be this time around this thing I just really don't have that many complaints about the song writing a salad the production is fantastic the performances are great the guitar tones are good and it just really kind of gave me this sense that I was in a totally different world I was in ghosts world this time around it wasn't just simply like I was listening to a band with their first record or with their second record I was in the middle of this dark satanic mass ritual and I'm loving it at number 3 we have to give it to the three our the three part the triple album the jazz record of the year the new Kumasi washington album and and the next step the epic all I have to say about this record is what I first had to say when I listen to this album all the way through and that is yes yes yes and number two in the list I got to give it to my dudes Death Grips for completing the powers-that-be double album with the second half Jenny death which a lot of people were highly anticipating it actually lived up to the hype hilariously enough one of the most aggressive releases in their discography right there and pairing it with the first half of the record they're just a great combination and just like so many tracks of experimental loud aggressive mind-bending hip-hop and rock and electronic music I mean Death Grips they just continue to blur so many borders with their music while also referencing the the roots and the basics of hip hop of punk rock so yeah that's number two and I think you guys can already guess what was number one I gave this album an incredibly positive review incredibly high score and it's my most watched review of this year and I think a lot of you guys appreciate this album the same way that I do you know I love the concept of this record I love the story of this record the music and the production on this record are amazing Kendrick Lamar to pimp a butterfly Kendrick really outdid himself on this album I think this record in a lot of ways mirrors good kid maad city and that it is a personal story of growth and making the right choices but it just kind of occurs during another chapter of Kendricks life were no longer that young Kendrick sort of growing up in Compton where now this older Kendrick sort of navigating his way morally through this music industry of excess and people looking to kind of take advantage of you in every direction and also kind of this struggle of trying to be this star but also trying to be a dependable reliable functioning emotionally healthy person and these personal struggles are also used to play out and shed some light on some larger social issues as well which is also part of what makes this record so powerful it's just a really great record and at this point I can't really say anything that I haven't already said in my review which I will link down there in the description along with reviews to every other one of these albums and I can't thank you guys enough for watching these reviews hanging with me for this past year what about my mixtape my next date um okay uh here-here's here's a list uh the top one count your chest and mega take mixtapes out of the year oh boy who's gonna get it who's gonna get the number one okay at number one we have Cal chesta with the new Cal lassic number one on the list the best Cal chest a mixtape that came out this year I can't believe it I can't believe it this is a diner this is such another I want to take my man I want to take my dead I want to take bed can take record roll who is ition I'm done I'm done twenty last video of 2015 oh I'm gonna go wrap some Christmas presents take nap ah forever 
XbJIFmZLiHM,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and you know what time it is we're still in the midst of 2015 last boy where I'm listening out my musical highlights of the year already talked about honorable mentions worst albums of the year favourite EPS of the year and now singles and promotional tracks trash that T's toward the release of particular records or songs that are released on 7 inches or just as single tracks available for commercial purchase or download these 50 songs are in my opinion the biggest on the Bethan gold other year I'm going to be going like I said through 50 tracks we're going to speed through the first 25 and then go through a little more detail and description as we reach the top 10 so starting at 50 we have deer hunter with snake skin then comes in Action Bronson with act and crazy Toro y Moi with empty-nesters then The Chemical Brothers with go featuring q-tip Florence and machine with ship to wreck kalila with rewind and then liturgy coming in with cracks a choral young thug with best friend yes I just enjoyed this track and then leaf with rage and then closing in 41 is David Hasselhoff with true survivor if you have not heard this song please listen to it at number 40 we have Pusha T with untouchable 39 Chelsea Wolfe with carrion flowers at 38 it's Mac Miller with 100 grandkids at 37 dope body with obey and then at 36 it is unknown mortal Orchestra with multi love at 35 it's the game with 100 featuring Drake 34 we have Alabama Shakes with no mouth no mouth 33 chance the rapper with angels 32 Weezer with do you want to get high Sufjan Stevens with should have known better in at number 30 a nightmare of a track from David Bowie I'm a black star black star 29 Neon Indian going in this landlord I guess on the song slumlord at number 28 Tame Impala with let it happen 27 fka twigs within time at number 26 we have Sophie with by Z and then at 25 we have our dude igloo ghost with a single that followed the release of his latest EP the jinjo single okay get up in the list now so we have 24 Animal Collective with the fantastic floridaa single which is a wonderful return to form for the band and has me pretty excited for their next full-length album it's a really cool neo psychedelic pop track with a great hook a lot of personality and some dense colorful production at number 23 Travis Scott don't you love another window editor a ridiculously infectious ear worm of a single hard-hitting beat just and I just can't really complain too much about this track some of the lyrics are kind of silly but I just can't say no to the song it's just such an intoxicating feel-good single or maybe just like a feel high out of your mind single and number 22 we have the punky and attitude loaded sleater-kinney with the title track to their latest record mr. Doug and then 21 Grimes comes through with the reality single definitely one of my favourite singles of the year and the revision of this track off her latest record wasn't that bad either at number 20 it is the pop group with the lead single off of their return album citizen zombie the track mad truth a really great danceable post-punk track it's really wild kind of freakish and at number 19 though I didn't really love this LP I think the single is great and I love the hook off this thing I think it's got a lot of personality coming through on the lyrics I just wish some of the singing on the deeper cuts of this record was better I'm talking about Shamir's call it off it's definitely an addictive track for me and then following that we have Julia halter with the track C calls me home definitely one of the more extravagant and refined tracks of her latest full-length album have you in my wilderness if you're looking for some very instrumentally extravagant dream pop and art pop and baroque pop then look into this at Number 17 we have carly rae jepsen with this a bit of a throwback there with a lot of tracks off her latest LP felt like a really sharp modern take on some really great 80's pop and then at 16 we have mi a with the refugee tribute song borders which was a really hard hitting i opening music video but track as well at number 15 got to give it to my dude clarence clarity with the really emotional but also disturbing and strange blood barf bit of a weird dense and experimental take on pops specifically like dance pop and boyband pop from the 2000s on this record over here and then following that we have the weekend with the track can't feel my face another record that notoriously i did not enjoy the album overall was kind of indifferent toward it but I liked the change of mood like the change of pace and I liked the tune that this track brought I just wish each song off the new LP was as hard-hitting and as instantaneous and as groovy too because I loved the beat on this thing at number 13 a track that when I first heard it I did not care for it at all because I thought it was just obnoxious but with more listens I actually kind of got the humor behind it I thought the tune was actually really well written and I liked the lyrics as well the chorus is sharp Jeff Rosenstock with the song nausea and then we have donnie trumpet in the social experiment with Sunday candy another track off of an LP that I did not dig the full-length album at all but this was a great teaser track toward the record got me released psyched for it and it's still a beautiful tune with a great mix of elements from hip hop jazz and gospel music that blend together really well at number 11 we have Algiers with iron utility protects your yo-yo which is Algiers taking their particular brand of post-punk and bringing it all the way back to the 80s where they're kind of reliving like a bit of synth pop drum machine pop and goth rock all at the same time it's a pretty fantastic and now we are in the top two whoo okay number 10 it's my dudes from Arizona an injury reserve with he sheds he said everybody knows bah blah blah blah everybody knows great hard-hitting rap track here with a bombastic chorus really raspy vocals on this thing clever sharp just really a funny verses and a great instrumental as well this is easily when my favorite rap tracks of the year no question and then at number nine I could not deny it a lot of you may be surprised to see this song so far up on this list but I think it's a great single from the go I was pretty impressed with its sleepy easygoing melody really intoxicating beat and yeah just a lead vocals as well Drake with hotline bling just loving it when you need a hat a minute I looked this on my list number eight my boys in the progressive rock and pop outfit everything everything a track off of the latest full-length LP get to heaven the song did you do the distant past I wanna go back such a killer song so many blends of rock and pop music in this one really well-crafted song amazing poly rhythms on this track it's really great layers of guitar since vocals the vocals are a little weird but still one of my favorite singles of the year love this track another track that was glued a little harder to my mind though was the new and the Taemin single for the song hi I feel weird admitting how much I love this song but I do I think it's a I think it's a fantastic tract I wish this song had been released in the 2000s when uh this type of music would have been much more prevalent in the mainstream and then it would have just been interesting and funny to sort of see how far it could have gone on the charts if it even had a chance at doing that but yeah it's just a really sharp well-written pop tune with some quirky production the high somewhat chipmunk vocals that you expect from a PC music oriented track but it's it's simultaneously incredibly accessible and lyrically the track dives into the the isolation and the loneliness of love on the internet which I don't think a lot of love songs are willing to address it seems like in today's dating sphere in today's dating landscape that's literally a huge elephant in the room that a lot of modern love songs don't address at all but this song faces it head-on number six is a comeback single from Missy Elliott WTF were they from she's back she's back and with a fantastic new song featuring Pharrell great beat funny lyrics great dance song humongous groove on this thing the vs. aren't too bad either it's an addictive fun colorful track I just I love it I love it man and I think it's one of the brightest most shining moments for mainstream pop and rap music this year at number five a really great promotional metal track that dropped this year from an album that just came out I'm talking about the new Baroness single shot really grand epic hard-hitting track Baroness really came through with a killer record this time around and I cannot wait to throw it on to my favorite albums of the year list but another record that is going to be on my albums of the Year lists obviously very high up in the rankings is ghosts and their single first thirst I landed on this project ghosts just put together a hell of a merit metal the ghost just put together a hell of a metal record this year and this track contributed to that not really sure what I can say up until this point that I haven't already said in my review of their latest full-length LP give a listen to this song give a listen to ghosts latest album meliora you will not regret it if you're into very melodic kind of occult and very theatrical campy metal music at number three another single I have played multiple times I love it for its mash of music both old and new it's great dance beat it's glossy synthesizers it's really fantastic feature from young thug and just top-notch production I'm talking about Jamie xx with pop can of course and young thug on the song good times good times to go to be goo times good times whoo at number two number two favorite single of the year I have to give it to death grips with the melodic heart-wrenching and depressing on GP not only was this song a different sound a new sound for Death Grips but I think a new emotional palette for death grips as well coming together with a song that I feel like put a genuine sadness to a lot of the aggression and madness that typically turns up in a death grip song in Stefan's or Rides lyrics it's a really dynamic track the guitar plays into what the band is doing especially that lead melody band man really well and yeah it was just a really cool topical and musical transition for the band that went over way better than I think it should have so kudos to Death Grips on that and I hope they continue experimenting and pushing into the future with just really exciting new musical ideas but song of the year has to go to mr. Kendrick Lamar for the black of the berry love this track killer fucking track a song that is probably the most political off of his latest full-length LP to pimp a butterfly and I think sort of puts on display the who wants the duality of a lot of the racial tensions that America has been suffering through this year it's rare to come across commentary in this day and age that that is actually as balanced and as sharp as what Kendricks verses do in this tract but on top of that it's just a great fucking song the boom bap style beat Kendricks flow on this thing also the killer vocal appearance from assassin on this track the deep dark beefy vocals he brings to the track as well as the very hellish keyboards on this song just so much musicality on this track I don't know I could just praise it forever and and in a way I already have with my 22 minute review of a butterfly and yeah I mean I have linked this review and I have linked this song down below along with many of the other songs on this list so you could check them out for yourself and see if you dig them so let me know what some of your favorite songs singles were of this year give me your top 5 top 10 whatever you want to throw down there in the comments maybe tell me why certain songs appeal to you more than other songs if you feel like it and yeah feel free to check out anything on this list that you haven't already because I assure you a lot of it is worth your time you're the best transition have you given this album a listen and if you have session and there you go my favorite singles my favorite promotional tracks of the year what were some of your favourite singles of the year let me know your the best what I'll see you gotta say to me smash that right 2016's on the way 2015 it's done it's over throw it in the trash flush it down the toilet let's go forever 
XWY-q1UYCRI,whoa whoa whoa hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here intranets busiest music nerd and as you may already know it's last week where I list out my favorite releases of the year musical highlights of 2015 and in this video I'm getting into my 15 favorite EPS of the year listed all the way up to my favorite EP of the year at number one so we have 15 here like I said we're gonna speed through the first five and get into a little more detail with the top ten don't forget about my mixtape your mixtape was a mixtape it's not even an EP would not even qualify for this list hey good SAG's and just mixtape whoa okay um I will try not to forget it as I put together the rest of these lists over here oh remember at number 15 we have the new parquet courts EP monastic living some interesting instrumental and minimalist experimental rock on this thing then at 14 the new Thundercat EP the beyond and where Giants roam if you're looking for a bit of neo soul and new jazz look into this thing then the various artists on the catcher of the fade EP seems like it was a bit of a I don't know a swan song a very quiet swan song for the Hellfire Club people as artists like opened my eagle and Milo come together on the handful of tracks that made it onto this free downloadable EP we have Nicholas jar with his nymphs EPS at number 12 and at number 11 effects twin under another pen name a FX recently dropped an EP this year what sounds like older material was stuff that was way more engaging than the bulk of what landed on cyro and in my opinion okay moving on from there at number 10 we have Swain aka the boys formerly known as this routine is hell coming together with the heavy dancing EP which is an interesting turn an interesting musical switch for them where they're essentially making very heavy sludgy hardcore punk with a little bit of grunge influence as well sounding kind of 90s but you this thing was in my opinion a little I guess underwhelming not enough material would really be just head over heels for this thing it's gonna be interesting to see if this band executes with this sound on their next full-length LP at number nine a death metal EP varam current mouth this thing is incredibly savage gross disgusting mean guttural and just all around nasty and I have to say I was impressed with this thing sort of caught on to it very recently not early enough to sort of do a review on it before it made it onto this list however that sort of practice is nothing new for my yearly EPS list I try to trip back and find EPS that might have fallen under my radar and if you're into death metal if you're in the extreme metal then I recommend you check this thing out because it was pretty well performed some interesting riffs and melodies on this thing as well as the usual nastiness and extremity that I expect and enjoy in a death metal record at number 8 some post-punk and some noise rock mayhem from the band gorilla toss on their latest EP the guitars the drums on this thing are fun chaotic sometimes they're herky-jerky and danceable and the shrinkie lead vocals on the singer very ear grabbing fun and colorful very interested to see if this band continues down this path on their next full-length LP then at number 7 another EP I did not review this year but revisiting it because I know it was a pretty hyped EP revisiting it for this list I enjoyed it quite a bit is the new Earl Sweatshirt EP solace it was very dark very dreary very downtrodden very depressing much like a lot of the material on I don't like shad I don't go outside but some of it felt like I don't know a little more fleshed out and also like it hit closer to home and had a bit of a level of relatability to it especially that moment about his grandmother on this thing which in a way sort of tore me apart emotionally and it was just a really strong captivating moment Mad Men Whitman our next EP also deals with some pretty extreme angry in-your-face emotions the gloss demo EP this hardcore punk band absolutely just stopped my face in with this new EP over here it's sludgy it's slow it's heavy the lyrics deal in a lot of trans issues issues of hate discrimination sexuality and I think it just brazenly puts them against some pretty badass guitar riffs also at number five I will shout out the new Mac DeMarco EP / mini album wasn't really sure how to categorize this thing some people are calling it an album some people are calling it an EP for the sake of this list I'm gonna call it an EP and even though you may think it's an album I'm just gonna call it that to get it on this list because I didn't like it I wasn't head over heels for it but I did like it more than his latest album certainly very dreamy sweet little love songs but also incredibly sad songs on this thing as well Mac DeMarco going into I guess more somber territory with this project really pulling at a lot of heartstrings it was a little easygoing a little breezy a little slow didn't quite have the pop appeal of some of the tracks off of - but I liked it I liked it I loved this next EP however I did review it thought it was a clever little rap EP it's the new your old Droog EP the Kinison EP it is a hip hop EP with really fantastic verses that overtly reference rock music and numerous rock bands an interesting concept and your old Droog is I guess exactly the artist to carry that concept out because he does an amazing job with one track after another the seat it was a cool little concept I still commend I still think it's a great P and I'm looking forward to seeing if he is as ambitious on his next album let's go forward to number three open mike eagle a special episode of a bit of an afterthought to his dark comedy record but that was a really great record and I feel like nearly every track here could go toe to toe with much of the material on that album especially his revision of the opening track on that album with the dark comedy Late Show which is easily the best track here and I think one of Mike's best tracks period I think he's continuing to show improvement with each new release and I'm just wondering how far can he take it this EP excites me it's a good handful of songs from an incredibly talented clever and thoughtful rapper at number two we have an EP that is incredibly forward-thinking when it comes to electronic music coming from the brain feeder camp and just all around a very fun release with a lot of density a lot of character a lot of intricacies interviewed this guy as well had a lot of very cool things to say about his music I'm talking about igloo ghosts with the Chinese New Year EP if you want to hear elements of Flying Lotus maybe a little bit of PC music some house some hip-hop some trap just he throws everything together into a blender it's such a clutter but it's a beautiful clutter and incredibly just overwhelming - so excitingly overwhelming that I can't wait for this dude to come out with a record if he packs an EP with so much mind-bending electronic music I can just imagine what he would do when allowing himself 40 minutes 50 minutes to make an impression and we will end off at number one my number one favorite EP of the year easily the most conceptual and fully realized EP I've heard this year even though it's not really that long it runs and it feels a lot like an album and in that I thought it was incredibly satisfying and I think it was kind of a step up in terms of the mind-bending weirdness that is fka twigs her debut full-length LP LP one which I enjoyed last year was great I liked that she made music that was so accessible did have so many obvious reference points to mainstream pop music to R&B but it sounds like in this new EP over here she just went completely off the deep end I mean a lot of those references are still there but this is so much more of a challenging stimulating listen for me so there you go those are my top 15 favorite EPS of 20 tene let me know what some of yours are if I have not listed them in this list you're the best transition what were some of your favorite EPS of this year I think I already asked you that mom hey I hope you guys have a good holiday hope you're doing well make sure to get some water stay hydrated eat those fruits and veggies get those vitamins and minerals and that's it you're the best Anthony Fantana he pees forever 
TVplf7tG09M,Pusha T said I was a real king of the youtubes a real king of the fucking YouTube that that was a good line off his new album project shout out to push it T hey everyone Anthony fan tanto here intranets busiest music nerd and as you may already know it's this week 2015 and I'm listing out basically the musical highlights for me of the year favourite EPS singles albums however we're going to kick things off with list week on a bit of a negative note before I get into the records that I really loved this year we're going to sort of flush the bad juju out of our system me like this like with the poopy no I I don't quite mean like that but sort of similar this is a list of the top 10 worst records I had reviewed this year they're not the 10 worst albums of the year point-blank period because there are plenty of awful albums that I completely glossed over because they were so bad I didn't want to review them there was really no point and I'm sure there are tons of other awful records that I just didn't hear this year because I don't actively go out seeking terrible music when you're reviewing a few hundred albums a year just some of it shows up on your doorstep it sort of comes with the territory you can't stop it and it seems like this year for whatever reason there were quite a few albums I responded to very negatively and I thought that they were worth noting in a video like this because the the scars that they've given me the mental scars I will most likely be carrying for at least the next few years so let's get into it at number 10 we have the Machine Gun Kelly album general admission now being a white person I don't have anything against white rappers just on the principle of being white and participating in hip hop a predominantly and historically black art form but this album sort of seems to feed into every single cliche you would expect there to be on a white rat for record and it does it in such an unattainable punch this album has coming he's like so much less emotionally engaging and lyrically intelligent version of Eminem with way more emotional baggage than he should have so yeah even though this thing at one point was the number one record in the country and lots of his fans we're happy to remind me of that and that's fine you know totally cool that the dude is still seeing success this deep into his career it's it's good that somebody is succeeding in the music world but me personally did not dig this project at all following that I I did a collaborative review for for this record with my buddy Mike c-town and it was it was really hard to sit through this album and and I got really excited to listen to this thing given some of the teaser tracks and the fact that the the production was so heavy and there were some connections to one of my favorite metalcore bands nails with this group but the twitching tongues record disharmony as Mike c-town will tell you as well if you go and ask him the music on its thing is like this some of the most diamon dozen hardcore and metalcore that you will have heard release this year but it's really the vocals that are the cherry on top of this cupcake of sadness I can kind of see what they're doing and I can appreciate that they're so strange but simultaneously they make the album really hard to listen to and they're funny just thinking back to the way that they sound but you know you might dig this album more than me and if you do that's totally fine but uh the this thing makes me giggle and and the the band actually caught the review that we did of this record and and they they thought it was funny too and they seem like they were good sports so you know shout out to the band too I don't care for the record but I gave it a not a shot and the you know I wish you guys more records in the future if you're if you're making headway with this stuff do your doing man following that we have the new foxing album dealer this record was just so hard to sit through even harder to sit through some of the records in this list that were so garish because the singing or maybe a certain element of what is in the music is awful because at least then it's so bad that it becomes at least intriguing in a way whereas this record is just a bland mush of every single alternative indie and post rock cliche you can name just thrown into a list assembled into a bunch of bland forgettable songs now that I think about it I can't remember not a single musical moment from this LP despite having listened to her numerous times in preparation for the review I did of this album but that's exactly what was wrong with this LP it was just so bland plain and forgettable and had absolutely no distinct characteristics to it whatsoever following that we have the new Willow Smith album which is easily one of the most airheaded and effortless art pop albums I've heard in a long time this thing sounds like it was merely just pulled together to further enhance willows internet presence like oh she's doing she's doing albums now - and they're like left-field indie artsy albums I can't even say I see a shred of artistic merit in this record because it feels like track 4 track 4 track that nobody on this thing really tried you know either that or this is their version of trying which seems to be nowhere near what your average career artist tries to do when coming together with a full-length album but the next person in this list oh he tried and he tries very hard which is part of what makes his music so hard to listen to the preaching Asst the cringy lines the ridiculous lot of it talking about Hopsin pound syndrome that line about the man who invented college never going to college unfortunately that is going to haunt Hopson for the rest of his career and and what is funny about this LP that was that inadvertently he did come together with one of the better songs of his career where he's essentially just making fun of future and you thug I believe on the song no words but on this record Hobson continues on this trend of of telling other people what they should think and trying to educate in school people while simultaneously making a few jokes here and there that are kind of funny like alright you made fun of somebody and it was kind of cool but that's not even a sliver of what the bulk of this album does which is just put on this air of pretentiousness as Hopson analyzes the world from the viewpoint of like a 15 year old atheist but whatever even this album had its merits its technical merits in comparison to this one the new goldlink album and after that we didn't talk goldlink for a little while seemed to be this really big hyped DC artist that had a really strong underground buzz and that buzz didn't shy away once the release of this album came out this was his biggest commercial project to date so I was pretty excited to try it out given that his fans loved it so much and I was just shocked to hear someone that sounded like a mere chance the rapper copycat but with nowhere near as much talent and somebody who sort of seemed to have a good grasp what made for great rap verses and some good bars as well but he rarely takes advantage of that talent in favor of just trying to sing for almost every track on this thing and his singing vocals are god-awful there's no reason for him to sing this often on this project especially given that he had access to guest singers which he could have had on here to sing for him instead but no he insisted on singing on pretty much every song from this project which made it just so unbearable not only that but the the concept that I think this album was trying to string together was super weak a lot of the lyrics warranted a lot of eye rolls this project had a lot of heart but it didn't have a lot of focus or even that much in the way of ideas to actually carry an albums length worth of material from beginning to end and have it be interesting engaging and so on and so forth but this album was no near is taxing as the next record on this list though this album did have its highlights I will say this album did have its highlights it did have a handful of good tracks on it but this thing was well over an hour and a lot of that hour was some of the most obnoxious music I heard this year I'm talking about little Dickies professional rapper from the get-go I found little Dickie really annoying with all these just very hokey comedy tracks that were about pre-gaming and getting laid and so on and so forth I could have taken him as just simply a comedy rapper you know just kind of like a bit of a Lonely Island offshoot or something like that I could have had mired him from that standpoint if he just kind of took that role accepted it and acceded at it I may not have bought any of his records I mean I'm not even really that much of a Lonely Island fan and what little dickie in terms of comedy raps seems to be doing is definitely less than but then this new record over here introduced this really ugly duality where little Dickie on releasing all these ridiculous silly just harebrained comedy but also conceptual tracks but simultaneously he drops all these songs and all these bars that remind you that he also wants to be taken seriously as a rapper he wants to change the game he wants to actually impress you and have you think he's like this really cool awesome talented guy who you would put into your top ten and not just this ha ha funny ha ha rapper when in fact that's all he is and unless he just gives up that side of his persona I don't see him accelerating or exceeding at anything else and just all the weird features on this thing and they're not funny jokes and the the songs that just go on way too freaking long I'm getting a headache just thinking about this album but the deeper I get into this list I'm just getting more and more headaches because the the list just grows more and more challenging and the next album I have on this list is the new dance Gavin dance album instant gratification which is anything but this is one of the noisiest and most unfulfilled and most ear grating post-hardcore records I've heard in a long time complete with like a really bad Lincoln Park quality rap verse toward the second half of the album that just had me salba Miz certainly technical in a sense and while I don't enjoy a lot of technical rock music I can at least respect that I guess the fans really enjoy the technical proficiency of those artists you know like Animals As Leaders and stuff like that and that's why they go to that music I don't really like it sounds a little mechanical little robotic to me but still I guess that requires someone to have a certain musical taste or whatever but I can't even see the merit behind the technicality on this thing because it's not like the playing is that flashy or it's that dense or it's that intricate it's just unbearably chaotic and on top of that it's topped with the kind of vocal work I would expect out of like a cut-rate emo or screamo band but as we go further down this list these albums do get harder to listen to and it's certainly harder to give a listen to all 90 minutes of Miley Cyrus's latest record Miley Cyrus and her dead pets which is a collaboration with The Flaming Lips all that ended up happening was a bunch of very cut-rate very horrible very bad very unbearable dream pop music with almost no direction or musical foresight involved in the creation of this project it all seems very off-the-cuff and in the most amateurish way possible it just kind of made Miley Cyrus seem really ridiculous I mean while I know she can be a talented singer if she really applies herself it seems like she really just kind of wanted to let go of anything and everything just for the sake of proving that her weirdness her oddity can also work itself into her music as well but the thing is I don't feel like the Miley Cyrus equation can work if you take out the pristine pop production that has supplemented her previous efforts if the music stops being radio friendly then what is my Syrus really just a walking freak show with the dildo strapped onto every part of her body but before I let go of the cell P there are a few other things worth worth mentioning uh what does it man what does it mean what a puppet that get a paw saying what I put the negative person who I put the Gus hey why Percy fun it fun and games are over everyone because this next album the number one worst album in my opinion that I've reviewed this year is a record that I've given my lowest scores thus far in in my youtube history and this has just been the year of the 90 minute album the bad 90 minute album the the hard to listen to the unbearable the who the hell made this why does this exist 90 minute album I admire the musical age that we're in very much because it allows for just wild experimentation and it allows for artists to go into whatever direction that they want to really surprise their fans if they want to if they want to do that and while I think that has resulted in some amazing albums the album's that I did not expect to like as much as I enjoyed it has also resulted in some records that have been a very tough listen because hey you know artists are free to experiment on something great and experiment on something terrible Kid Cudi speeding bullet to heaven that this was the hardest thing to listen to I had to review this year not only is it Kid Cudi trying to make a rock album which in the past he's already proven that he can't do that so I guess he figured he'd take another whack at it and and and he did it it's such a white horse or was even more of a grand failure than the last attempt he made and making a rock album which is kind of weird considering that I think he got closer to making a rock album this time than he did last time an authentic rock album you know we're hearing just real grimy organic kind of analog guitars on this thing we're hearing real drum sets a lot of the time too but the no I don't wanna be random or singing that kid cudi does just does not fit over this musical style and not only that but the sin of the songwriting oh it's just so vapid it's just such trash it's just so effortless it's like he's not even trying at this point and almost every single song just shows off these ugly horrid just completely detestable emotions like he's so far above the heads of everybody else that just to even simply hear criticism of his music he has to completely reject everyone and everything and just travel further down into this musical hermit like cave dwelling that he's made for himself and I don't know I'm really I'm really freaked out and scared for what he's going to do next because it seems like with each album that he gets a negative backlash from he just goes further and further into the abyss and just makes just uglier uglier and just more detestable music and it all seems to be fueled by this desire to like what what at this point you know the thing is you've come together with so many lack luster projects as a result of this reaction to negative backlash to your art that it seems like all you're proving at this point is how well you can destroy your music career you know I mean it was cute the first few times when it seemed like okay you know I don't like it but maybe he's gonna prove me wrong maybe he's gonna show me that he was going in the right direction all this time and that he's gonna blow my mind he's gonna blow everybody else's mind and there's going to be this aha moment where it's like you know I was doing great art I was making amazing music this whole time you guys are just too stupid to realize it but this album it not only is it terrible but it just kind of feels like we've hit a wall here yeah okay while I don't think Kid Cudi's next album is going to be great it can't be worse than this it can yeah it can't be worse than this it just can't so even to the kid cudi fans who were disappointed to this thing good news everyone like the next album has to be better it has to be better I did it I found the silver lining in this cloud over here it has to be better the next Kid Cudi record has to be better transition what albums in your opinion were the worst of 2015 albums that you thought might have dug little deeper into the pits of musical horror than the albums I have portrayed in the video you just watched I hope you're doing well list week continues EPS albums singles you're the best forever 
Mcv35GDsfuE,"Wow hey everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's the end of the year guys it's the end of the year so because it's the end of the year that means it's the start of list week where I'm going to be listing out my favorite albums singles and EPS of the year and a unique addition to this list week is I'm going to be talking about as well my top 10 least favorite albums of the year since I did review quite a few albums that I felt very strongly about but in the negative direction yeah I'm not gonna be doing a music videos video this year mostly because I wasn't really paying close attention to many music videos this year I was mostly into just the music which is great and fine and and I think the way it should be there weren't really any music videos that were stunning me this year some were pretty ridiculous and very mean worthy but there weren't a lot of music videos that were just like blowing my mind or anything like that so I'm just I'm just sticking to the music today for good and for bad but in this video I'm going to be listening out here are a handful of records that are not going to be making it on to my top 50 albums of the year list but they are getting honorable mentions and I recommend checking them out if you have the time and the curiosity and I will also in this video be talking about a group of different things that happen to me and this channel over the year that I think are worth mentioning and sort of noting to just kind of just throw all that stuff out there just to vent on it a little bit and then just just try to start next to your fresh so let's just kind of run through this list I have put all the reviews to these albums down there in the description box we have the new Christian Scott record stretch music if you're looking for a modern contemporary jazz record with a lot of variety a lot of flavor check this thing out the new Freddie Gibbs project shadow of a doubt Freddy's moodiest and just most melodic and an interior but also grimy and nocturnal project yet the new Adele record I thought was pretty good maybe not as amazing a 21 to certainly a decent follow-up I was way more impressed with the new Grimes album art angels than I thought I was going to be I think Grimes is really coming into her own as a pop song writer and a producer we also have the new Jamie xx album in color a record that I didn't love from front to back that certainly has some of my favourite singles of the year on and if you're really into dancey pop centric electronic music with a bit of an alternative edge to it then look into this thing shout out to the new Chemical Brothers album The Chemical Brothers made a pretty great comeback this year didn't blow my mind but certainly a nice comeback also the new Meek Mill project I thought he did a good job of putting this this album together and it seemed like he was really building up some momentum for himself in the mainstream and then he just completely demolished all of his efforts by getting into this quagmire of a beef with Drake where he only made himself look ridiculous sadly but still I think his efforts on this record should be commended the new tribulation album if you're looking for some kind of can't be theatrical metal music that's very song centric very melodic look into this album the title of this is the children of the night then there is the new liturgy album the ark work a record that I think had so much more potential if only it had been mixed and just mastered better especially with all the MIDI instrumentation the bells specifically that were really ear piercing kind of drowning out a lot of the guitars it seemed like if they had just had the great production that they did on their last record and then applied it to the really ambitious songs on this new record over here we would have had another fantastic LP in the Liturgy discography but still despite its production issues I think compositionally I think instrumentally I think conceptually there's a ton of interesting stuff going on with this album just don't be surprised if some of it sounds incredibly shrill and painful to your ears then there is the New Adventures album supersonic home if you're looking for a very poppy direct straightforward sweet little indie rock record then look into this thing shoutout to John Carpenter who had a really great comeback this year with a series of songs that I guess we're kind of lost themes which is the the title of the project Lupe Fiasco had a nice comeback this year sleater-kinney have a nice comeback this year Viet Cong rose from the ashes of women and came through with a good record and I also want to shout out Nicolas jar for the little left field completely unexpected soundtrack pomegranates they put together for the avant-garde Russian film of the similar title again links to reviews for those records links to songs from those records down in the description box and now personal strides I've made and milestones this channel has made in the past year to start things off on a lighter note I want to give a shout out to the AWS who came together with a fantastic wrestling series about me and the channel we're in a series of videos I'm fighting Tyler the Creator MC ride appears it's absolutely bash insane not only because of the the weird wrestling matches but my favorite my personal favorite thing about these videos the amazing announcing rock doll then I went to Primavera Sound this year that was really fantastic festival and it reminded me that maybe I should make the effort more often to make it out to a festival or just more shows in general this coming year you know I'm just really sidetracked with a lot of personal stuff and and I didn't go do enough concert so the concerts I did get to are the ones that at least stuck out to me the most savages in New York City who were fan-fucking-tastic and then Kumasi Washington in Washington DC caught him over there and and those are definitely two of my most major concert highlights of this year got a new website going which has been pretty great still ironing out issues with that but hey shout out to my buddy Austin who does a lot of updating over there updating on the Facebook page also shout out to my dude Jeremy who edits quite a few of the videos that you do see every week week week week the channel surpassed 500,000 subscribers which is great also 100 million views which is great Jenny death when Jenny death this year also this channel got its first review that surpassed a million views my review for the Kendrick Lamar Record to pimp a butterfly also we have the new kal mixtape which came out this year and got way too many hits on the audio Mac website and actually it surpassed in popularity and streams a lot of legitimate mixtapes that were put up onto the website I'm sorry this was a huge mistake this should not have happened it was one of the most terrible things in music that happened this year the name ffunny meme tanto memes were pretty funny the anthony photoshopped into album cover memes were pretty funny so we had some good memes this year also I got the podcasts going this year interview podcast which has been pretty great it's it's not like you know the super crazy viral thing but I'm actually really happy to sort of have a little corner on my youtube channel on the Internet where I get to just have interesting conversations with people whose music whose art whose YouTube channels I admire and I think they're doing interesting things and I think it's great to sort of give them some exposure and also just kind of see what makes a lot of these people tick because they're cool interesting people they're doing cool interesting things had a great Boston live show had a great live event down in South Carolina thank you to the radio station down there sister yard radio for bringing me out there and yeah you know that's that's the stuff that I wanted to name-drop that I wanted to mention in this video and yeah it's been a great year heard a lot of great music and I hope you check out some of the music I mentioned in this video but get real psyched for the music I'm going to be mentioned but get real psyched for the music I am going to be mentioning in the next few videos favorite EPS favorite singles favorite albums your the best love you forever [Music] "

everyone Anthony Phan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and you're listening to the latest episode of the needle drop podcast we do a series of interviews discussions with content creators musicians youtubers of various sizes and shapes and on this episode with me I have mister D respect of the D respect YouTube channel and also the double D's podcast I had his co-host of that podcast dumb on the show earlier this year and easily the worst guest I've ever had but you already you you already know all of his problems well they were well aware of all the fucked up the greenroom over here and you know that over here that at the needle drop podcast we have very good amenities and you've seen them you know and yeah and and he totally fucked up the room he half ate a lot of the food and then just put it back down on the tray like a total slob and he's never going to be invited back ordered a jack and died in that did all the things that Dominic Reverend normally does well look I think one thing's clear you had Dom on the podcast and then you realize you said well okay well let's get this thing right what's it let's get this thing right let's get the on this and I think Dom would agree that the it was a Rachel exactly exactly the this were and by the way I don't believe that Dom have a anything but we had a lot of food laid out you know and it seemed like he just got distracted by some food while he was in the midst of eating other food and he would stop and he put it down and I think I just caught him in the middle of a bit of a binge so he had just kind of you know left the room in a bit of I don't know a fat man tornado or something it was pretty disgusting but we're going to move on now this podcast that we're going to do it's not an interview though you are a very interesting person I find anyone intriguing who regularly refers to himself as daddy but uh but we're going to actually be talking about something else and maybe I'm getting a little ambitious here but I'm going to call this the the first annual cuz because maybe there won't be another the first annual worst rappers out right now I went on Twitter I would I went on my social media and I basically asked you guys what were some of the worst rappers out in your opinion and and I got a lot of repeat answers and I took the artists that were the most repeated and I put them into a list and I decided that we were going to talk about these artists on this episode of the podcast now he's not in the list but he will get an honorable mention Kid Cudi is not on the list he's not he's not on this list even though I personally have a distaste for Kid Cudi especially his latest record which isn't even a rap record it's a rock record really he is not on this list because nobody really suggested him I when I asked the album of his that the new album had not come out yet so maybe he wasn't at the forefront of everyone's mind right now but but again on that record he's not really rapping but we do have ten pretty polarizing artists on this list and I think we will just kind of go down this list and talk about maybe some of our personal opinions of these artists but why some of these artists are kind of hated so much generally because a lot of the hatred that some of these artists get I think has very little to do with their music actually I don't if you feel that way I think it has to do well before we started the podcast I mentioned to you that I think actually just with one I think it's solely about his music but yeah for the most part it's that there's other components that goes to it one okay well that'll that'll be interesting okay so so let's get into the list the first person on my list and this is the list I sent to you is I have taiga listed here and and and he to me is a prime example of an artist who is hated more for his personality his antics his reputation more than he is his music because his music I I don't think he's the worst rapper on the block but he's pretty generic there's nothing really about his music that sticks out to me as being supremely bad really just more trendy than it is awful I don't know if you feel that way it's vanilla it's it's just normal it's write down the missing really stands out there's nothing reveal it to hate there's nothing really to love it's just right down the middle it's just straight for yeah it's it's it's very water bread but but the thing is this I think is is really important about hip hop music I think when something such as charisma plays such a huge role in the the artists success and the likeability of that artist of course everything that they do outside of their music is going to kind of be held up to scrutiny what he was doing with Kylie Jenner before she had turned 18 the all basically all the elves he's taken over the past several years in the public eye just looking totally ridiculous I believe I saw him served two summons at like a sneaker signing or something which was a pretty ridiculous video this guy had walked up with all these sneaker boxes like he was just going to buy them and then tag it was like and assign them but then he just handed him a summons walked away which was um which which was pretty raw but I don't know I think I think taiga sort of falls short of this really sort of successful masculine macho ideal that a lot of rappers live up to that a lot of rappers sort of put forward but it seems that for whatever reason he can't keep that facade up because obviously these people are all people at the end of the day none of them are perfect but for whatever reason Tyga just can't help but sort of crack in the public eye a lot of the time I think you touched on it man I think he's just getting grouped up into that sort of that reality show that TMZ wave I mean with the involvement that he that he had with Kylie Jenner I think that's where he's associated with the other show on MTV I think it's called like King Tiger something like that I've never seen an episode of it I don't want to see an episode of it and that's sort of his niche right now his niche is his music isn't at the forefront of what makes tiger tiger it's just it's just his antics what he can get into I didn't really even have a full grasp of exactly what it is that he did he dated her at the time when she was technically a minor and then continued dating her afterwards for a little bit okay well yeah I mean yeah that's the thing I mean I how many have you ever reviewed a tiger project um I have talked about his music in the past his latest project which actually was kind of another moment where he embarrassed himself a bit in the public eye he had available originally I think only exclusively on title I believe it was and and as a result there were all these people that couldn't get his music because it was essentially behind a paywall and then once the album was initially available it had only sold like you know maybe a few thousand copies so everybody had a huge laugh at that and that's another thing it just kind of seems like in an age where people aren't buying albums sales simultaneously the music listening audience will turn around and laugh at artist for not selling enough copies of a record can adjust to the hard times how dare you yeah I guess you know but I but it's kind of like but but you didn't buy the album but you know if you are a fan of the artist but whatever Tyga just kind of like with his music I think it's pretty obvious as to why people generally don't really care for him and I don't really think there's too much to say as to why he's a I guess I guess sort of losing right now in a sense in the public eye he's also been dismissed by the Young Money meal ticket he's even getting this by Drake I mean uh what was it was it six God about to hit you with the work boy was the name of that record yeah it was it was the last track off of dry write right you know you haven't been a man in like a minute tons of shots towards tiger in it so maybe maybe that works into it a bit maybe he's been dismissed for that reason as well yeah I think so and I think it also goes back to that sort of reality show world kind of sucking him in I mean someone like Kanye West can make the move that he made because prior to getting involved Kim Kardashian he was notorious he had a huge reputation so he doesn't get sucked into that world and then sort of brought down a peg you know he's very much relevant in the music world despite the reality television world kind of co-opting him a little bit Tyga's reputation prior to getting involved with Kylie Jenner he was pretty much a one-hit wonder maybe a two-hit wonder and as a result I'm not really sure this was a great move for him because it essentially took away attention from his music but I think that he was kind of on the downturn already with a few unsuccessful projects and tracts so as a result of this this might have been a good move for him he might have extended his relevancy a little bit longer than it would have been otherwise but I think kind of as a result though he did get that extension his final moments have kind of been a bit of a crash and burn sort of that it's not the kind that he would want no all right so let's move on to someone who has is a bit more notorious think and and I think still has a lot of relevancy despite the fact that he has some serious haters and and that would be Chief Keef hmm now now he comes in at a really sort of interesting time in hip-hop music I mean I think prior to Chief Keef there were people like little bee there were people like waka flocka flame who essentially were hated across the internet for what I think some people saw is kind of the lowering of standards of hip-hop music you know the lowering of lyrical standards the lowering of musical standards and I think once Chief Keef came in he sort of proved that he could make music that was even more lower common denominator even more depraved and as a result I feel like all that hate that was originally centered on people like little be centered on people like waka flocka flame just came on to him with this laser-like intensity so he lowered the bar so much that he was successful he just did it just yeah yeah I I think that was it you know I I think that was part of it I mean of course it sort of has a lot to do with sort of the persona and the lifestyle that he puts forward in the reputation that he has in Chicago as being involved with these violent criminals and so on and so forth and and I think a lot of people dislike that as well because some people will kind of cry foul and say well somewhat please think of the children you know and something like that but I think that I I think that this is an artist here that uh that I can mostly say people dislike for his music Diana and I think it has to do not simply with his music for some people being just generally unenjoyable but I think some people really dislike the fact that again that he's kind of lowering standards a little bit in a genre that for a long time has been very insular and very much obsessed with its standards standards that people had perceived guys like Eminem to have advanced because oh he's such as he spit so fast t is such introspective dynamic and in really detailed lyrics but now it seems that in the Internet age those standards has just been smashed apart by artists who are just kind of uploading their own shit to the internet there's no standards anymore you know everybody it's kind of the Wild West in terms of what people want to do rap wise and and I think that he's kind of a proof of that in a way and and in a way I think for the better but simultaneously there are a lot of people out there they don't want to let go of those standards so easily part of the frustration I think also goes into the fact that you would think that somebody like Kanye would understand these standards because he's Kanye West and you know obviously the music that he makes most of those people who hold the hip-hop artists up to that to that very same standard expect Kanye West to not only be able to make that music but be able to cosign music that's just as good as is and the fact that he co-signed Chief Keef I think goes into the frustration just a little bit more because it's like from from a fan's perspective it's kind of like what Kanye look at this shit that sure look at what you're putting on a pedestal and then newer artists are kind of saying well if this is a music that I had to make in order to get a cosign from a large artist I would have done this a long time ago like this is total shit this doesn't take any talent whatsoever so as I Kanye go he's to blame for this well I will not a hundred percent but you know he he's got a lot to do you know with obviously with with uh you know shit I don't like and also in that video it G keep just has that look you know that Chicago youth look you know the the the the dreads in it's a you know it's a it's something that it's unfortunate but he's just has that look of so many kids in that inner city that are just you know just killing each other by the dozens every day and you know just in a root what was it was like a room with about I don't like 20 the shirtless guys who just look like chief Kia clones it's it's not a look appealing to East Coasters like you and I it's it's not appealing to the dudes and hoodies antennae know who D's in Carl Hudson oh no we don't know we don't do that are they a little do they don't yeah so yeah okay so so yeah and that's that's another piece of the puzzle there that you just brought up that kind of slipped by me that's that's true Chief Keef was in a sense kind of put on by that Kanye cosign prior to Kanye I mean some of those videos in his defense did have a lot of views and he had people like Gucci and he had people like walk of fuckin with his music but that was essentially kind of Kanye bringing him into the focus of I guess kind of the white music media whoo right after that cosign really just had a field day with covering him either doing these kind of long-winded videos or they're kind of exploring the dark underbelly of the Chicago music scene to this really awkward video that I saw were like him and Donald Glover trying to have a conversation or something it is just the most painful to watch thing I've ever seen in my life yeah like he just wasn't responding to any of his questions and all of a sudden they just kind of like started talking about belts and then it just got weird oh yeah episode I mean it is is that an attempt to sort of um I mean I I mean I should really be asking you this question because I find Keith to be so horrid that I would even question Kanye's co-signing of it and just kind of say like was it just an attempt for you to just stay relevant and just to put your imprint on something you know you know I'm saying like it works the answer to that is yes the answer is yes you think the answer is yes sir is the is this actually something that he fucks with no I think the answer is yes I mean I think he fucks with it but I think he fucks with it because it's trendy you know and Kanye has always been into stuff that is trendy stuff that's artsy and and while I understand your argument that okay you know you're an older artist you come from here you've worked with a B C and D you understand the standards but simultaneously Kanye has smashed a lot of standards and has been held back by a lot of standards too I mean from the go you had people who hated on him for his fashion choices you had people who didn't like the fact he was kind of taking it back to kind of a jazzy or soulful sample-based sound you had people that were not happy with the fact that he kind of went dance and electronic music on graduation you had people that didn't like the moves that he made on 808 so repeatedly he has made moves that had at least soured some people in his fan base but simultaneously have kind of expanded his fan base as well it seems like with each record he cuts a chunk of his fan base off by disappointing them but then gains new fans with whatever new sound and hype he's created off his latest single off his latest record right but it's but but those were at least ambitious you know those were ambitious attempt you know to say and then to just go okay yeah III see that you know at the point that he embraced I don't like trap had already kind of been an established thing it's it's not like he's inventing a new sound nothing like that though at the time you know when he came out with records like 808 he was very much pulling from guys like Kid Cudi so it's not like you know those sounds came completely out of the blue it's sort of like he grabs onto these protegees sort of like Travis Scott right now and he kind of hops up all these ideas and all these influences from them and then once he's done he kind of moves on to another artist or something like that and I think that was kind of the case with Chief Keef I don't know if he's going to continue working with him or continue working with this auto-tune trap sound with his future stuff though it does seem to be really relevant at this point still so I'm not exactly sure if he's going to kind of push that sound away or continue to embrace it but yeah I think that kind of exacerbated the problem because that gave Chief Keef exposure to the very crowd of people who didn't want to hear the type of sound that chief keep was making at all yeah and I'd also like to say and I'll say this about a few people and I'm going to say this at about Keith I don't understand what the fuck he's saying so that goes into it as well just plain I don't understand what the fucking thing dude that just that's that's something that we're going to be able to talk about with a couple guys art is soo more of a mattock I just don't I don't understand what you think sir I don't understand what you're saying but the thing is I'm really I think I I think that's something that that doesn't matter so much anymore you know I think hip hop's kind of gone through this really weird phase where it's more about the emotion or the intensity or just the sound of the voice more than it is what you're saying kind of like rock went through with the era of alternative rock or punk rock or metal music where you even have guys that are just gutturally screaming and you know just making these really weird monstrous throat noises but it's just really more about the sound than it is about the message and and and I realize that's you know a really tough thing for hip-hop to give up considering the message has been so important to the genre for so many years but but nowadays with not only Chief Keef but even Death Grips to an artist that I like you know unless you're grabbing a lyric sheet or hitting up rap genius or something you may not know every single thing that the artist is saying but but this this next artist is someone who is also polarizing but his lyrics actually are very easy to understand I know you've made a video about him before on your a.d respect channel which I will try to link to that down right if I remember - I'll try all six of you tried that though that meant to succeed we have McLemore over here as the next artist who actually got a lot of people telling me that they hate McLemore when I review McLemore they tell me why do i review McLemore he's garbage why do you like McLemore he's garbage my positive review of the heist is actually one of my more notorious reviews because people be like I can't believe you like that record but was so funny when that album came out it was not hot record and everybody was pretty neutral on the album and there wasn't really anything polarizing or controversial about McLemore it even seemed that the indie scene that now hates him was relatively positive toward him especially after that same love single which before it charted it had a little 7-inch release on Sub Pop Records which is a pretty huge indie label and it seemed like the record was just going to kind of go under most people's radars with without really grabbing any attention but then he came out with that fucking thrift shop video and that just rocketed him off and it seemed like once that happened once he got that mainstream acclaim there was just so much more scrutiny than there ever was before and when he had all the eyes of the music world watching him he just totally fucked up on that Kendrick Lamar thing and instead of just shutting up and taking his award it seemed like he just wanted to do nothing but apologize and then you had that huge thing what was it with that I was going to say the the the weird Jewish costume and then you had the the gay community kind of getting at him and sort of accusing him as as having just capitalized on their suffering in their community by coming out with the same love single though again in his defense he came out with that song long before he had a hit music career and there was no way he could have predicted that that song would have been as popular as it was he was on a very independent come up so you know I'm not really sure he's not like this manufactured music industry artists but he just happens to be this I guess very model like white guy who can rap pretty well and put together a coherent song and it just makes him infinitely marketable and that's where that that's where the problem comes in the I think the problem comes in is um you know it's just the appropriation of everything it's just he doesn't what you know people feel like he doesn't have the right to come in and of course you know I could refer to Lord Jamar of Brand Nubian who was just like the the main person that was just an t I but you know after after Macklemore height you know it wasn't really when it was when the Mac were more thing was really going on but it's just the fact that he comes in and he has this opinion of well let's make a pro-gay song I think that's where that's where the purists really and just the fact that he's white of course now it's like well he doesn't have the right to do this and look at the message that he's bringing in here it's you know it's it's almost like the idea of um of uh you know like a you know governments can't they can't implement change just overnight it has to be done you know gradually there has to be a process to it and I guess they looked at it in that same way like this is just way too random this is a white guy this is a white guy who's coming with a message that is an T does even down to the words of your most will not conscious artist but your most um celebrated artists let's say that your most celebrated artists who use certain words in you know in in in certain contexts don't necessarily mean you know um referring to homosexuals but even those artists use certain words that it's it's all about you know faggot disadvantage I think that's where McLemore gets so much hate and this sort of I think you what did you just say just now you said of this pretty nice white dude with you how do i I said he I said he's very uh mom exactly if you know it sort of you know feel that you get from a club or sometimes especially with the whole apology thing that he did repented it's it just you know he's probably a great guy but it's just everything about him just sort of pisses people off yeah that's sort of another side of the coin that I didn't just bring up there and and and sort of coming up with a hip-hop song and okay so sure there are artists who may in a very lacks way use the word faggot in their songs just kind of a general insult but you know we can't ignore the fact that traditionally hip-hop has not had the most positive of relationships with the the gay community back yeah we have yeah and and and you know we can even cite people like care as one is have Hadding as have he's had bars that weren't really positive toward women sexually readiness at bars yeah yeah like even MF do has had bars that sort of make fun of homosexuals a Tribe Called Quest on a track that until it got revised and actually went on to the the low-end theory was anti homosexuals as well I believe actually a member of Brand Nubian was on that song so Lord Jamar may have been just like you know completely one percent on board with that track and and then when they were told to change it they just ended up making an anti record label song so of course you know the the the the history there is is a little negative it's kind of a negative history so Macklemore being a white artist he's already kind of even if he is talented he's already kind of treading on thin ice and that for him to come out with this song a very popular song you know not just any song because certainly before that track I believe MERS even had a track that sort of addressed homosexuality and homophobia and I believe he actually even sort of played in the video a gay man and sort of kissed another man in the video you know so it's not like this is the first time anybody in hip-hop has tried to stand up for homosexuals Kanye has to though not so much in song as much as just kind of telling rappers publicly you know quit it with saying faggot all the time you know it's not helpful it doesn't you know really say anything and it's really disrespectful to where people that don't need the disrespect but for Macklemore to be white and then sort of have such a popular song going so against that macho heterosexual grain it's sort of given him enemies on all sides not only the gay community accusing him and just kind of the I don't know the progressive community accusing him of sort of capitalizing on this group of people but then also the hip-hop community for kind of bringing up a subject matter that that nobody who is seen as kind of a talking head in the genre an important figure in the genre thinks is kind of a kosher to talk about and kosher to advocate for you know when I when I made a video about Macklemore a few years back you know what one thing that I said about Macklemore in this Matt mackerel has something brewing does he or I mean he just came out with a single recently so I imagine there's probably an album on the way no I think he suffers he also suffers from something that someone on this list to uh if there's anybody out there who listens to the double D's podcast they'll know probably who I'm referring to and I'm not gonna say his name you get you guys make fun of him so much and I love it and then we're gonna get into it I think he suffers from uh it's just it's the just being preachy not as heavy as that other person but definitely being preachy and you know hey I've got a song I'm making a song about materialism and this is it this is a very grand statement this means a lot to me and he put so much into these records it you know which is not to say that they're not good but it's just you can easily see how uh how well informed a smart uh hip-hop fan would listen to it in kind of a way we know what Macklemore Justyna just fuck you I mean you you make everything he he really he puts it out there really in a in plain view so it's not like he doesn't he doesn't really disguise what it is that he's trying to say I think it's it's the issue with him he puts it very very bluntly it's it's all out there and my thing with him that I sort of suspected is well what's the next project gonna be like is every song sort of gonna be just like a grand saying each song has a hot-button topic that he's going to try to leave Boston you know and like yeah well I mean in his defense I will say that his latest single does kind of feel like him moving in the direction of making music that seems like it could just generally be listened to and enjoyed and doesn't have to have this really pertinent issue that we're all kind of see I I have I have a feeling that he's into probably not going to have a song about Syrian refugees on this next record I'll just say that I think he'll probably play to that pop audience that mainstream audience more since that is most likely the audience that is going to continue to favor him I think if he tried to play to the conscious crowd to the hip-hop crowd to all of those groups and and I think it is cool he's done kind of you know referencing the old school involving the people that he did on this latest single but but I digress I think he'll continue to play to that pop crowd and switch you understand it will still he I don't think he can win I think that'll make him even more hated because it's like oh you see he just use this as a stepping stone that's elite and now do you know it's no it's true you know and and that's the thing you know I think he'll continue to play to them but sort of making that move understanding that the people who hated him before are probably not going to still like him you know I think all that really matters and all that should matter to him at this point I mean if I were him that's the only group of people I would be caring about entertaining because that's probably the group of people that are going to ensure that his career lasts another two years you know trying to turn around and please the Lord Jamar's of the world it's just not going to happen even if he came out with the most amazing hip-hop record in the world like he he still wouldn't be fuckin with it because even Lord Jamar is a guy who admits that he has his biases you know he'll admit that guys like Eminem are really technically proficient he's most definitely talented but there's nothing about his music or his style that appeals to him you know and and I think in hip-hop especially who you are as a part of that and McLemore can't change who he is even if he comes out with an amazing record so uh the this next artist is kind of in I guess similar hot water that similar kind of cultural appropriation water and that would be Aghios Elia who has had a pretty rocky past couple years with numerous artists just kind of clowning her ti I believe is kind of cut off all ties with her on social media she's put her foot in her mouth countless times and not only has she just taken so many Elle's in the public eye which of course hurts her reputation and makes her so much less likable but a lot of people hated her right out of the gate just for what I guess you could call a bit of a vocal blackface with the fact that she's from another country she's outside of the US and she obviously does not speak with a southern accent she's very happy to totally embrace one when she's spittin a verse yeah and that's where her Macklemore sort of they part ways because that's definitely something that Macklemore never got across yet that's IIIi think I think there's no other I think there's no other reason other than that I think I think it's a reason that she intentionally goes out of her way to to speak in that tone though all of it if I'm not mistaken I think she's she spent some years I think in the south somewhere was it was a Texas I think she lived out there for a little bit of Atlanta yeah yeah she did but you know she obviously still talks like she's from Australia so I think it's nothing other than that I think the parrots it's it's pretty simple and then it's it could also be the fact that it it seems like something's trying to be its something's being sold to you I think when you're when you're a white female but wait a minute she's got an ass exactly like Nicki Minaj's so you know I think something's being sold to you here and it's a it pretty much that that thought that that very Afrocentric people have where it's like you know for example of the Beyonce wouldn't be as relevant uh if she was in his light as she was you know you know like those type of things so so it's sort of to say well if Nicki made it to the height of you know to where she made it where would I be make it because she's white and she's got a nice body and she speaks the way that she speaks I think there was an attempt theory it's kind of like when somebody makes when somebody what when when you when you're watching an Oscar baiting film you know just something that comes along right before Oscar season and it's it's a guy he's he's like retarded and and he's he's got like one leg but he's gonna save the world and you know there's there's this epic music and Ron Howard directed it you know what I'm saying so that's what it is to be Iggy's something she's like Oscar baiting and she's if something is being sold to you and it just doesn't work though I will say that just like one Iggy Azalea record and there's only been one there's only been one that's black and I don't know why I don't I have no clue what the way are you are you saying Iggy Azalea that it it Iggy Azalea being inserted into the the sphere of hip-hop is sort of like coming together with some kind of movie around Oscar time that is going to pull your heartstrings because the main characters disabled well you are is that we are is is that is that the metaphor going with you understood what I was trying to say basically what I'm trying to say is is that there there is an attempt it's very contrived I think it's it's very contrived it's it's we're gonna take this female she looks a certain way she's obviously he's not the worst artist out there people try to paint her out to be that but she's I don't think she is but it's just the look of it the look of her I guess is no I mean I that's what they're trying to get across to you it's like buying into her you know that I agree with you um I think that there's I think a lot of the language a lot of the arguments against her especially when it comes to the fact that she's white when it comes to the fact that she's kind of culturally appropriating this voice I think those arguments are valid but it kind of needs a bit of a reframe when it comes to I guess her relevance in the fact that she's white which means she can surpass Nicki what I would not but obviously I don't think I know no but yeah I mean that's a thought that's an argument that's an idea that a lot of people have in their heads I think maybe in the 2000s this argument would have been more relevant around a time when a guy like Eminem I believe he had that song leaked where he was talking shit on black women what was right that was kind of like this big yeah and there was this huge uproar about it but the fact that he is white the fact that he had so much influence in the industry the fact that he had so many people in the hip-hop industry on his side and the fact that you know of course he's talented came out with records continually that his fans loved he sort of overcame that but somebody like Iggy Azalea despite the fact that she's had huge hit songs she's not outside of the grass of the the hip-hop Halcyon you know the the big wigs and the people who in hip-hop music are concerned with things like cultural appropriation are going to be there to stand in her way and make her look ridiculous especially in the age of social media where the more the Chi talks and the more that she puts herself out there the more ridiculous she makes herself look so uh so I guess the point of trying to make is for sure she has crossed loads of social boundaries in the public eye and it's just been kind of interesting to sort of see all of these sort of predictions that she's going to be ruling hip hop because she's white in the next few years kind of not come true in fact what's happened is she's kind of crumbled and just been made to look ridiculous over the past few months and and really only because of her own actions well I think it's I I think there's always going to be uh there's always going to be a protection people are always going to protect her hip-hop and I think it's always going to be relevant to to people of color it's always going to be when it seems like it doesn't when you see McLemore I didn't I never thought that with Mack I never thought that so you know it they were presenting matter more as this white guy and of course he is marketable but there's a skillset behind it and there's an idea that's being expressed you know allow I'll admit that I think it's a little too grandiose at times but there's an idea that's being expressed with her I think it's still relevant because obviously again I'll go I'll go to her look I'm just saying you know obviously with the fact that she's got a you know she's got out of the surgery done there was something that was that that was being presented to you that that was supposed to be comparable to a to a Nicki Minaj and it was only supposed to be in opposition to that because of her skin color there was nothing that was offered musically I think that was any different it was just here's a different look we're going to have her compete with sure and and I definitely think that that that that's a lot of the reason why she's why she's hated hmm yeah it's it would it would seem that that that that would be how she's being marketed but I I think even if that was intentional even if it wasn't intentional that kind of would have been the way it was perceived because I mean what other female rappers out there right now are as relevant or as powerful as Nicki Minaj I mean I believe you've even done a video about this yourself sort of talking about how the the crop of female rappers in the 90s was so much wider so much more diverse back then during that decade whereas now it's really kind of just slim pickings and even though I don't really respect Iggy Azalea as an artist I find it kind of ironic that the the community would kind of excommunicate her in a way while simultaneously decrying the fact that we we're where all the female hip-hop artists I mean even if eg Azalea is doing more harm than good in a way by making awful music there have to be a lot of female rappers out there who might have seen that and then maybe question themselves or maybe question that decision seeing how quickly a community would chew up and spit out someone like her just for you know not exactly conforming to whatever rules have kind of been set out in front of her though again I mean I don't like her music I don't defend her I think she's trashed generally and I think she's sort of made an ass of herself repeatedly but I just kind of find that scenario had no clue that see I broke ties with her how long ago was that um I can't remember it was definitely earlier this year and it was based off the fact that she just keeps putting a behind that you can find it so many times before you exactly you know and the thing is but the of course she makes him money but eventually she's going to say something so wrong that that that she's gonna be taking money out of his pocket you know because I'm sure it costs him money every single time that you know she says something dumb or does something ridiculous and he's got to come to save her and come and fix the problem but now it seems that you know she just kind of become a liability to him and he's kind of sent her out on her own and I mean my advice or my recommendation to her sort of like macklemore in the future if she's going to continue to have a music career I think she's got to continue to just appeal to the teeny bomber set and just not really worry about what the hip-hop community thinks about her yeah I kind of in a way sort of like um Drake's someone who I think a few years ago would have been on this list but I think right now he's seeing more success than ever after he's kind of gotten past this these feelings of wanting to be desired and sought-after and sort of a worship within the hip-hop community it seems like now that he's kind of turned a cheek and sort of doesn't care about their approval that they're more interested in them and they're more interested in him than ever and not that I think that Iggy Azalea can make that same turn that's it ah I know that I thank you what you're saying with that I'm I'm not I'm not saying she could make that same kind of turn but I think she can't see success if she stops caring about what people think about her you know because if she continues to play these games of identity politics and trying to kind of make up for the fact that people hate her for these very clear and very obvious and and a lot of times in a lot of cases very justified reasons she should just kind of accept the fact that she's a bit of a lightweight entertainer you know and just kind of accept that but the thing is a lot of these people get caught in their feelings because they want to be taken seriously as as real artists and and for someone like her I just don't think that's ever going to happen but you know nobody nobody's gonna look back on her and think of her in the same light as like Oh Lauryn Hill you know I just want to say I stand behind my my Oscar baiting retarded Ron Howard analogy like hey you you have you nobody took that analogy away from you I was just trying to clarify I said you've totally got that analogy you you you you've owned that analogy I was just double-checking so so let's move on to this next artist someone who I've reviewed a couple of times before and it seems like every time he drops a new project uh people are just begging me to review it because they know it's bound to be hilarious and and and you guys make fun of them quite a bit on the double Ds podcast as well uh Dom does really mean Impressionism um I I don't know what your improv I'm forgetting right now Meyer I don't have you know let me let me just say something here and because you just made me real realize something and I hope downselling DOM is a bit of a bit uh he's a bit stealer because whenever Dom has an impression I that's his impression I don't touch it I don't do Hobson but you know say if I try to do et hip-hop preachy you notice how Dom sorta does he goes on you know I didn't realize that no I realize I realize he does that but I like the fact that you guys go head-to-head on oppression and and I think I think it makes for an interesting segment on the podcast where it just essentially becomes the challenge to horrible impersonation go ahead present better polite up and in the artists that we're talking about is Hopson um someone who a lot like Macklemore like you were saying earlier is super preachy in his music and that sort of has this tendency to look down on others in his music and he's usually just so unapologetic and and sometimes like in-your-face and immature with it to the point where he becomes kind of annoying and it's sort of weird to think that me and him are sort of like at the same age because sometimes when I see him in music videos sometimes when I see him rapping I expect him to be kind of around the age of like a Tyler than hurry ater but even Tyler at this point isn't making the same kind of music that he was when he originally broke with some of his biggest singles and with that bastard tape and then with Goblin he sort of progressed on to something else a little bit whereas Hopson I kind of feel like is in that same judgmental really immature state that he's been in since he got popular and and I think as a result that's just kind of continually turned off more and more people every single time he drops a new record and my mind just instantaneously went to that one single that he dropped where everybody notoriously cites that one line over and over about the guy who invented college not going to college because that's just a monstrous revelation dude uh it's it's it's a wonder I I wonder what Hopson would sound like if he smoked weed I wonder what it would sound like you don't think no II toxic against you no I mean I really what was it an ill mine v did he take the blonde out he's like hey you guys get drugs judge bad guys I can only imagine what he could sound like I've never seen someone I don't think I've ever met a person in my life ever just did that that is so they're so not in a position to be handing people advice because of the way his mind works I you know of course he's he's he's and and obviously III can I know I can speak for you when I know that you acknowledge that he is a talented MC that's not what we're saying well yeah that's well that's that's one of the things that's so interesting about him being such a polarizing and such a hated horribly the best one on the comes to those probably the most well right next to one of the next on the list technically skilled he is incredibly technically skilled when it comes to those traditional standards of what makes for a great hip-hop artist he pretty much has it all but then he goes further to make himself so hateable with this music that I don't know I I can't help but think that unless you're a Hopson Stan and you take everything that he's saying is a gospel if when you're working maybe that's a requirement as well but unless you're a Hopson Stan who takes everything he says his gospel I can't imagine anybody listening to his music and not feel like they're being talked down to in some kind of way right yeah yeah and that and that's essentially the issue and like you were saying it's it's like being talked down to you by somebody who is obviously in no position to be giving out advice to anybody on anything I know a lot of people like to cite that tract where he talks about a sort of education in the world and religion and all that stuff but one of my least favorite hops and tracks is a particular song where he's going on nann about how he couldn't get with this girl and how he's a nice guy and nice guys finish last and all this stuff which is just such a pitiful fucking mindset and it was just really disgusting to kind of see it plastered all over this really melodramatic song I don't think you can come from the position of oh I was a basket case I kind of kept to myself but let me tell you what I think about the world it's like it seems like you have an experience the world I mean granted obviously he's been touring it but he's getting a whole different perspective of the world now that he's an artist you know I'm saying but it's it's it's teenaged angst I think he should call that his next album like it should really be a thing for him because that's what he's expressing he's expressing sort of these these emo thoughts that you know the kid in the back who's like surges doodling in the back of the class and has these dark feelings about the world and the very negative view on everything and I think he expresses this the best when he talks about religion because in that song when he got what was it was the ill mind seven when he was out in the desert and you know I'm questioning really powerful yes I think I'm questioning my faith you know I'm good if there's not gonna be an afterlife then I might as well have fun in this life I should have fun right I should indulge but it's just when you were when you were like 15 or 16 you had these thoughts like just the way his his mind sort of just unravels every lyric it's like you could put yourself in the position hey and maybe maybe to some degree maybe that's a good thing for him if he is trying to appeal to that to that edge not everybody's I know he's not well I mean well I I don't think he's intentionally trying to appeal to that age group but but he is and I think he'll sort of accept what and fanbase that he gets honestly I don't think he knows how to appeal to people were and and while when I reviewed that video I I guess I respected generally some of the ideas that he was putting across the way that you just kind of framed it reminded me and sort of made me think if these are the kinds of revelations that he's having now at this age and we're the same age like what has he been doing for the past 15 fucking years then right was he right writing he's been right like eating like a tedious bit riding those bars I've got to a better you to deny I agree you do do better et I do agree with that you you do get that et you to get the et quote though there was there was one I can't remember what impression it was now we're digressing I can't remember what impression it was you two stopped and you did a head-to-head on this one impression on one of the recent podcasts and I can't remember I was I felt overwhelmed that he go first and I kind of just gave up no no you know you know what it was you did um you you guys were pretending to be daniel plainview daniel plainview from their own okay okay i didn't know his life character yes yes yes you guys are pretending to be his character from there I I said sort of the line for the milkshake scene and Dom sort of just improv it yes and and I will say that I did like more that he improved and I think that he was trying to he was trying to live in the character but you were trying to just like recreate the scene I didn't play as the character yeah that's what I did I did karaoke I played it safe I did it but but uh to continue on with Hopson it's like he's been like you were saying sort of locked in his basement since age 15 and then he just kind of come out now that is sort of that without any sort of interaction with the world since then and he still thinks like Eminem is still high it's like it's like he should have been out in the 2000 you wouldn't really know he would really work for him back that it but it really it really really spells he still says things like you know like LM see you know doper yes I could see him having a conversation with somebody and so like you're not alerting me or something you know and and what what's so funny and and this was definitely my opinion and a lot of people sort of brought this up after he came out with a music video for this track but the one song on the record and I guess this will bring us into the next artist that we talked about the one song on the record where he's kind of parroting future and yeah thug is like is is is the best song on the record like it's it's definitely one of the better songs on the album so you kind of accidentally made a great song or at least a catchy song on the album by making fun of artists and sort of portraying hey this is really this is really easy to do I could do this but sometimes some of the most popular and and long-lasting musical ideas are sort of those weird dumb things that have kind of been sitting in front of your face the whole time and just kind of sound like these gimmicky idiotic little tricks that anyone can do but it ends up kind of defining some artists and in really creating trends that that make a lot of money and a lot of people like to hear because they're really a ear grabbing and and he just seems so pretentious and so beyond doing any of that stuff and yeah he's just kind of weird I don't know like I said anachronism because it sounds like this would have worked so much better in the in the 2000s uh but now he's just kind of uh he's new but simultaneously he's dated I mean when he first came out and he was kind of clowning Tyler the Creator and and in Kendrick a little bit I mean that was definitely fun and that was definitely funny but then I feel like the more songs he came out with the more he started to to sort of put out this idea that ham I'm gonna tell you what's what I'm gonna tell you what to do I'm gonna tell you what's good and what's bad and what's right and what's wrong and I'm gonna tell you all about my philosophy and the more that he kind of got into that just in like in this so that you got going here okay okay you go ahead like this by the the more they derivative god bless yeah well I might might that's that's where my Hobson impersonation comes from you I listen I I think that now let's let's set the record straight hops into the song hey nothing like that but you did a very good impersonation of Dom's impersonation of Hobson yes Hobson doesn't sound anything like that but given his songs and given his lyrics you would expect him to talk like that right so you know I mean I've heard him saying songs before I've heard him saying interviews before that you know if he and his friends don't like laugh at it then it doesn't go in a song or you know what he puts into his songs is just like kind of crazy stuff that him and his buddies think is really funny and you know he must keep a real close circle of friends because I just don't you know know what group of people would have thought the some of the stuff that he's writing is is hilarious and just kind of the the whole thing that him and funk volume did not too long ago or they challenged any rap group to like you know a a rap battle for like what like a half a million dollars or something just kind of shows how out of touch they are like dude like nobody wants to like rap battle you you know at least not any clique that's like you know relevant you're not going to get good music or like young money coming in and being like yeah we will rap bad like I'm an island actual bad lers make it maybe there's something there but yeah nobody's gonna challenge you and it and and and that's the thing you know despite the fact that Hopson is perceived to be this really talented artist artists do you think he could sort of you know walk into that battle and like you do well yeah he could definitely do that he he could uh I mean you know that there's I think there is a big difference between uh you know rapping acapella and you know rapping over a beat but I think I think in a battle format I think he could be I think he could be successful I think I think he could and I think he could jump into it facing some of the bigger names because you know he's obviously got a huge internet following bigger than I think any I mean who's the most the biggest our biggest battle probably somebody like murder move maybe he could just jump into it and just go right up against him and you know the numbers are right now would he beat him uh you know personally I don't think he would beat him but I think he would it would be a seamless transition I think a seamless transition yeah I mean he could get really I guess nasty really rely on the insults that come in his songs which sometimes are funny and it would probably keep him from getting super preachy because there wouldn't really be anything to preach he'd just kind of you know be attacking the person in front of him so maybe you know he could make that transition and it might actually end up be being more entertaining than just the records and and preaching this works in battle rap preach eNOS definitely does work although they do I mean what one of the biggest verses over the past five years is uploaded lux I think against Calico you know you go get this work where he was just where he was just basically breaking down the fact that the you know his opponent is a byproduct of of a slave mentality and you know he's his father was just another and said I can't believe I was just bout say n-word I did it this bothers just another nigger or you know so he yeah definitely that thing was preachy as hell and you know people loved it so I think that works in that for a minute hmm okay uh why I think we've explored Hopson as much as we possibly can so uh let's let's get a night is next to go ahead I'm Brownback lately for reminding my breath you know do you ever run into that issue where people listen to your podcast and and they assume that you're a white guy uh it's happened before it's happened before because I I have to assume that I think it's happened before on on since since you're clarifying right now yeah at the on D request videos I think I've said it like maybe what a few times I think I've said and then I've seen in comment sections it's like why the fuck is this cracker saying nigger you know it's it's happened before alright um let's get into these next two artists I mentioned them sort of a little bit it was a sub tweet it during our Hopson talk where he has that one song no words where he's essentially parroting future and parodying young thug at the same time these auto-tune rappers I guess if you could even call them that though I think they're they're really kind of more singers in their own right but still when when I ask people what I think the what they think are the worst rappers out right now they come up time and time and time again even though in my own mind they don't really fit in that rap archetype to me not just because I don't think they write great lyrics but mostly because I just don't think they're rapping you know I think they're singing really which is kind of ridiculous considering a it seems like that's what they're doing but it's not so obvious to people so that leads to conversations where I hear people talking about young thug and they're like young thug he's so great you know he like uses his voice like like an instrument man you know like and then in my head I'm just like like what like fucking singing like like you know like you know people are singing before they leave and I leave you not true man that dude it seems like that's the obvious thing to call it but people won't label it then people won't label him as a singer he's a rapper and and I think it has more to do with just his image more than it does with what he's actually doing um you know he doesn't look like and he doesn't carry himself like a Jeremih or like an August Alsina or something like that he very much looks like and carries himself like for the most part a rapper so I think as a result no matter what he's doing on record people take him as such and I guess on his previous records before he relied so heavily on uh on sort of the singing and crooning and auto-tuning like he does now he did rap on his earlier mixtapes but this style that he's kind of fallen into and he's kind of defined himself by it just goes so against the general rack rap archetype and I think that turns a lot of people off and and those same very same words go for future - yeah absolutely yeah it's it's easy it's easy to hate future I think he's he's the easiest person to hate on this list and it's because with exception to Drake who like you said he would have been a few years ago on this list he is the most quote unquote most relevant artist he's the biggest artist right now uh he's every he's everywhere here on the East Coast I mean did this past summer time you can go anywhere without you in commas it is that he has he has had one of the bigger years I think well he's had the biggest year of anyone on this list so especially with that Drake collaboration it's just it's easy to point your fingers at him and uh you know at this point he sort of he represents something he you know he sort of represents just like you said with you know he's he's this anti rap archetype that that that he puts across it's like he represents what people would think is is everything that's wrong I mean just the fact that you know one of the biggest records that he's responsible for this year is just him counting didn't is him counting money on the hook I mean that's a ten years ago when you know what when you had people who were you know very much a part of the whole lyricist lounge movement you know this back packing shit it's like you know the first thing that they would say like I don't care about how much money you got bro I don't want to know he's literally counting money on the hook you know so it's like it's so easy to make him for him to be hated and I don't think it's I've talked about him before I don't think it's anything that he does musically aside from what I hate from future me personally what I hate from future is his voice fry his vocal fry I hate I hate this sort of yeah it's it's something that little Wayne used to do but I don't know with future it's like turned up just a little bit more with little Wayne when he was kind of originating that a little bit it was kind of more of a side dish more than it was a main quarry track with future and with future it's just one note you know it's it's like all he really knows how to do but but the thing is it and I'm surprised I don't know I mean I'm sure he makes quite a bit of money I'm just surprised his label hasn't just swapped him out and just put in some other dude who can do that too and then just decide to pay him laughs really that's an interesting fact I mean you're joking but but but like you were saying you know he does kind of represent and something because even even though young thug definitely has his own thing going a future is kind of seen I don't know is a bit a bit more like a godfather of that sound you know young thug definitely rides on the sound that future helped popularize for sure young thug is another person who I want to mention is guilty of the very same crime that Chief Keef is guilty of and it's the what are you saying I have no clue future I think I used to have that problem with him um but there's actually a future song that I wouldn't say that I necessarily like it but it's definitely growing on me it's um know the meaning you know he's just like you know we're to understand who I am you know you have to understand what I where I've been and all that stuff yeah he does he does future does have some goals Congrats on that one he's definitely yeah lyrics that he does have some audible lyrics especially on that dirty sprite 2 project he did have some audible lyrics there but still again the it's not like those lyrics are so young depth and those lyrics are so interesting that they could actually carry an entire project and again when he sort of paints himself into that corner he ends up relying on that you know you know sort of a vocal quirk with you know the auto-tune just slathered on to sort of carry the song along yeah I've seen Charlamagne sort of talk about him in a Vlad TV interview where he said you know people know the hook that's all that matters you know people sing along with that hook they don't know what the fuck he's saying or the verses but you know they know and they remember and they're stuck on that hook and ultimately that's what matters and and future is a very hooky artist young thug is a very hooky artist is this a proof of one yeah it's a bit of a two-for-one you know because because I think they both kind of work against that rap archetype in a very similar way even though they have slightly different vocal styles and I could pick out one from the other very easily to me I think they go against what a lot of people expect from a rapper merely based on the fact that I think they're more singers and they are rappers I mean of course you could charge them with having really degenerate lyrics and lifestyles and all that sort of stuff II shit that you know if someone's like a hardcore backpacker you know they would probably charge them with and just kind of call their lyrics trash and all that stuff but uh but outside of that I think that they don't really try to live up to the rap archetype so as a result if you try to have a discussion about why they're horrible rappers I mean of course they're going to come up short because I don't think they're trying to serve again live up to those blueprints live up to those measurements in any kind of way you mentioned something in a video I don't remember what it was I mean it may have been a review to one of these artists I mean I would imagine one of these ten people in you the way you worded it and I think that's what it is it's it I think you said something about like it's a race to the bottom that's what it made bit they're like creating something that's never been that no one ever wanted to achieve before and it kind of sounds like you know where we're being dicks by saying it but it does seem it does seem like they're there they're building towards just like lowering a standard it's like you're not even trying you're really not especially young but I would say the future future sound is is you know if you just uh you know if you gave me an option you know if I was going on a road trip and I just had to listen to one of them I would definitely just say just give me future just you know whatever um young thug is just is just zero effort being put in there and the funny thing to me about young thug is of course you know I can only speak from the eastcoast perspective and just just so many people that I've known that have just like hated southern music as I've been growing up and as many people hated Wayne even when he started sort of coming into his own and you know he lied about being the greatest I do think it's interesting that I'm gonna use another analogy here get ready for this one if you look at these guys like their pokémons right if you look at little Wayne like he's a-- he's he's a little wayne the devolve form of a little wayne would be a young thug so it's like people hated wayne so much and it's like okay well how about you you want to do with something that's even worse than a little wayne now because that's what you're getting you're getting somebody who is worse in every single way yeah it seems like that that's really interesting metaphor and analogy there and it had to review my answer it's it's it's an interesting analogy I I would say that I don't fully agree with it based only on the fact that it seems like young thug is certainly devolved in that he's kind of taking this one aspect of little Wayne and sort of relying simply on it but simultaneously he's kind of advanced it and made it appeal to the younger generation in a way that little Wayne couldn't so so so as a result I think he's kind of succeeded in a way but I think that sort of comes with the whole race to the bottom thing little Wayne is ridiculous and has dumbed down and as just I guess insultingly plain as he is these days in a way I think he's kind of a little too nuanced for some of the listeners who are really enjoying a young thug who are really enjoying a Fetty WAP and I mean obviously little Wayne's newer stuff it's not that great but if if little Wayne had restarted and was coming out with the Carter three today it would not do as well as it did in 2000's you know it would kind of sound like something that would be popular it would sound like Lupe in young man maybe not that extreme sure and it may be even right that extreme but it would kind of sound like something that's popular but you know maybe a little too you know busy you know it's it's it's not really getting to what people really want to hear in the song and that's the hook you know and to continue down that race to the bottom you know I think we have an artist like Fetty WAP who he's not on this list nobody really brought him up but just kind of bring him up in the same breath you know a song Lee trap Queen you know that song to me is just kind of like one long hook you know like that song it's almost like the hook on that song never really ends because it's just kind of continually the same melody over and over and over and over kind of like on the song my way too so and the thing is that's what allows these artists to be so OneNote because really all that matters at the end of the day is is the fact that the song is catchy and it's a club banger and it's a hit single you know and and I think the Internet age and sort of this new mixtape age has allowed us to embrace that aspect of the music industry even more at least when it comes to some artists because you don't even really need to care what the deeper cuts on your record sound like anymore people are just going to buy or stream the single if they want to buy or stream the single and then just kind of leave the rest of the tracks to I don't know gather digital dust somewhere on the Internet alright um going on to this next artist on on the list yes an interesting one um although I really don't have that many strong opinions about him though I don't really care for his music I just think he makes it if there's any artist here that I just think makes straight trash it's probably this one a French Montana and I just don't really know if there's anything else to say about him other than that you know I I don't think he's a terribly unlikable guy as far as his persona goes and as far as his uh I guess outward appearance goes and sort of uh the way he handles himself in the public eye though I will say I'm not like an expert in his come up or anything like that but outside of that I I the only thing I really don't care about her care for in regards to him is just his music I think he sounds goofy on the mic and I don't really think he has much in the way of songwriting ability so there's just nothing really there for me musically I think he's probably the most unlikable out of the the whole list I don't even really think he's trying I didn't really see much effort there sort of in the same way that you were kind of saying the future and young thug aren't putting in a whole lot of effort but then again he sort of is trying to live up to that rapper archetype at least a little bit and I think as a result the the fact that he's just not measuring up is so much more apparent because he's actually rapping uh well first of all I just want to say that I didn't think that that was the artist next on the list I did that Brent Fontana definitely is an interesting selection um maybe I just I put a different order but uh yeah oh no you know I I see what you're saying this artist is uh that other artist was next on the list we'll get him right after this but yeah French French Montana who I don't think we need to dwell on too much if they don't have it so I'm not a strong opinion just an old man east coast argument is is he's from the Bronx and he doesn't sound anything you know to Kin of anything around him so he's sort of you know obviously signing with with Maybach music and everything and he has a lot of ties is is he signed with them I thought you signed with puffy oh there's a there's like a maybe it's a distribution thing but he definitely is entangled in in in a in Maybach Music uh okay it's it's that and even more so right he's puppies artists and that sort of builds into the frustration to where I think it's a problem with with New York City's that he's probably the most relevant artist I would say and maybe a short second behind him would probably be fabulous who's still respected but still even fabulous that I heard a song from fabulous I think about a week ago I don't know if it was on a mixtape that he dropped just recently but he made a song um it was about narcos basically that you know the Netflix series so he made a song about Pablo Escobar and it sounds like something French Montana would make it was just heavy auto-tune and it just I didn't expect fabulous to do something like that but anyway but I think that's what it is with French Montana a lot of the hate that he gets is that he's uh he's an East Coast artist and he just that you don't hear any of it on him and I'm not saying that you should just because you're from a certain place you should have to sound like that but it's like if that's the only sound that's coming out of the city I mean it's pretty much the sound that's coming out of all the other uh all the other areas with more popular artists it's like they're already doing that better than you are why don't you show what we do over here just a little bit more is all I'm saying but he's not capable of it I guess yeah all right so moving on to this other artist who's a little more interesting I think we could probably talk about a little bit more length and my review of his latest record has been one of the most polarizing reviews I've done this year a lot of dislikes on this review and a lot of people hating on me over this review but the artist is little dickie when I asked everybody I heard that that I thought that worst when I asked everybody online but some of the worst hip-hop artists out right now were little dickie came up numerous times and that may partially be because my followers are familiar with my opinion of his music and they're familiar with my review of his music so maybe I've influenced some of that a little bit maybe he wouldn't have come up if another person online review had asked generally but he did come up repeatedly when I asked everyone were you terribly familiar with him before I sent you the odd no the only thing that I was familiar with was the you know save money yeah that's what I was familiar with um well I think little dickie I would I'm trying to think of anything I could say negative about his music that I didn't already say in my review or why people would just kind of generally hate him but I think uh I mean I I think it really kind of comes down to everything I said in my review uh but but but he's not really at this level of mainstream notoriety where he can kind of get the sort of flack that McLemore gets um and it seems like right out of the gate he's had quite a bit of I don't know quite a few endorsements from some really notable artists I mean he's got Snoop Dogg on his freakin record you know which which is kind of unexpected for an artist at his level and kind of that is a relevancy point those Snoop Dogg has never really taken up the opportunity to a Snoop Dogg has never really avoided the opportunity to kind of whore himself up do a party yeah whore himself out and do a party track or do a track with an artist who kind of appeals to that college crowd because Snoop Dogg snoop Dogg knows where his fans lie you know he knows I like that video by the way it is an interesting video sort of I don't know I guess taken as its own thing and not sort of brought into the scope of the the rest of the record but uh do you have any sort of struggle I don't have on on his music or strong opinion about him I mean I mean what I want to say is I think he's very technically sound I I am impressed by you know if if Andy Samberg didn't ever make music I I don't think I would there would be so much dislike because it does have sort of a Lonely Island that's that's really what it sounds like I mean uh I mean when you basically make it sounds like someone trying to it sound like trying to someone trying to make serious Joe make a song like ex-boyfriend when you just make a song about this guy my girl's ex-boyfriend his dick is just so big he's the most handsome guy ever and he just keeps repeating in this and it's like he's trying to be humorous but at the same time it's like he's I don't know if he's serious or you know whatever I mean I don't find it funny um but I think where I decide gonna say what I personally disliked about him because this is pretty much the first impression that I got from him and you know a lot of people have got a first impression by the you know the whole concept that he had that sort of uh you know let's make a video for uh for no money as little money as possible and it and to me what I didn't like about it was that he just he put this he showed you the function of how how it's done and it's just like in like this viral space that we're in I don't want that to be the very first thing that I see about you that you're going to show me the tactic of how you can make this big epic video and you can get so many fucking views and it's going to cost you so little money it's like I don't know I just I just didn't care for it I I didn't care for it I didn't care for that particular song but after I heard a few of his records I I actually would say that I kind of liked him a little bit but I can't take the music seriously that not sure if I'm meant to probably not but what and also I think the whole idea in the whole concept of doing a video for very little money is only a big deal for somebody who has the money to actually do a more expensive video I mean there are tons of people directors who I know and I've met who they have no other choice other than to the to make a video either on a no budget or a shoestring budget it's not really a big deal it's not a feat it's not impressive in any way there are tons of artists video video artists doing that every fucking day the fact that you're doing a video for no money it's it's kind of like I don't know it would be as interesting as somebody coming along being like hey guys I'm a white rapper and it's like okay well you know what's next yeah just didn't care yeah just didn't care for it at all and just um you know just sort of haggling people at the beginning I mean again I mean this is this is I I don't know if I would have said this had I been aware of who Dickie was beforehand but it's just the first impression that I got a Dickie was somebody who just you know and the rings on people's bells is like you're gonna do the Union just like oh yeah sure whatever I hey I got to shoot this video Mike this was privileged kid I don't know what he seems like he comes from money I know something about him tells me that he comes with money right yeah I mean I don't think stoop dog for free and I I don't know what his his label is but you know we did get into it alright let's let's finish this up we're on our 10th artist over here I believe his name is slim hey sue Jesus sy successful regan uh slim Jesus man I feel like he the this is an artist over here who as trashy as his music is there so little of it out so I feel like we have no choice other than to kind of come to the conclusion that it's it's really his persona it's his look and the fact that he's handled himself I mean I guess not too bad in the public eye it's it's just sort of so out of place to kind of see this white kid trying to play the role of a Chicago Savage in a music video and then before the music video starts put up a disclaimer that's like hey guys this is just a video and nothing bad Dong's going on here so don't call me my actual voice since losing that voice I wish someone came in and just narrated that uh yeah that that little put that little disclaimer before the video actually started you know I think it really would have been the girl Becky Becky snow is just right after it uh yet I you know I've spoken about some Jesus and I think one thing that he has that sort of unique from UM from all other white polarizing figures is he understands exactly what he is in this space in it you know in the space how people would perceive him and yeah just seemed so I mean and I'm just refer I don't have much knowledge about slim so a lot of knowledge that I gained from Slim was from that big Vlad TV um interview that he had after yeah and he's done a few well after it went viral and he was just so um he was just so apology it was it was almost disturbing to me to see a kid who yeah I mean it's it's it's a shitty it's a stupid record I mean he's got the disclaimer he's pointing you know like guns at a camera but he should be excited he should like I don't know why it's so wrong for him to feel excited and he didn't seem excited at all it was kind of like yeah hey yeah did that video um and and I don't really do any of that crazy stuff and yeah you know but you know it's so good and he almost seemed like ashamed of what he did like holy shit that went viral alright guys I know you're gonna be pissed at me but you know so he uh well that's what I'm saying exactly what I mean I isn't exactly how people are going to perceive him I mean I think even a black rapper would have probably played a viral song cool you know it's not not I didn't get cool I didn't but but but but i but I think um I I think the way he played it or the way that he reacted to it and and I think he really had no choice other than to do this was to just be really I guess forthcoming with the fact that he doesn't live this life he's not about this life and you know he's not from Chicago he's not a savage and you know he's just playing on the song you know this this song is not about real life for him and I feel like he had no choice other than to play it that way because if he didn't his life would have seriously been in danger a lot more relevant well I mean I you think so you mean you think if you think if he played it off like a road that way yeah if if he if he kept up the facade that he was sort of putting forward in the video you think you would it would have been more relevant but it would have been leading up to the to the world star video where somebody just like randomly knocks him out like stitches style honestly it would it's basically stitches really was what I'm saying he would be stitches um yeah so I you know well he obviously made the smart move I mean I'm sure he's a lot more intelligent than people give him credit for um but he made the move that wouldn't survive exactly what he does so not not the survival of his music career but the survival of himself you know I I do agree that the the fact that he that he did just come forward and sort of admit everything um you know of course killed the steam of the song and killed the steam of his career because because of course um you know he's de mystifying it you know and and as as much as we try to put forward the idea that you know hip-hop artists should be real they should be honest you know the often that's not really what we want that's not really the case because the moment in artists the moment a situation becomes demystified and it's just put out there and roll Ain speak and yeah exactly the moment you've broken the fourth wall and you've sort of spoiled the surprise for everybody nobody's interested in anymore and and that's essentially what he did he sort of put a pin in that balloon right away because he knew that if he didn't pop that balloon someone might fucking Papa o'clock Adam anybody put a bullet in hay-zu's his ass it's possible but it's um he uh he hasn't put out a mixtape or anything yet there hasn't been any me yeah there's nobody's put out a few songs you know he's had some songs out and some remixes and stuff like that but I don't think and I don't know if it's really gone beyond that so you know it'll be interesting to see if anybody you know really cares about a slim G's mixtape or slim jeans anything next year but I don't think that's going to be the case no definitely not you know with something similar after after bobby schmurder um you know put out hot negro let's say negro now um when he put out hot negro and he did a an interview with them losing Ginny boom boom I think um and he he he basically said don't do that he didn't say that he doesn't do it he said yeah he just lies to get rest he just said yeah don't do it which I guess isn't exactly the same thing as with some Jesus did which is which what reads off to people who really buy into no it's it's it's not the same thing and I don't think and I don't think that necessarily had a bad sort of reflection on his career at the time you know he was just very much like it's not worth it don't live the life that I live but you know the thing is people can continue to live vicariously through your music as long as they think in their heads like oh yeah he he really feels that way or he really does what he's saying or you know he really did what he was saying at one time or he at least knows someone who did what he's saying or something like that you know sort of like I mean I'm pretty sure that Pusha T isn't isn't selling you know Kia's anymore you know but but he's certainly uh I could say they look those back to that he's not going to say that he's not and he's probably not going to let up on that subject matter anytime soon pays that mortgage yep all right I think that's it for this list so that was that that was the first annual worst rappers out right now a conversation and uh let's let's try to have another one of these next Luke will loop back up a year from now and we'll have another one of these alright everybody thank you for listening this has been the latest episode of the needle drop podcast and my guest during this conversation has been the one and the only mr. d respect you could check out his youtube channel as well as his double D's podcasts down in the description below I want to thank him for coming on and this has been just a really good talk and I'm glad 
Oi-8UNm9d7U,haha King push is back everybody Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Pusha T album King push darkest before the dawn the prelude one half of clips president of good music rapper cool guy push T who had been having a bit of a struggle getting his solo footing ever since splitting off from his brother musically but he came shockingly close with the release of his last full-length album my name is my name a lot of deep cuts trendy deep cuts on that thing that I did not care for however still to this day I bang tracks like nostalgia and numbers on the boards so certainly there is still potential in a new Pusha T record even though there are a lot of people out there who have discounted him and sort of see him as being past his prime but that potential I'm looking for I'm not totally sure if all of it is going to show up on this latest project over here I did enjoy the lead singles teasing up to the release of this thing but this thing is merely a teaser to the full-length album that Pusha T is supposed to be dropping next year at some point so is push it going to reveal his whole hand on this new album over here give us his all and not really hold anything back for us to sort of be anticipating with his next album because I'm kind of getting the vibe of that off of this project which in a lot of ways is kind of like a glorified mixtape but still a lot of the material here is pretty sharp and relatively no BS push a T doesn't really give himself the time to fool around or do anything outside of his comfort zone so as a result this project is pretty no-frills the thing kicks off with a throwback to the days of clips with the same narrator that I believe I heard on hell hath no fury asking Pusha T if he wants to be a drug dealer or a rapper saying he has to pick one and this is kind of the duality of Pusha T the balance that he strikes on pretty much all of his projects is he going to be this drug dealer type is he going to be a bad is going to be a demon or is it going to be a rapper who saves the culture with his really sharp wordplay and occasionally a conscious song as well and I guess Pusha T continues on this project to show that he can like do both maybe not literally because I don't think Pusha T is literally snitching on himself saying that he's selling this much cocaine and so on and so forth but that certainly seems to be a theme he returns to again and again claiming that that is something that he had done in a previous life now lyrically Pusha T has the same distinct delivery that put him on the map in the first place this really spacious narrative flow where he's not really trying to throw a mess of words out there or anything because he's just working on and concentrating on making every single word and bar count with either a personal revelation or some deep references or some kind of double or triple entendre for one verse after another Pusha T essentially gives us a bunch of bold bars and proclamations like on the intro track here where he says leave your conscience at the door saying you know this essentially is not going to be any conscious hip-hop project or anything like that saying we've got the monsters in the floor I love the one line on here where he's talking about having hands in the white like chalkboards as well as they take samples of them I make examples of them and this is a pretty great verse to sort of set the tone for the rest of the project and the songs may be really straightforward with some pretty simple beats but the percussion is kind of off kilter and sort of progressive at points too in a lot of ways it kind of feels like we're getting a bit of a throwback to clips era Pusha T once he went solo I feel like Pusha T worked so hard to not sound like one half of clips but now it seems like he's more open to embracing his past and giving fans what they've wanted for a long time like on the song untouchable which has this really Basie eerie skeletal beat really prominent biggie sample on the hook the song lyrically is a lot of various cherry pick pieces of braggadocio from the past few years of Pusha T's life for the most part although there is one point where a line does stick out to me where he says let's take the scenic route I could show you some strange fruit or stranger fruit and it looks like Beirut given what just happened over there that was a pretty hard hitting line then with the track more famous than rich Pusha T essentially is exposing a lot of fake rich rappers and with the flow and the instrumental on this thing it kind of reminds me of my Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy era Kanye and it's no secret that I enjoy the music that I enjoy the instrumentals off of that record a lot so it's kind of cool does he push it to landing on something that sounds like it could have landed on that album that's also kind of the case for money pussy alcohol where ASAP rocky and Kanye West are featured on that track singing in unison on the hook a little lazy with the money pussy alcohol but I don't know it's kind of cute it's kind of endearing I like the the second verse on this track from Pusha T rapping about a girl who essentially was rejected by the guys in her neighborhood who regretted it eventually when they saw her getting picked up by sports stars with tons of money and so on and so forth I thought that verse was particularly poetic but back to this more famous than rich track the paid-in-full line toward the beginning of the track was killer and the line about snakes walking on the concrete was amazing - and how the rap fans are essentially getting hoaxed with all these visions of models and cars and stacks and and all that that were essentially handed it's like lifestyles of the rich and famous Elsa I love that one line where he says a no retirement plans no Derek Jeter's we all know I did it Rodriguez basically saying that you know we all know that he sold drugs just like we know that Aaron Rodriguez used steroids I could keep going on about a lot of these verses and a lot of these instrumentals for a short project I feel like there's an awful lot to say about it although there are a few hooks on here that I think are a little basic a little undercooked a little underwhelming especially Kalani on her hook toward the end of the album which I thought was a little long-winded and just kind of clumsy though I think she's a capable singer I just don't think the writing on that course was all that good I also think the song crutches crosses and caskets didn't really have that great of a chorus either although still I cannot deny lines like banana clips for you Curious George's that was pretty sick although again I think the lack of really defined and an expansive chorus is on this thing is all due to just how straightforward this project is supposed to be I love the Timbaland production on the song got em covered which is easily one of the most hard-hitting beats on the entire LP and it's so nutty and it's so kooky it's really in Neptune's throwback the young Dolf reference if you follow religiously any of the rappers whose videos are regularly posted on WorldStarHipHop was pretty interesting and then a series of bars talking about how rap fans or people who want to get into the rap game or following and admiring the wrong artists and there was this wonderful line on this track where pushed II said that you don't know he's a candle until he blows it or he blow it the song FIFA seems like another Clips throwback and and I don't know I I can't be mad at it I enjoy uh the the handful of clips throwbacks that this this project brings this actually sounds like an older track but sands push at ease brother especially with a really playful guitar line on this thing Pusha T is snide he's nasty he's charismatic as usual I love the very eerie and urgent and grimy kind of smoky and nocturnal track keep dealing with Benny Siegel that's great as well and the finishing track on here which has a great chorus from Jill Scott sunshine although I don't really know was going on with the background vocals on that track they kind of have this wonky dissonant quality to them that I think kind of ruins the heavenly vibe of the track and sort of the really serene feel of the instrumental here though this track is not all serenity it's actually more of a conscious and sad and somber sobering downtrodden track from Pusha T as he talks race politics Freddie gray and a plethora of other things to finish this project off I feel like I my name is my name he hinted toward doing something more conscious on a few moments here and there but it didn't really hit as hard as the more devilish tracks in the track listing here but I can't say that's the case for this song this is a really great ending to the album and definitely one of the more stand out songs on the project Pusha T definitely can move into this more conscious direction if he so chooses and it will be interesting to see if he embraces that a little bit more when King push eventually comes out again I like this project a lot it's definitely got me more excited for what's coming down the road then wrath of Kane did previous to the release of my name is my name so I mean I have no reason really to doubt what Pusha T is going to do at King push at this point this thing is in my phone I'm probably going to be going back to it repeatedly because it really is that good it really is that catchy in a lot of ways overall I enjoy it more than my name is my name even if there isn't a song on here I think is as great and as hard-hitting his numbers on the boards but who knows maybe it'll grow on me a little bit more I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing transition have you given the sound will listen 2015 album reviews are done they're over list week classics week coming up album views will resume once again in 2016 you're the best Anthony Fantana music wow 
82-PFGvojgU,ah hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Baroness album purple Savannah Georgia metal band Baroness on their fourth full-length album here with this release and one of the most respected grandest and most progressive sludge metal acts out there today and their last full-length LP green and yellow was a pretty huge undertaking given that it was a double album but a double album that saw mixed reviews from some hardcore fans because the band kind of changed pace change sound a little bit the tracks on this LP placed a larger emphasis on hooks and just a generally more psychedelic sound kind of reminded me what Mastodon was doing with the Hunter but maybe a little bit better I like the LP overall but undeniably it was kind of bloated if only we could get a Baroness album that brought forward this increase in melody more hooks but was hard-hitting like their earlier releases and sort of boiled the record down to its best elements rather than giving us so many tracks to pick through if that would happen we'd just be set and that's kinda what happens on purple some fans have even been observant enough to observe that purple being a combination of red and blue might mean that the band is fusing those two records together for a sound that sort of is the best of both worlds with their two earliest albums and personally I don't know about that I don't think this album quite sounds like that but I will say that I think quite a bit of the material here can certainly go toe-to-toe with a lot of Baroness's earlier work it's not quite as explosive or as aggressive as the red or the blue album but Baroness I think improved greatly upon a lot of the ideas they were experimenting with on green and yellow this LP flows incredibly well from the start to the finish as it just transitions from one anthemic sludge metal smash to the next the opening track on this thing Morningstar is a great kick off to the album the devil tight riffs on the intro really exhilarating and make me feel like I am just speeding through the clouds in the middle of a thunderstorm the track becomes really warm and melodic and harmonious during the solo passage it's awesomely melodic I think really easy to listen to for people who aren't really into more extreme forms of metal but it's also visceral and really overwhelming in the way that a great metal album should be this track is followed by one of my favorite cuts on the album shuck man I love the driving drums on this track what sounds like tremolo picked ours but you know really chunky down-tuned beefy stuff and it's really tense it just really keeps me on the edge of my seat with this track and John Bay's Lee's vocals his lyrics on this song in a better you Monday about yo shoot I I son that a little fast there and my voice did not really do it justice but the vocals the lyrics on this thing a lot of the time are very righteous and powerful poetic and vivid in their descriptions their moments on this LP where John is really channeling his inner James Hetfield and as long as I'm making comparisons here I think there's a touch of King Crimson influence on this thing as well as a little bit of Foo Fighters too to continue on this shock me track I love the grand harmonious ascending and descending chords that power their way up to the chorus which just kind of bursts with this shot bang vocal refrain and the incredibly righteous and triumphant tunes continue deeper into the album tracks that balance bombastic riffs and drums with some really melodic and beautiful guitar passages as well especially on kerosene which has an incredibly climactic ending though I will say one issue with these tracks and a few other tracks here is that Baroness and this is an issue I've had with their music in the past they tend to be really maximal when it comes to their instrumental layers which at times leads to some really weird mixing and instrument placement where the vocals the drums the acoustic guitars and the electric guitars kind of feel like in a standing position that they wouldn't normally be in in other mixes maybe the drums and acoustic guitar super literally loud while the vocals and electric guitars are kind of or in the mix the record trips into the very somber fugue which is like a little bit of an intermission in the middle of the album which was a pretty nice change of pace and the song chlorine and wine which is not only one of the heaviest and most powerful and harmonious songs on here but the tune at the core of this track I could see being stripped back to like an acoustic version and it would still sound great it has a bit of an old english medieval folk tune vibe to some of the melodies laced into it and there's a huge finish to this track too that I love now the last several tracks on here the album's final moments I think could have done with a bit more variety or another musical change of pace especially given that this record isn't really that long of an album we've got kind of nine full-length tracks running out at about forty three minutes the song iron bail I thought was a decent track but the very tense guitars and drumming on here it's really throttling it's visceral but it doesn't bring anything to the table that the previous tracks didn't already although I will say the song if I have to wake up is an awesomely powerful finisher which just has this powerful sadness to it that I don't often hear in a lot of newer metal music often the songs are kind of oriented around just insane levels of anger whereas this kind of pulls that veil back a little bit to reveal some serious emotional torture going on overall I think this is a great record and I'm really glad I got to review before the year was out I was kind of skeptical as to why Baroness would be releasing an album so late into the year but they definitely threw a 3-point shot as the clock was running out and really just pulled together a great metal record certainly better than green and yellow and again I think on par with what they put out in the past even if some metal fans don't realize it sure it is a bit of a change of pace and a change of sound it's still really hooky like green and yellow was but you can't deny that they're doing it better here and with bands like ghosts having a pretty fantastic album release this year it would seem that the core melodic fundamentals of songwriting are taking hold once again and some pretty prominent metal records in 2015 I love the tunes on this thing the performances are great the production a lot of the time like I said that instrumental placement could be wonky occasionally but it's more on point that it is off a lot of the guitar solos are great in really refreshing which is usually the case for Baroness no nothing new there and yeah I don't know if there's much else I can say about this album if you're looking for a progressive metal record that is also really catchy direct enthralling and engaging then give this album a listen I'm feeling a strong 880 on this thing transition have you given the sound will listen 2015 album reviews are done they're over list week classics week coming up album views will resume once again in 2016 you're the best Anthony Fantana music wow 
Numr-bT7e6w,I've never been in this situation uh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Willow Smith album Ardipithecus rock nation artist singer/songwriter and daughter of famed rapper and actor Will Smith Miss Willow Smith suddenly drops her debut album added nowhere here it is something I think most people would have expected about five years ago when the release of Willow Smith's original break out single wit my hair came out but after the release of this song it seems like she quickly sidestepped between pop direction she had been going in after fireball and 21st century girl it seems like she just hit the emergency ejector seat button on that aside from a couple mysterious soundcloud drops here and there she pretty much vanished out of the music world's eye but now she's just suddenly teleported in front of us with this new full-length album with a title and a cover that has kind of an evolution theme to it it seems that willow has taken this time of relative silence to become an altogether different and new music artist following this evolution over here where it would seem she ends it like some dr. Manhattan looking physical form sure I didn't really even expect this record to come out so I'm not really sure what to expect of it all I know is that I'm probably not going to get another radio smash on here or anything like that she's obviously gone out of her way to not define herself as just a tween Billboard chart topping pop artist on this one so what is she doing instead not not anything I particularly enjoy the opening track on this thing is easily five of the most pretentious minutes of music I've had to sit through this year it's so convinced of its greatness it's so convinced that it's making some kind of grand poignant urgent state that we all need to hear some kind of self defining statement that's going to solidify Willow Smith in our minds as a legitimate weighty thought-provoking artist we're right out of the gate she drops this line classification an organization or oh I dunno by Jove odd right now right side which is like the biggest truth bomb that anyone's ever dropped since Hobson's did the man who invented go to college go to college line came out on his last LP and she follows this line up with I said it like yeah I said it that really needed to be said but the track in a way is almost like a tale of growth about how willow kind of came to the point where she is now where she would be making this music talking about herself the fact that she's a teenager talking about being afraid to do things like I guess the singing and the rapping that she's doing on this record but kind of being encouraged to do so and now she's come to this point and she tells this tale and many others with these really yell P grading vocals that I'm kind of on the fence with in one breath I like that she's doing something really raw and in your face and and a little on the fringe her voice certainly has its quirks to it a lot of range although she doesn't have full control of a lot of that range as it seems like she's kind of just spinning out of control a lot of the time while she's singing and in another breath a lot of the time her singing just seems so convinced of its own arts enos and uniqueness I feel like she's turned onto some interesting things I hear notes of maybe a little bit of Bjork or even Robert Smith if I would even get ambitious enough to guess that she's listening to the Cure or something like that maybe even a little Alanis Morissette or something but sometimes her lyrics are so stomach-churning ly narcissistic I mean her words sometimes read like her brothers Twitter feed which is nuttier than a squirrel turd every attempt this record makes it sounding deep and artful it just sounds so out of touch and shallow like on the song natives of the windy forest which is pretty much just this indigenous music knockoff that's so short and half-hearted it might as well not even been on record there's quite a bit of filler on this LP so you know don't expect to hear too many well-developed songs from the beginning to the end of it's almost one hour run time then we have the song drugs with a Z because it's rebellious where I don't really feel like I'm crying with Willow Smith as much as I'm crying for Willow Smith on this track the production and this song is not unique in this is so painfully plain and musically rudimentary that I'm just not really getting much from this song but the track is mired in willows emotions her sadness her angst the angst on this album is so oppressive in such a focal point on this thing if you're not wrapped up in Willow Smith's emotional tornado on this record then I don't think this album is going to have that much for you because musically a lot of the time this thing is kind of a a barren wasteland that anybody with maybe about a year or so of experience in a variety of different dawes and electronic music programs could probably pull together anything that is on this album so again it's kind of a barren wasteland kind of a desert with the occasional snakebite of yeah yeah yeah but it's not so high-pitched and it's not so out there that it's like going down Yoko Ono territory or anything like that it's very safe despite the fact that it's convinced it's doing something artsy and experimental again I appreciate that it seems like she's trying to do something a little more out there a little more artsy with her voice she's totally in control of her artistic self but I think that control of self requires self-control and discipline which this album has very little of as it sounds like Willow Smith and whoever she's working with on the variety of these songs think that every noise that comes out of her mouth is great and just worth slapping onto the record and it's just not true very few of the tracks on here are well groomed and the few that do have very well defined verses and choruses and all that like the song why don't you cry are actually really awful when it comes to writing like really mediocre writing the lyrics and just the hook of the constant why are you anyway why don't you cry again unless you're really emotionally invested in Willow Smith as a person and you just kind of want to hear her narcissistically explore her young and angsty emotions on a full-length album with very little in the way of sonic or musical appeal then this album is for you but it's not for me I'm feeling a light too decent three on this thing transition have you given this album a listen and if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and smash the like you're the best will of Smith music Anthony Fantana needle drop forever 
DHaaMg8Owl0,hey everyone gingerly brevet an over here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Christian Scott attuned a adju ah album stretch music this guy has numerous albums under his belt at this point and he's performed and collaborated in the past with such greats as Marcus Miller Grace Kelly Thom Yorke even the Afrocentric hip-hop outfit ex clan and I came on to this album via a recommendation from someone I was having a face-to-face conversation with which is one of my favorite things about just kind of sharing in the musical experience just kind of turning one another onto records that stand out to you significant to you and just move you emotionally that's essentially the reason I started this channel but all joking aside sharing in the musical experience like this telling your friends about music that you think is fantastic that you think is is stand out that's an essential piece of music culture it brightens lives it changes minds and it puts certain artists on the map and in a way on this LP Christian Scott is doing the same as the title tells us that on this record he is introducing to us Elena Pender Hughes and up-and-coming flautist who actually lays down some really great solos on some pretty key points on this record as does Scott on this album with some pretty sassy post bop improvisation x' as well as songs that are more low-key explorative set against some really icy ethereal keyboards this record is a little all over the place there's no real stylistic jazz boundaries that define the entire record a lot like that Kumasi Washington album I reviewed earlier this year Scott and his band just seemed very well-versed in numerous styles of jazz and see no reason not to try a little bit of everything from Latin jazz to very funky jazz fusion and no matter what direction Scott and his band move in they always pull out some very sharp slick and musically vivid ideas I really enjoy this entire records emotional and and sonic spectrum from the very slow and very silky and dramatic atmospheres that guys like Miles Davis used to explore so well like songs such as tantric which is incredibly sexy sensual the glossy lead keyboard melodies on this thing sound fantastic very slowly dancing trumpet solo specific sound gorgeous and their kind of visa sputtering hi hats that are peppered throughout a lot of the track and then there's hard-hitting cuts on here like west of the West which is just painfully funky not only because of its fantastic drumming but its groove enhancing bass there's a bit of Latin flavor on the song twin which has a super spicy bassline and these two trumpets soloing in such close harmony throughout the entire track it's really kind of the selling point of the track obviously what the song is titled after and it's just so ear grabbing and unbelievably tight and just wonderful it's just good to hear some very well performed energetic electrifying jazz music on the song liberation over gangsterism miss Pinder hughes comes through with her flute and she really steals the show with her playing being so elegant at the beginning of the track and it eventually evolves into what sounds like just tweeting fluttering birds and bird calls although I will say the instrumentation the groove kind of stagnates in the last third of this track though I think some of the hi-hat and propositions are cool I will take a moment to specifically focus on the drumming here because the percussion on this thing is amazing especially during the very groove heavy interludes and detours on this thing like running in sevens and the percussion is even great on the softer tracks where the drums take just a subtler approach like on the intro track where we're getting these dizzying paradiddles and it's very clear by the end of the record that at least a chunk of the percussion on this record is electronic is synthetic and it adds more than it takes away from the mix it definitely gives this thing a bit of an electronic new jazz flavor sometimes even the closing track features kind of these fractured piano phrases over a B that sounds like it's coming straight out of the the hip-hop playbook so this is a pretty diverse record I wish some of these interludes I wish some of these detours were a little more fleshed out and just developed into full-length songs because it seems like it was least a little bit of potential here that was not totally capitalized on and with this album being as short as it is it's kind of hard to to see such a diverse set of songs pulled together in some kind of way especially since some of them are kind of short it does contribute to the handful of tracks here feeling like a bit of a mixed bag still though it is very well played well produced colorful vivid and diverse jazz album with some standout solos as well I definitely recommend that you check it out I'm feeling a strong 7 - a light 8 on this thing transition have you given this album I'll listen did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Christian Scott stretch music smash that like have a good day eat your fruits and vegetables get a good night's sleep stay hydrated forever 
Djrg-_jfGis,daddy is a hero that haplin's dad a zero can caddy is a hero that applets that a zero can cut you'll fill out a change.org petition you hi everyone Tiffany Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new beach slang album let's let's get this right the things we do to find people who feel like us these guys are a Philly rock band recent poly vinyl records signees this is you know their first big commercial coming-out party they teased up to the release of this album with a few pretty good singles and they saw fit to give this album the garish title of the the things we do to find people who who feel like us that's the title and not a single song about OkCupid or Craigslist hookups okay hold on I think I got it beach slang what they're doing here is the action stated in the title in order to find people who feel like they do they're coming out with an alternative rock record that's gutsy but gauzy and as a strong pop sensibility and really impassioned lead vocals they then lace these songs with rich heavy harmonious guitars really thick production a little shoegaze e and then they record that music get signed to a label so that they can then tour the nation know the world in order to meet people who feel the same way that they do about these alternative forms of rock music from the 90s kind of elaborate guys not really necessary but at least the end result of the band's efforts is a decent rock record it's not the most distinct sound on the block and there are times when I wish the vocals were a little less garbled but this is an incredibly sharp debut album all the same this thing is no BS there's 10 or so tracks here and only one song on the album sneaks past the 3-minute mark and even though all the tracks on this thing are relatively short the songs are succinctly written they have very defined verses and choruses very sharp endings and the hooks are very explosive and melodic even if they are a little simple sometimes the performances are electrifying their visceral there's definitely a punk energy to a lot of these tracks and the emotional palette of this thing is is a good mix of a little bit of angst but also some feel-good vibes as well the opening track here actually kicks this album off on a positive note with these really righteous the lyrics talking about how the streets ain't got no guts or at least that's what I'm hearing these song ride the wild breeze is one of the more aggressive tracks here a real barnburner that has a gnarly guitar riff with tears welled up in its eyes cuz so just determined the vocals are a little tortured kind of raspy you remind me a bit of Nirvana or like bush there's definitely a little bit of Japan droids mixed in there too somewhere the chorus on this thing brightens up sounds really heavenly the song young and alive is similarly throttling the acoustic number too late to die young isn't that bad either it's cool to hear the band try something a little more stripped back and it goes over very well and outside of these more aggressive cuts outside of these softer cuts many of the other songs here are very mid pace they're not really aggressive but they had this overwhelming bliss that I loved like with the song bad art in weirdo ideas a track that I like a lot despite the kind of cliched twangy lead Beach style guitar in the mix hanging around typically I avoid anything that's indie rock and named after the beach but this is definitely a pleasing exception then we have songs like noisy Heaven and I break guitars which pack tons of indie rock euphoria into these little two-minute sized bits the LP doesn't overstay its welcome it's like 27 minutes long although around the halfway point the band I think has explored their very simple formula as well as I think they were going to they've kind of showed their whole deck of cards overall I thought this is a good LP it's it's a little OneNote but the songs that do very much of the time are pretty great and even though the thing is short this band makes every minute of the 27 minutes in this runtime count again I stress that these songs are tightly just tightly written not a single note out of place I love the production I think the performances are good again I wish the vocals were a little bit more distinct but I do like that rasp they bring to the table and the performances are again electrifying have a lot of energy not a whole lot of complaints about this thing didn't blow me away but it's a really good rock record I don't really hesitate to recommend I'm feeling a strong sentiment of an on this thing transition have you given this album a listen and if you have or do you think of it they love it they hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music rock beats lying forever 
1_TJwc1nFyo,my my rap game black ma ma what you think I rap for hey everybody women rap pant right here the Internet's busiest music nerd messing up his camera messed up his camera mojo and it's time for a review of the new wiki mixtape little me wiki is a New York rapper known for his participation in the East Coast experimental hip-hop outfit racking I was kind of indifferent to their debut commercial EP but then that potential I saw there though was capitalized on with their full-length debut records so it goes an album that I thought brought a refreshing futuristic approach to just the grimy urban jungle of New York hip hop but then the group came through with the 700 fill like BitTorrent curated record that I thought was just really underwhelming and didn't really sound all that well put together or even finished just really cluttered and unorganized and I'm not really sure what the group was doing with this release and I'm even more perplexed by the sudden solo move by group member wiki as he has dropped a new mixtape here with over an hour of material which is topped off with 47 minutes of spiritual guidance from clothing designer Aaron boned her off right at the very end of the record and he actually makes some pretty interesting points about fashion competition art race his build and destroy ethos at one point during the conversation is really interesting it seems like he really could have gone on forever saying a lot of stuff that he said and wiki's music on this project is very similar in tone and philosophies pretty forgiving that comparison even though we do have an hour of music on this project it's not an incredibly well groomed hour of music which in a way is okay because it captures the chaos of wikiz mind and the city in which he lives but I'm sure you will find some comfort in knowing that the same level of rap expertise that wiki has on previous Rat King releases is also shown on this new project over here not only that but a lot of the instrumentals on this thing sound like they could have fit snugly into the next Rat King album so we're not talking about a huge change of pace or style on this thing there are even appearances from hack and sporting life to on this thing so the gang's all here in their best moments the tracks on this LP are pointed they're topical and they focus on a single subject matter like living with my mom's which is hilarious topic for a rap song and actually pretty clever and kind of confessional for Wicky - it's interesting to see him taking something that's just so average and just something that is so outside of the scope of most rap music and just take a humorous approach to it there's the song club shit which gives us this banger beat and lyrically a bunch of late night club debauchery the song three stories gives us kind of a bunch of urban apartment building tales the song hit the L is a really rowdy smoked anthem that sounds incredibly Rat King ish I don't need much is a rapper rapping about I guess living simply another unique sort of lyrical approach or topic on this project and the other highlights on this project they might not be as lyrically focused but they might bring a really fantastic overwhelming dense kind of psychedelic beat or even a hook or some kind of flow that's incredibly catchy like god bless me which features skepta it's really cool to kind of see an East Coast hip-hop artist creating this bridge between American hip hop artists and hip hop artists from the UK there's even the song of Sunday school dropout which has a killer instrumental from Harry fraud so those are the highlights on this thing of course with so much material on this project and it is a mixtape some tracks are just not going to hit that hard but at their worst the songs on this thing are just like directionless stone-faced navel-gazing really underwhelming cuts that don't really add up too much they just kind of sound like wiki is is spinning his heart out but it's not really organized and anything that's all that memorable kind of like on the song motherfucker or cherry tree featuring Mika Chu her moaning chorus on this thing is is one of the toughest moments to sit through and the title track here feels more like an extended interlude than it does an actual song though in a way when I look at the lyrics I kind of get why this project was titled after this track it's one of the more personal songs in the track listing here and wiki is essentially revealing himself or painting himself is just kind of this regular guy who has nothing to hide and he's just him there's no pretense there no airs that he's putting on he's not trying to convince you that he's cool with this lavish lifestyle or anything like that he's just your average scummy dude who just wants to make art and live for today which is a cool message but only if it were organized into a compelling song or something like that I think wiki has a lot of great ideas on this tape and it certainly seems like he struck way more gold on this than he did with rat king on 700 fill but this project is similarly loose and unfinished and rough at some points wiki is undeniably talented but sometimes his lack of ambition gets the better of them on at least a handful of these tracks enough songs to kind of weigh this project down at least a little I'm feeling a light 7 on this thing transition have you given this mixtape a listen and if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana wiki forever 
aPS63VGQ8Bk,hi everyone brushed in 1810 Oh year the Internet's busiest music nerd it's been a while since I hit you with one of those and it's time for review of the new Archie Marshall album a new place to drown Archie Marshall a ka zu kid aka King cruel is a uk-based singer songwriter guitarist dabbles and some rap music as well and this is his latest full-length album under his own name he made a huge splash a few years ago with his debut full-length LP under the king cruel name six feet beneath the moon it was a twang II emotionally stirring set of indie pop and rock songs with a pretty unique voice at the forefront hmm I just love the way his voice just kind of bellows and howls and and all that but now with this new project over here we're getting a change of musical pace a change of name as well this thing is also from what I understand a collaborative effort with his brother and stylistically this thing goes down more of a hip hop influenced Road now I'm not saying that Archie's on this record speedily spitting dense wordy versus just one after another it's not like that we're essentially getting on this thing a bunch of syrupy dreamy kind of blissful and slow-mo beats with Archie's apathetic and slack-jawed moaning on top of it just kind of piercing that ethereal atmosphere surrounding the tones and the very warm bass and I like the general atmosphere of this thing it certainly creates a mood and that's cool and from what I understand it's a bit of a multimedia project so maybe taking this record just as simply a music album isn't entirely appreciating the artistic experience that Archie and his brother trying to deliver here but just speaking from a musical standpoint just speaking from the standpoint of someone who is observing the record and the record only this thing is kind of a snooze fest Archie and his brother here just kind of orchestrate a little bit of sad background music for perusing tumblr on weekend when you really should be out with your friends instead and here and there these guys do manage to create some pretty intoxicating moments but they always after a while disappear into the ether and just sort of vanish before my ears these tracks don't really inspire me to do anything other than just have my mind wander on to other things and with song titles on this thing like empty vessels sex with nobody dull boys and eyes drift it's like the album is trying to write the review for me I appreciate some of the dub like effects that these tracks are awash in and again I think the atmosphere is is generally cool some of the jazzy chords worked into these songs are nice as well and I appreciate that stylistically this set of songs is a really interesting cross-section of a bit of R&B some hip hop some neo soul as well as various shades of underground styles of electronic music out of the UK a bit of dubstep for example like burial influenced dubstep but beyond that the tracks on this thing are pretty vapid and kind of trivial the best thing that some of these tracks deliver is a couple loops the sound okay getting repeated for the first minute or so that these songs last I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing transition have you given this album oh listen and if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it mr. Archie Marshall a new place to drown forever

everyone you have any Fantana here you know who it is this is the latest episode of the noodle drop podcast where we do a series of interviews with musicians youtubers content creators of all sizes shapes and types and in this episode we have a special interview with the one the only producer rapper songwriter hip-hop mystic mr. bus driver how you doing dude I'm pretty good how are you Anthony I'm good you and I talked in email a little bit before we hopped on skype here and we sort of I don't know threw together some some ideas some topics of discussion that we could get into because as much as I love your music and and of course you know that's going to be a topic of discussion that I'm sure we're going to approach at some point in the conversation it seems like at least in my opinion or at least from what I can see there are so many other things that you could speak to given just how long you've been involved in in the music scene you know yeah it's surprising you don't think about tenure or time in a certain way in this type of music but but yeah I've I've witnessed a few things I don't know if that makes me an authority but there's something there well I think you can most definitely speak to this transition that we've seen in terms of the sound and also the industry of hip-hop from the 2000s to today I mean you've you've crossed over that threshold effectively and you've seen success on both sides of that fence and to me it seems like we're dealing with an entirely different animal than we were ten years ago now to me it seems like to you it's it seems like observing you and observing your music you're still kind of in your own little corner you're being true to yourself you're doing something out there you're on the fringes but at least to me today it seems like maybe there's a wider audience for what you do then there was ten years ago correct me if I'm wrong it theory I would think that could be it but I really can't it's hard for me to focus on audience in this day and age without without more in it with the anxieties of the of the internet campaigns that that that you know that make that have created this error I will just say that creatively now I do feel like a lot of the things we were doing 10 years 15 years ago are very normal now and so so there's a lot of comfort that I have in making songs now because I can pull literally from styles I was doing I was 14 years old and have them be applicable if I just tweak them a tiny bit but but still I do make music that is still very particular and um I don't know I think that's because I really I really am a romantic and I really I really cradled this localized approach to it cuz I do try to stay very true to just Los Angeles influences and just try to make songs from the home outward but um but I don't know that's a long-winded answer probably keeping that in mind that you're from Los Angeles that you're making music with with that in mind and one of the things that you said that we could speak to was sort of how a city in a locale and sort of your immediate area can sort of help music evolve in some kind of way how do you feel like that applies in an age where it seems like locale sort of matters less and less and less in the Internet age it's not so much where you're from as much as it is sort of who you know online or how much clout I guess you sort of have online it's the fantastic power as a fantastic freeing condition I welcome it and I enjoy it I think itself I think it's allowed people to create worlds within worlds in very ingenious ways so I celebrate that with low overhead you know I mean so maximizing ideas as always takes precedent so that's the shit but of course there's always an origin and a lot of this music especially a lot of music now and a lot of music that really has an impact that has gravity has a place has a history and um you know it's always good to have a balance of both and that's why I feel like I feel very lucky because my city has struck a balance being as that were right cradled in the middle of the tech industry we know that there is a meta you a meta sphere so there's a here but there is an elsewhere you know just on it on a theoretical level so but but it's very scary on a personal level I got to be completely real it's very freeing but it's very terrifying so I welcome it hmm and it's freeing it's I guess it's kind of like like an acrobatic routine but without a net I guess it yeah it just requires powers man it requires knowledge and powers in community now that that sort of lack of a safety net that's the scary side of this process being so freeing now does does the fear come from a lack of predictability is it sort of the volatility of hip-hop and and volatility of of I guess uh you know the Internet in the music industry right now hip-hop is very misunderstood you know I don't even like talking about hip-hop as a whole yeah I mean because people talk about hip-hop with this air of we know what's really wrong with it but let's not address it or we know what's really great about it but we don't want to point it out so I'm just really I feel really I don't why I don't want to address hip-hop is all because I'm inside of it you know I mean it's too large but I will say this there's never been more hip-hop made in the history of desert than right now there's just a lot being made so it has to be something so - something said about it you have to see how that should influence his business models - you know and as a crazy influence on how people even ingest music now so I think that the high adaptability of a rap act does something to the motherfucking world but as far as like do people enjoy the music that really depends on our internet savvy you are it really does and that adaptability is that something that you know you feel like is is difficult to keep up with because I I don't know it's it seems at this point in your career you know you've been at it for so long that I think a lot of people would presume that you'd be sort of you know kind of stuck in your ways at this point but instead you continue to just kind of charge on and just like really challengers yeah it's I don't know to say about my career but I will say that never felt I never felt that the blow diems or the good lifers had static sounds or had period specific sounds I always thought at the point of what we were doing is that we were tapping into old jazz man impetus and discipline and applying that to our now yeah I mean so in that it's supposed to be timeless and people are supposed to reference jazz because it's our fuckin root you know what I mean and I've been doing jazz music and rap since I was a child and you know it's it's it's my foundation given that that genre continues to be such a huge influence on you even given your I guess even even with your latest records you know how does it feel to kind of see that coming back in terms of relevance because it seemed like for a time especially especially in the 2000s with a lot of the very I don't know tight very synthetic productions of guys like Swizz Beatz and and stuff like that it wasn't really kind of a I don't know at the forefront of the sound of hip-hop especially a lot of the club centric music but nowadays you know you've got it you've got records out there like to pimp a butterfly which kind of put jazz right at the the focal point of the album you know it's it sometimes even takes more of a precedent than just the hip-hop element of the record sometimes it's very interesting man imagine it I never could have I didn't really see it coming but then I don't think didn't mean I did see it coming I mean my my buddy la cool from hip hop client he and he named his group hip hop clan 2000 because he said every nigga in the year 2000 gonna be rapping like this and it turned out to be the absolute truth so I did believe that and it's how it's why I keep styling but but it's uh I didn't know it's but what I like is how beautiful love these records are you know a lot of these records were really gorgeous man so I'm I'm all about it I'm all about it I don't really uh you know I don't really uh I don't really discourage any of it man I just it's all it's all just happening and taking place but I will I will definitely say that when I was making my jazz rap records during the arts early aughts it was there was definitely a particular isolation that's a very particular isolation that I felt I mean but um I think the isolation that the kind of jazz music I was making in the arts kind of produced his headspace that I've kept up until now and I don't know if it's good or healthy but it's there you know what you're saying about jazz music how it sort of inspires you how to put you in this kind of isolated place and how it's kind of coming back in terms of relevance in hip-hop records anyway like to pimp a butterfly simultaneously it makes me kind of think and reflect on just the state of jazz music right now I mean I have people who watch the show who message me that it asked me whether or not I think jazz music is still alive and well is it dead is it relevant is it anything and while yeah sure it's thriving on some of these hip-hop records it would seem that there aren't quite as many new fresh young just straight jazz artists who are making quite as much noise as a Kendrick Lamar or even a bus driver on some levels and somebody who made one of my favorite jazz records of the year Kumasi Washington he didn't even end up getting a grammy nod this year even the the new christian scott record which i think was pretty great yeah yeah i was just talking about that come on scene on getting that well you know the grammar is a very political that has to deal that has to deal with power structures sure but roots music is hard to come by because no one wants to know about folk culture at America no must about true indigenous American musics or life that's not really what we're about we're very a historical people we recreate the world as we see fit that's our that's our mandate so it doesn't surprise me that really cradled in people's bosoms as it should be you know I mean people thought that Nina Simone documentary that came out recently were awestruck you know but most of us who grew up with our parents or at least our parents telling us about her idolized in her us idolizing Nina you know it was just it was a refreshing reflection that we can talk about for you know years to UM come but but yeah all those people are really important man and it you know especially when you see how their influence reverberates in popular culture figures yeah I agree with what you're saying in terms of it okay so we're kind of we're kind of oh no no okay so you're making this point that we're in a Historical Society you know I mean please oh yeah of course of course death not to break your balls but at least pretend like you know what you're saying just for the sake of argument you know you're making this point that that we live in a society that is a historical you know doesn't like to embrace the truth of its past but but simultaneously when I talk to people who are our music fans or consider themselves to be fans of music the idea of not appreciating jazz sort of seems like you're you're admitting that I don't know you're you're stupid or you're intellectually lazy or something so all around the round table of music fans people will sort of tout the idea that they're really huge jazz fans when you know but but sort of like to to point out a line from that new Kendrick record where people sort of say that uh you know I miss when hip-hop was about rapping well you know if you did then killer Mike would be platinum you know it seems to me if all these people who were such huge jazz fans really love jazz as much as they said they did then the genre would be so much relative man it's just it's not really a part of our lexicon when we have made heroes Americans take for granted Americans are so individualistic we always we always pride ourselves and how how much on our own we are but there's a there's a hive mind culture that comes with our consumer mandate and we we don't really fuck with jazz because we don't have our rock and roll mythologies and I've formed around the Jazz man even though it is even though the original music badass is the jazz man you know that's that's where the hipster comes from the hipster comes from you know white intellectuals in New York getting high and going Harlem and you know and inside a you know quote unquote real jazz niggas and kind of interpreting you know and mostly misunderstanding you know this very vigorous kind of art I was very intellectually engaging and that they they can their despair too you know what I mean and that just the whole hipster ism is built off that off that relationship and Anja's and rock and roll is like how that's how we use rock and roll to create our mythology for our stars you know like just just reckless and just gone for it and like we don't see that with jazz now but it's like that's where that shit comes from so it's like I don't know man I don't know I don't know it doesn't surprise me to win got our stars in jazz but that's where all my stars are it seems like kind of an evolution of a cult of personality I mean yeah I agree with what you're saying about jazz kind of having the hold of the root of that but then rock and roll sort of took that cult of personality thing further idea that the star of the show and the centerpiece is like the coolest person you can imagine and now it seems hip-hop has taken that Sam torch and has kind of carry it carried it the several steps further yeah it did it did take it it did take it further but um you know it's it cannot be said that jazz or jazz what people call jazz roots because very political music you know in our tastes aren't always guided by what's best for us but anyway this is good to him and it's always good to hear I'm about to play about to rehearse for some very competent players and it's it's always good to hear people play well it's very it's a different headspace well I mean I don't think what you were saying was very much a diversion I mean it actually kind of brings me into my next point about roots music kind of being political because you wanted to make mention of I guess protest music today why now and and all you know you're talking about how or you just were talking about how our interests aren't always in I guess our best interest you know do you feel like political music protest music is in our best interest and are you kind of surprised with the the general lack of it right now considering everything that's going on with black lives matter and a host of other sort of I guess grassroots social movements Anthony that is a very good question why eyes are not more quote-unquote protest music well how does everyone feel about it you know how do these issues settle into the general consciousness you know and why I don't think they had settled it's very volatile I don't think anybody's agree in agreement on how any of these issues are working on solutions to any of them are so finding a single song and to kind of define in an anthemic like way how everyone's feeling it on a given I don't think is uh well it is very probable people sing all right at rallies but I will say this that people give the civil rights movement far too much they contextualize it improperly completely as always you know we only think that we always look at the civil rights victories like you know voting rights and and and and and you know the rolling back of Jim Crow and all these amazing things and how but we don't really consider the pushback that came about in diem seventies and and and it's it's really hard to like stress with people how fundamentally against this notion of like equality are systemic puppeteers are you know it's just like they ain't fucking with it you know it's like okay black lives matter okay coo coo coo shut the fuck up you know what I mean there's definitely a threshold where people don't care about black issues so it's really grave that people express something because it's really important you know I mean like me me listening to Donald Trump who conjure up this very old fervor is very old Amer American fervor to you know make these you know to create this divisive populist argument so you can get into arc and into office that's very real that's not like some that's not happening in some like liberal hotbed that's that's that's you know there's a lot of Mena a working-class people and downtrodden people who feel who share his views and you know that's not because oh they're stupid notice that cuz they're stupid that's because they've always been here you know to mean in like and that's the thing about music is like I don't like I don't like people to put too many issues in music cuz it makes it like entertainment its fodder for entertainment like Oh black people are being shut oh well it's fine talk about in the song no motherfucker niggas is dead turn to me aim like people actually died I think you're like but I thought it was no no it's not fucking games you know someone's gone and like there's no explenation so it's it's a really interesting tightrope because I don't like people to talk about it too much contextualize it in a fun way but then again it's like it's always been here it's a part of our music anyway so you have to talk about it so it's it's really interesting Anthony I don't I don't think we're gonna get more protest music now because because the powers the agendas to subdue that are too strong it's like it's people again but you know there's so much evidence that it's like hard did not I don't know I don't know what's gonna happen I don't know what happened but but I will say it is that modern systemic racism is far more intricate and thought-out then old-world old-world race systems you know and this so it's like people should be interested in it just because it's fascinating away from it and tell people it's how power works let's not shy away from it this is how power works you create these divisive social stratas you go for it make the power work and you know I got the bottom tier and you create systems that that that suppress them the key that you can use to empower the upper echelon and that's what you do that's how you build Empire yeah anyway I want split to see too much of end song but um well anyway I'm gonna go back to the drum machine all right well you're reminding me of two things while you're hitting on the drum machine one is sort of making music that talks about political things and real tragedies is that something that you can't fully get on board with as far as the hip-hop genre or are this kind of like a difficult thing for you to stomach with music in general because I mean let's let's take a song for example a strange fruit you know I mean very political song very dark song very in this year right now I'm not talking so so now so now if you're making political music it's kind of hard not to make it without it also simultaneously being entertainment I'm just saying that there are people who make amazing political songs now and they're just empowering and therefore the movement of for consciousness and that's that's how music has always operated so that's fantastic there's other music that panders to talking points to try to you know gloss over some details all I'm saying is that making music now is not like making music in the 60s that's all I'm saying and you know and all I'm saying is that these problems are very real like people's lives like and you know we use music to to to beautify our idea of ourselves you know people have a very specific idea of black people because of because of our amazing black celebrity class we have the best famous black people ever they're just ingenious you know so how can we not assign them to being the cast of characters within black life but they are they don't represent black life they really don't and the people who really do represent black life those archetypes are other type of people you know what I mean and so so it's good that we get songs that express that you know I mean and you know me I'm not a source of that I do my own thing because I'm a point of view just like anybody else but I just say that because when you talk about jazz roots music and you talk about you know that's just it's it's his hand in hand you can't you know anyway but um but I don't really uh out a really now man I don't really know I don't really know what the what uh I don't know what entertainments role is right now because there's so much control and entertainment I'm just skeptical well to me it's it seems like so many of these issues are so layered and they're so nuanced and they're so difficult that it's kind of hard to just compact them into a verse or even compact them into an hour-long album and have it be something compelling that everybody can kind of get on board with yeah it's just you know I just I guess when I'm calling for is the higher higher where but you know there is some great that there's some great songs um but you know it's all man art is great I salute I salute the arts good job everybody well my other question is I think a lot of people automatically perceive a lot of what's going on in terms of mainstream hip-hop like a lot of this newer trap music to be really mindless and kind of a political but while I don't think any of these artists might be making an overtly political statement I don't know if you could totally say that to be the truth I mean I think a lot of the racism that we're dealing with today stems and things like the drug war which gives police free rein to kind of very aggressively police urban and black neighborhoods and I feel like a lot of these rappers who are rapping about dealing drugs rapping about sort of this lifestyle are kind of depicting a way of life that a lot of people are leading because of the culture that our drug war is created well you know you know they may not exactly be drawing all those connections but I mean I think it's kind of a I don't know a reality for some people that isn't going to go away until the deal with these problems well it's good to have good quality music so that there's a good threshold for that narrative because you're right that is a very real thing happening the prohibited economies and who participates in them but you know they're very those are also stereotypes you know not everybody in blood life results the criminal activity you know and criminal activities shouldn't be a precondition for a toe type of music I think that's ridiculous you know and that's that's always been my presence even in my own crews as has been to be so vanilla and in touch with white knowledge but still just like niggas enough to kick it and just I don't know that's always been a place with me because I don't really think we need to be one type of way but that being said you know it's hard to get narratives across you know I mean and narratives music right now is all about narratives it's not really about music it's about it's about a personality it's about star quality you know and it's hard to make smart as me in rap a star quality because a lot of words in the shit but really my I don't really have I'm not trying to I mean I want everyone to do well I don't want the ideas to go further but I have I've kind of a weird career that doesn't really just it's it's something else rather than being the springboard to a to a coca-cola ad well I it's definitely something else but I think you defined at least a good chunk of it right there by saying you know that there is a quality of what you just kind of referred to as white the knowledge there while also you know having a strong black message to it I I'm not exactly sure what the question is but I find it very interesting that you kind of ride those cultural racial lines in a society where it seems like people on both sides of that fence identify very close with their race identified very close with their culture and rarely if ever stepped outside of it to learn something new or challenge their own preconceptions that's very important to my music to my humor I mean I get a lot of friends friends not friends I get people fans I first of all I don't it's hard for me to fathom that I have fans of people who listen still so it's always a trip but sometimes fans ask me like why do you use the n-word and all this stuff but then other fans ask me like why do you say so many where is this shit why don't you you know say some shit it's more you know a little simpler more truth more more Street and it's like I just do what comes naturally which is kind of a mistake but it does present itself as it does and I've always always have my I always feel certain ways about it but you know I have people like Rory like mild but what kind of encouraged me give me you put it in context for me at times but um but yeah it's it's very scary but it's also very self-indulgent um yeah I don't know I don't know we I live at a very layered cultural Nexus so and and I can't imagine I'd be sad if I didn't and and when you say it's a mistake you just mean in terms of marketability right well yeah cuz I don't I don't there's not I mean even though now that it really wasn't for a long time and it's like what kind of brother are you would say like you so for knowing you likes it like this but you hang out with niggas and I said who are you you mean and and you know I don't know that's that's that's something very real about my own life that I brought too much music you know I mean that's just who I am but but um but yeah being that what am I trying to say being that is very difficult and freeing all at the same time but it's you know it's something to do and but like I said people make that make sense for me sometimes I'm being very vague by the way cuz I'm away from my drum machine I went you to kiss ten but now I'm back in the living room got a drum machine you were just mentioning Rory there who I interviewed a little earlier this year and he hadn't mentioned this in detail at the time but you know he was talking about who he had had had left LA and how he was back in his home state but I guess partially that had to do with the recent I don't know what you would call it the demise of Hellfire Club or is it just something uh where hiatus like or is that uh I don't know we all well I don't know um we all had to leave that umbrella so that's not gonna happen under that umbrella anymore and a lot of that had to do with I guess what Rory Isaac's has explained and um it's so fortunate um we worked hard to make it presentable at a certain point so and I personally had a lot more plans for it that aren't happening but but it's okay I stand by all the work that we did and and how that went down what was his leaving kind of you know key to whether or not the group sort of continued because at least from an outsider perspective it seemed like the formation very much had to do with him sort of how his come up had grabbed the attention of you when open mike eagle and then there were sort of collaborations featuring the three of you and then no-can-do was kind of looped in let me let me let me explain you my career and Hellfire I began I think in at the end of 29 2010 and I saw it as being something amazing and viable something that my young homies were doing know can and mike eagle and everybody so I joined up I became a part of it and we did feel a shebang Greta and Mike did a bunch of things and then we met Rory and I became aware of him and we made a decision in a tour van and we said we should include him in the fold and I was reluctant at the time but soon became very very very very very happy about it and then things transpired from there but um but yeah I've been very I've been very involved in everything to Rory's and talked about it very involved very involved and I have a whole different side to it that I don't really care to disclose it's not really that important I think was important is that everyone makes incredible work and that you're gonna see a lot more in the future and but um but yeah and I also stress that everyone really take care of how they interacts with their creative endeavors you know what I mean like that cohesion that cohesion is really sensitive you know okay really since I'm moving on from there I mean obviously a you know despite everybody kind of separating off to go do their own thing you obviously still you obviously so hold a lot of what Rory is doing in high regard and oh yeah well yeah well just to clarify me Rory Mike yeah ma'am I'm cool I'm cool everyone know everyone does their thing I mean me me roaring Mike her work a lot together still and you know ever mean I'm cool at everybody you know I'm just I'm just things don't work out for some obvious reasons you know I mean it's very textbook for me how it came to a close and to a point where it's almost embarrassing but but it's what it is and it's the truth and it's and it makes sense why it happened that way it makes complete sense to me and um I think what's important is that the music you know we would take note of the music when it happened why it happened don't know what circumstances who came into it what was the womb to won't like there's not enough I mean when I think about it's really amazing that it took place yeah I mean and I really I stand behind it yeah I mean and it's like the shit is too volatile for anything the last how the fucking he thinks hasn't anybody I'm surprised people still put on albums I mean I mean Jesus I mean when people I don't know I think we absorb this stuff from one end but from the other end it's like it's this a lot in flux ya know I mean just getting everybody on the same page I mean what rap crew is lasted forever and it's but it's not what what anything lasted forever and how do things even develop now you know I mean and it's like things develop in a real particular way now so here they had to respect it was going down and everyone's marna shit because I don't know she's super accelerated but that being said man there's a lot of incredible shit in the future so I'm really I'm just happy to be a to get opportunities to get to make some no no with my homies so he's very well let me make that my next question you know considering the volatility considering how quick things are to change and how things are moving and evolving in a very particular way and given that there are records out there that I know that you find to be a really forward thinking like Rory's new record like Kendrick Lamar's new record you know does the future of music hip-hop in particular and a really excite you you know is is there sort of more I guess hope for you in the future than fear I the future of hip-hop unfortunately is in my own personal sphere you know it's it's literally within you know I don't I don't treat it as an abstract it's literally whatever we want to come up with whatever we want to try and then make public and I mean you know because there's a lot of things like well that kind of sounds like I don't know that that kind of sounds like something off of the off that like the intro track to Mos Def's black does this you know well yeah kind of going on about how well you know if we're sick hip hop's gonna be sick if we go here hip hop's gonna be here but not I really mean that I mean that's that's how I feel about it I don't feel like there's an act I don't feel like I feel like a few people are working they they can have enough sway to to be this is a marker you know I mean and I and I think it's important to take that responsibility because you you want to affect hip hop I mean you want to do you want to participate in music in real time because when you do that it's enthralling and you learn about the world and and you make a more complete piece but yeah I feel that way though it's just this happening now and the future is what we decide to make it from the end of this year way here well it's it's sort of it's sort of what we make it but we direct we have no clue direction it's going yeah but it's like I don't really care but it's like it's hard to even I don't know I feel like you asked me that question and I could conceded to it I would it really refer to hip hop in that way you know online more I mean you know it doesn't necessarily need to be hip hop specifically I'm not yeah music in general yeah is the future more exciting than scary for you in terms of the people you know who are releasing music where you sort of see music moving well it it I guess what I wanted to say is that we're gonna make it exciting you don't think it is you know and um and and but but how we make it exciting has to be different from how we have been so so I'm just gonna do what I can to make that make sense but a lot of people must fear really controlling music and making music makes sense in the world so I feel very lucky um I don't feel like I should be making music at this point of my career but yet I get a ham so I feel like there's something special so that it keeps me doing this wacky craft when you're saying that you shouldn't be doing air you saying uh you know you you would have thought maybe five years ago that you would that your career would have been over at this point or is there something else that you'd rather be doing well my career was going in several times but it didn't but I'm just doing this stuff but um I don't know what's going on it's kind of a kind of a wacky cosmic dance and we're gonna see where things go I mean there are a lot of other things that I personally can and am trying to do but hip-hop in in the hole bus driver the driver concept and that whole thing is that's to um there are a few things we can still do it to all right so having a few things to do with it in the future I mean uh you know would you be able to centering on your music now would give us a hint or give us an ideas to you know any sort of directions sonically that you might be trying to take your next song your next project your next record or I know earlier you were kind of alluding to a side project oh yeah endeavours I have under development and I don't know what's gonna be prioritized and I I'm just gonna see what moves everybody and put it forward but um I do have a few different terms from from what things were I guess I should talk about thumbs a little bit thumbs to me was was kind of an extension of perfect hair a little bit and there was an extension and then a launch pad but um but um but yeah there's some other directions so we'll see I don't know there's a lot of I'm playing I'm making music with a lot of players and a lot of really talented people and Bhama so you're talking about bringing sort of live instrumentation into the fold like well the there's there's always live instrumentation in the fold it depends on how its presented in utilizing I guess these players that you're talking about you know have you worked with them before and and and what are they playing what kind of music are they bringing to the table there's a band from Los Angeles that I used to work with the Freestyle fellowship okay called the Underground Railroad and I work with them I'm about to play with them tonight the low in theory in Los Angeles and we're going to just read from the spell book and see what it do and so yeah I do that to kind of it's great it's a real privilege because there the van I grew up idolizing as a teenager and we just I mean as far as nineties acts go I mean that there aren't many hip-hop artists as sort of fused jazz I mean not that I can think of in the way that they did yeah well those are my emojis they brought me into this world of doing things you know yeah countless hours I've wrapped countless hours of my k9 like I can't even tell you how many times I have my mind-blowing and private by that strange man he is a brilliant brilliant one-of-a-kind guy in hip-hop his story not being told is a part of his of the enormity of his story he thought I mean he's really some sick you know easy even Mike 9 da da da West goes to pot you know he's just he's one of them period you know and and everybody knows that he forgets and behind closed doors but he is the true jazz man and that he is obscured beautifully beautifully as such beautifully of such but but that's my that's my was there a point at which he sort of you know might have turned away from the limelight in the way that a guy like easy he didn't you know I at which which I've heard other artists having done Scarface sort of comes to mind you know as an artist to it seemed like he you know had some serious mainstream staying power and potential but instead he kind of opted to you know instead I guess kind of stayed true to his roots and just make music that that now people I mean you know while he's no jay-z people look back on a lot of his records and just see them as classics I don't know had a lot of the fellas have had a lot of specific problems it wasn't really a romantic thing like he wanted it to was just there are a lot of mistakes I mean sure I really think I mean one of the crimes I mean you know we the fellowship story is one of the great crimes of my scene you know I mean like why with an embrace why why why why why you know what I mean so you bring that up like that's like the linchpin you know that's like yeah mistakes Jupiter went to jail there are a lot of you know weird things with the solo deals after their last record with Island and some of the solar deals in work out my kid and I don't know I don't know what happened honestly I don't really have all the details I would like to hear I've I've been I've been thinking about asking Mike and maybe he's interviewing him somewhere but but it's a really fascinating story and and it's uh it was that such an important time that way it really could have changed how it went cause Mike I had the same management as D'Angelo and he was grooming both of them at the same time you know I mean so imagine that you know I mean so the micronized story is tragic and beautiful man but that's my I'm brother and he's still killing it he's still a man think so see him where he what ever he may be all right before I ask you uh you know one of my last questions over here you know is there anything else that you sort of wanted to say in terms of you know your latest mixtape thumbs I mean you know you mentioned that it was kind of a an extension past perfect hair but you know is there anything else you kind of wanted to enlighten people too as far as the material you put on this tape yeah I really just I wanted to wrap a little bit more with that without some filters and just kind of flex it tiny bit more before move on to something else and thumbs at certain times was a Hodge it came together into something there are a lot of songs that had a lot of different life and um all those songs kind of have different stories to them but I don't know it's I really am really like impress what uh the folks that get to work with it so everyone really merked it on that tape and I just yeah it's just really a celebration of us getting down you know that's just kind of like day-to-day you know I want a thumbs to be kind of like this is what we do you know like and that's why I called it a tape cuz it really was kind of that it's just like this is what we do rather than rather than mission statement narrative world crushing campaign style but that's just how I feel about music right now I'm at the drum machine I'm sorry but yes please get thumbs Anthony I'm talking to you Anthony listen I you gave me thought you gave you 70 thumbs I said to you and you know what you just you just reminded me of something tape you just reminded me of something on the tape that I wanted to ask you about one person who is on the tape that has kind of struck me as I guess not surprising at this point because I've seen him on so many projects now but I'm just really in awe of just how he's everywhere everywhere I turn he server seems to be on someone's project but I'm talking about Samuel herring or sort of Hemlock Ernst and you know sort of under his pen name when he's rapping how has he landed on so many projects recently has he just like you know is he spittin freestyles to you guys and just flooring you and you're like I have to get him on this project um that's a friend of ours yeah so I and the thing is he's he's made it onto so many different projects as of late so you know and it seems off of you know of course his rapping talent but it's just interesting to sort of see you know him working with different artists and him actually uh you know there have been videos of him rapping on the Internet but you know prior to to the past few years I haven't known him to sort of you know be rapping on different rap albums or mixtapes and I'm sort of uh you know wondering how how he landed on sort of Europe project he's on Milo's project I think he did something with open mike eagle and I know he's landed on some other records too he um that's a magnetic guy and he um yeah me and him we all bond on some rap shit so he's ended up on songs kind of very organically so it's kind of bizarre it's bizarre right cuz from a certain standpoint but from a certain standpoint I just Sam you know Sam is rapping all the time every time I see him we're constantly in the act of spitting so it's um surprising me it is not more of it out in the world because a lot of it is he's a very rap centered guy so I can't really I can't really answer that but it's it just took place well as far as you know is there any chance of him sort of working on a new solo project or something that'll just kind of be focused on him maybe his own production maybe production from someone else I don't know I don't know what he's doing I'm not really sure but uh I do know that he he does he's a very it's a very hungry guy I mean as you know he yeah he has yes he has a hunger within the rap world so something's gonna happen alright I don't know what but that being said I'm about to get cookie face and I've got the beat machine plane and I just turned it on and that's how I'm feeling live from the Los Angeles is his driver I have not had breakfast yet but at least at least I'm here Anthony thank you so much for for the interview man it was really dope thank you for coming on to talk dude yeah yeah it was tight I don't know if he talked about thumbs enough but honestly when I think about it it's just a it's just a swirl of colors when I think about how we made it and it's I don't know it's all confusing we we actually finished them it was in the summer but we could well we're gonna we're gonna end it on that we're gonna remind everyone to get thumbs we have placed a link down there in the description box where you can buy it you could stream it and listen to it as well as a lot of bus drivers other recent projects I'll also drop a link to his perfect hair record as well which I very much recommend and I want to thank bus driver one more time for coming on talking to me and playing his drum machine 
nuxmYZM4wOA,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantino here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new GE Z album when it's dark out hip-hop has long been a Chandra based heavily on personality character charisma personal stories glitz and glamour as well as hardship but what happens when you have a rapper an emcee who has little to no personality no real distinct in an interesting story you get GE Z you get GE Z's second studio album here essentially we're talking about an artist here who looks more like a gap model more than he does a rap artist and when you actually listen to his verses he sounds a lot like one too as he delivers for one track after another the most bland and unmemorable bars about bands girls being famous which is hard being in a relationship which is hard he's like an agreeable mix of Macklemore Drake and Big Sean hip-hop's most non-essential character actually on the song one of them which features Big Sean on this record gez goes into the track sounding a lot like Big Sean I was actually kind of taken aback when Big Sean actually popped into the track at the very end and I wasn't actually listening to him for the past few minutes on the song order more we actually kind of get this trap influenced little auto-tune ballad we're GE Z is sounding the most faceless I've ever heard him there's absolutely nothing about this track that makes me think that this song came from him I would have never guessed in a million years that I was listening to a gez song it's like music for people who don't like their food spicy you know they can't take that extra bit of seasoning in there you know just order off the kids menu get those french fries get those chicken nuggets there's also the song calm down off this thing which kind of gives a bit of a DJ mustard vibe if it's trendy on this album gez tries to emulate it just like his big emulative brother Big Sean which this album actually kind of reminds me of big shawne's latest record dark sky paradise in that it seems like a lot of trendy sounds but it's trying to be dark it's trying to be dramatic but the lyrical content really isn't there to give the sound any type of weight there's no witty or charming or captivating lines and the moments where GE is trying to go through his hardships on this record they're more complainy than they are compelling it sounds like hip-hop that was purely crafted for a pop listening audience a mainstream audience especially during the moments here where we get hooks from singers that sound like they would fit so much better on like an EDM anthem or something from David Guetta now there are moments on this record that I like but it mostly has to do with the top-notch production which just seems like there was a lot of money shelled out for it so kind of a waste of a bunch of pretty decent instrumentals here and then there are some pretty decent songs on here I'm talking specifically about some of the choruses about some of the melodies worked into these instrumentals I don't know how much input Gez had on any of these moments especially given all the co-writer credits throughout this record but I will say whenever his verses do pop in after a chorus or right before a chorus it's just boring as hell I don't really know if there's too much more to say about this record because gez simply doesn't give me or I think anyone else much to say about his music again it's just trying to be agreeable and simultaneously forgettable as possible I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing Tran have you given this album a listen if you have the did you love it more than me most likely so and let me know why you think it's amazing let me know what you think about it is so great you know convince me please I hope you have a good day and I hope you're healthy doing well Anthony Fantana gez forever

i cosign check out my reviews or check out his latest two projects a special episode of or his dark comedy album now as far as serengeti goes I've never really been a huge fan of his in a solo capacity he has never really been that exciting of a voice to me but I know he's inspired a lot of rappers who I happen to be a fan of and I have enjoyed him in a collaborative capacity before specifically on that sisyphus record which featured him son lux Sufjan Stevens and I do find his Kenny Dennis alter-ego hilarious unlike some alter egos I could name a hater a day makes the doctor okay so this LP could be good this LP could be great but after listening to it I'm not quite sure how to take it it doesn't feel like a fully realized collaborative album as much as it does an impromptu meeting of the minds because it is super rough around the edges a lot of the time and kind of brief right from the start of this thing something seems kind of off with the production the opening track here features some kind of muddy samples and a very crisp clap not much in the way of strong percussion there are some weird buzzing tones that sort of pop into the hook that don't sound that great listening to open mike eagle and serengeti rap over this instrumental is like watching b-boys try to break dance on quicksand though I do appreciate that this song is kind of a weird fusion of grunge and hip-hop that I never would have anticipated the distant chords and sputtering percussion on the song overlay and don't really leave that much of an impression on me on the song pinky the vocals and the instrumentals seem incredibly muddy here and the song wondergirl is so brief it's almost unnecessary the song tar is very grimy it's very hard-hitting but yet it's still a criminally short moment on this album and the song typecast which actually features some great verses from hemlock urns and bus driver is actually one of the longer cuts I don't have too many complaints about this track I will say hemlock urns drop on my favorite verses on the entire project here it's very speedy he sounds like some raspy-voiced obscure 90s hardcore hip-hop rapper who were just only hearing about now so the production isn't really that great and the songwriting sometimes is kind of off or just very brief and not that fleshed out but at least it sounds like open mike eagle and serengeti are really letting loose and having a lot of lyrical fun on this project on numerous tracks here that's the case some moments stick out to me like when i open mike eagle says that he doesn't know any combos he's just mashing buttons or there's one part on this record where it seems like serengeti is telling a story of a girl who he loved and that she ended up draining his bank account there are also moments here where it seems like serengeti has purposely left mistakes and kind of flubs in the record like on his hook on overland which only sort of adds to the very rough and in the moment feel of this project overall open mike eagles verse on this track is very animated he even includes a poop joke a lot of what's on this tape scenes incredibly off-the-cuff which sometimes works in its favor because it's definitely got a very in the moment and fun energy but i think it works against its memorability and i think it works against its ability to I guess impress it's like listening to a live performance where Serengeti an open mike eagle make music while hi and on the fly which makes for being kind of unpredictable a lot of the time I think and it makes for some interesting moments as well sort of like on the song Church where I think open mike eagle brings a really disturbing and sour and unsettling hook and it will be a while before I forget about Serengeti sort of yelling on a track going everybody calls me pinky yeah if I get some this project up it's a strange junk pile of raw emotions it's perplexing its loaf I it's not that well groomed but it's also intriguing and emotionally intense at points I liked it but I think that's mostly because I'm coming from the standpoint of a fan if you're not already invested in what either these guys are doing I'm not really sure this tape is gonna have much in store for you I would recommend some of their solo projects first before you tumble into this I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this thing transition have you given this record a listen if you have tell me in the comments what you thought of it did you love it did you hate it well to rate it what do you think I should review next and don't forget to smash that like I hope you're doing well hope you listen to some good music being healthy getting some sleep forever 
twoje8x5-R4,hi everyone if any Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Coldplay record head full of dreams famed English rock and pop band Coldplay they really need no introduction at this point you should be well aware of them by now they are on their seventh album here they are following up the very skeletal and very moody ghost stories which dropped a few years ago wasn't a huge fan of the record sounded kind of lullaby ish and not in the best of ways but a negative opinion getting thrown the way of a Coldplay album isn't really that unusual because the band's output for the past 10 years has been a little controversial little polarizing from the very synthetic and grand X&Y to the incredibly dense and commercial and glitzy Mylo Xyloto Coldplay hasn't really given us something that fans and critics can uniformly celebrate for a long time but because of the band's high talent level because of their high profile there's always reason to have hope I hope now with this new record over here on the surface head full of dreams it's a more maximal a more dense record it's a more visceral record it's more colourful it's more melodic it's definitely livelier especially since a lot of the tracks here are backed with some pretty nice organic dance grooves or even sequenced beats like in the case of him for the weekend which is Coldplay's attempt at a party song even the very somber piano ballad ever glow has the sequence Basie kick drum going on in the background a very easygoing tempo you also have the very groovy bass line and the layered poly rhythmic percussions section of adventure of a lifetime which seems kind of talking heads or LCD soundsystem inspired percussion is really a focal point of this album and a lot of the time it's employed in a pretty classy way Coldplay could have easily just backed all these songs with a bunch of EDM banger style drops and all that stuff but they didn't do that in instead they delivered some very well-balanced percussion that fit nicely with the shimmering pretty instrumentation and Chris Martin's very boyish vocals there's even like some 808 inspired snares and hi-hats on the song army of one at one point I like the percussion on this record I like a lot of the instrumentals on this record if only the songwriting had as much bite to it though on almost every one of their albums there's at least one song where Coldplay is trying to pull off their best u2 impression and that sort of happens on the intro track they kind of just get it out of the way so the song there isn't really that sticky or memorable also the track adventure of a lifetime after the great groove on the song gets established it's like Chris Martin's vocals just start really inconsequential and don't add that much to the tune the dance beat is there and that really seems to be all the band was focused on I feel the same way about the songbirds except for the chorus there it's actually really beautiful chorus on this track even if the verses are kind of underwhelming on him for the weekend the lyrics here seem oddly hedonistic for Coldplay a little awkward a little out of place and I think the song is too focused on being grand and being layered to actually be this hard-hitting party track that I think they were shooting for but Beyonce actually does some vocal contributions here which go over pretty nicely I have no idea what the band was thinking on the song kaleidoscope it's like this really weird deep-voiced piano interlude that's a little monologue ish sounds like something you might catch on an old Tom Waits record or something like that while the second half of army of one I do enjoy the first half of this track but then there's a bit of a instrumental shift and the final passage of the song kind of sounds like I'm listening to a remixed version of Kendrick Lamar's swimming pools almost every track here I'm not fully onboard with for one reason or another and even the songs on here that I think are some of the better ones here like the song fun which i think is one of the better written tunes here great melodies the song up and up the closer here is incredibly blissful and the song amazing day which is one of the slower tracks here really tuneful really wonderful and pretty I think one of the prettier songs here and actually works on this really great 3/4 time signature it sounds like it could be a go-to for 2016's prom season again I think the aim was bliss but it's kind of a toothless bliss it's not very potent and as far as the music on this record being more lively being more fun I don't really get the idea from this record that Coldplay knows how to have fun it's trying to give this impression of fun and wildness and letting go when in fact it's just too clean and reserved and too perfectly planned out to be that Coldplay wanted to dance here but I think it just kind of ended up drab instead I'm peeling a light a decent 5 on this thing transition have you given this record to listen if you did what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Coldplay forever 
mciOgnITYyA,but dou u by dou u by dou but do but do Boop hi everyone you have any Fan Tan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Erykah Badu album slash mixtape but you can't use my phone R&B and soul artist Erykah Badu has been lurking in the shadows like the elusive artist now she is for a while now though she has been pretty active on Twitter but for the past five years she hasn't really been in a rush to follow up the very beautiful and conceptual new America part 2 but she has been making some musical noise recently it was sort of a song that pulled her out of this studio project hiatus specifically Drake's hotline bling' which I actually think is a fantastic pop rap single one of the better rap singles of the year I love it and when did I learn route I think it's a laid-back and sleek and irresistible catchy little ballad no real complaints about it and it seems that Erykah Badu feel some type of way about this song as well because she remixed it and the remix was okay it didn't really blow me away or anything like that it was a kind of mild rendition and she landed pretty much on the same beat with the sweet little keyboard chord progression and very hypnotic Casio percussion if there was an opportunity missed I think it was that Erica didn't really tell the other side of the story on this track it really just kind of felt more like a just a cover than a remix but I will say the song I'll call you back on this mixtape later on the project does feel like a legit response to Drake's original I'm just saying that the remix was okay but what's interesting is that this remix and this Drake song inspired a whole series of telephone and sort of relationship themed tracks on this mixtape over here and I stress this it is all phone themed we have the song phone down you used to call me I'll call you back dial a freak and more and there's some sonic themes running throughout a lot of these tracks - the production on this thing is skeletal it's slow it's sensual it's synthetic and it syrupy lots of very moody digital atmosphere surround miss Badu's vocals it's a fun idea it's a cool concept but I think it's a sort of lazy haphazard half-hearted execution even Drake who appears on this project as sort of uncredited or under another name he's got I don't know maybe not the best verses on this thing especially during his first appearance I do it but but I bet that music does the mones he sounds like he's got kind of a cold or something he has a much better feature on the phone number and telephone medley deeper into the project which is one of the longer tracks on here and that's another thing some of these tracks on here just painfully short I wish it was just fleshed out a little bit more if Erika was gonna go this deep into a concept I wish the music Feld has fully realized because while I do appreciate the skeletal aesthetic of the instrumentals here they're kind of unimpressive a lot of the time and the songwriting seems kind of lacks here and they're sort of like Erika's doing a little bit of vocal acrobatics off the top of her head which a lot of the time is fine she's a great singer but it doesn't lead to a lot of choruses or lyrics or melodies that really stick with me and haunt me after I'm done listening to this project regardless though there are some highlights in the track listing here there's the song phone down which is incredibly slow paced and and very haunting kind of eerie with these little synth melodies and Erykah Badu's vocal delivery here it's very very stone-faced and flat emotionless but in such a way where I'm not really sure whether or not to read her lyrics as as being seductive or kind of like a threat as she's singing that she'll make you put your phone down and the song mr. telephone man is fueled by this kind of rubbery reversed soul sample that sounds kind of vaporwave ish to start but then the song turns very blissful very dreamy as it continues on it's definitely one of the more gorgeous moments on this project the song dial a freak definitely stood out not that I think it's one of the better tracks but it's definitely one of the louder and stranger tracks kind of begins with this weird thing about telephones killing bees which kind of stopped me in my tracks and made me start thinking citation needed but then once the song gets going it's kind of this funky electro rap track that sounds like it's straight out of the Planet Rock the clothes are on here features a really impressive feature from Andre 3000 though it's it's not really the climax or I guess the the finisher that I was hoping for a really kind of tile these tracks together this whole thing feels more like a very closely related hodgepodge than it does just a well-groomed concept or story that has a point a and a point B still regardless though I think Erica milked way more gems out of this very strange idea based off of a single Drake song then I would have assumed could even happen and it's definitely worth listening to if you're an Erykah Badu fan of any sort whether you're hardcore or even a casual and I'm feeling a decent of strong sex on this thing transition have you given this album a listen or mixtape did you love it did you hate it why smash that light and I hope you're doing well Anthony Fantana Erykah Badu forever 
eeahM4Fd6WU,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd the Grammys the 58th Grammy Awards have announced its nominees the Grammys if you're not familiar is an American Music Awards show which in one way or another is always a disappointment every year falls short in some kind of way makes an awful pic in one of its most high-profile categories now I have a lot of those categories listed here the artists listed and I'm going to make basically some picks and predictions because hey listen even though the Grammys that they're never really that great and and I never really fully agree with their picks you know still let's let's give them a shot let's learn to live with disappointment alright let's start off with the big hitter here we have the album of the Year category in this category we have some pretty some pretty amazing albums this year we have the new Alabama Shakes record we have the new Kendrick Lamar record we have the new Taylor Swift record we also have the latest record from country singer Chris Stapleton and we also have the new weekened album as well now I predict that the Grammys are probably going to go Taylor Swift they will most likely go Taylor Swift the Grammys they're always about what is poppy what's accessible what has sort of touched the hearts of the largest group of people it's most likely gonna be Taylor Swift I would prefer it to be Kendrick Lamar but I think it's gonna be Taylor Swift and if not her most likely the weakened but I think it's I think it's gonna be Taylor Swift but still I'm pullin pulling for Kenny pullin for Kenny llama and we've also got some pretty interesting submissions for the record or the single of the year as well we have D'Angelo with really love we also have Mark Ronson with uptown funk we've got ed Sheeran with thinking out loud and then after that we have Taylor Swift with blank space and the weekend with can't feel my face I think again in this category I mean I am pulling for D'Angelo I would enjoy Mark Ronson as well but I think it's most likely going to be either Taylor or the weekend I think Taylor Swift is also going to sweep in the song of the Year category though again I would prefer Kendrick as far as Best New Artist go we have a decent handful of new artists here I'm not a huge fan of Courtney Barnett but it would be cool to see you know kind of an up-and-coming in the artist from Australia to get the award but I think it's most likely gonna be Meghan Trainor Taylor Swift I think again will most likely sweep in the vocal pop album category though I would like to see Florence in the Machine I did like that new record a lot now the electronic category is interesting I think it's a little bit of a toss-up we have some interesting artists here for album of the year the latest records from Caribou Chemical Brothers disclosure Jamie xx and finally Jack you now Grammys if you guys have any scruples at all you will give it to Jamie xx you'll give it to Jamie xx or you'll give it to the Chemical Brothers okay but I wouldn't be surprised if I saw Jackie walk away with it The Rock Album category is pretty frustrating for me because the pics just don't make any sense we have James Bay Death Cab for Cutie muse Slipknot and highly suspect we have people who either haven't really made that much noise this year or have easily come out with some of the worst and blandest and most uninteresting rock albums this year also no Alabama Shakes why Alabama Shakes they were in the rock song category of the year why aren't they in the rock album category of the year I mean it would be great to see them walk away with album of the year this year but I don't think it's gonna happen honestly instead Alabama Shakes have been thrown into the alternative album category of the year which is another toss-up for me a lot of great artists in this category we have the new Bjork album new Alabama Shakes album new tame impala record currents My Morning Jacket in Wilco this one could go a lot of ways Bjork has never won a Grammy which is a travesty so it could go to Bjork because she's got that weight she's got that influence she's got that track record but I wouldn't be surprised if I saw it go to My Morning Jacket or Wilco because you know this just kind of modern bulky rocky just kind of middle-class sort of stuff but but I wouldn't dislike seeing it go to tame impala that would be great and it would be great to see you go to Alabama Shakes too so again they're kind of a toss-up the R&B feel with the urban contemporary album of the year is also kind of a little frustrating the internet record is on here the new Kalani record is in here Leon La Havas like I said Miguel the weekend I think the weekend might sweep this category as well though it would be awesome to see it go to LeAnn now of course like every year there's a jazz category there's a jazz list here but let me tell you if this is not on your jazz list you don't have a jazz list and finally we have the rap album category of the year of course in this category we have some pretty big records some pretty high-profile and very hyped albums the last j.cole album Kendrick Lamar Nicki Minaj the Drake mixtape album if you're reading this is too late and also dr. Dre's Compton all really huge all really well received for the most part I would love to see a go to Kendrick but I wouldn't be surprised to see if the Grammys actually picked Drake Drake just has more pop appeal he's got more crossover he's got more influence he's got more numbers but if the Grammys really wanted to celebrate a record that is purely a hip hop record and celebrate a record that has some serious lyricism serious concept and serious potential to become a classic then pick this record if you don't want to do that if you want to continue just giving awards and nominations to artists who are way past their prime because you never gave them a nomination or an award 10 or 20 years ago then pick something else but yeah that those are the gist of my Grammy picks and predictions and we're gonna leave it at that let me know what you think down in the comments section who is going to win in these categories you think the Grammys are in a disappoint once again this year just kind of get together some controversy and snub some people who are sort of hoping will win the transition those Grammys coming up thank you for watching don't forget to smash that like subscribe I hope you're doing well and are you gonna be watching these Grammys are you just gonna hang back you know do some Netflix and chill let me know you have any Fantana Grammys forever 
y-BGmO5CeHc,wha-wha wha-wha hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new selfie compilation product idiosyncratic electronic music producer alias for mr. Samuel long Sophie the musical project that helps start this whole hypetrain on the internet for a little music group slash label known as PC music you might have cost Sophie early on with big smash alt electronic music singles like bit and lemonade and these singles took off gained so much attention Sophie's just really strange approach to electronic music and pop gained the attention of people like Madonna and Kyary Pamyu Pamyu as well as Charli XCX and wrapper leaf people who he has worked with not to mention there are numerous underground producers right now sort of emulating his sound now sadly since the release of these singles which were very good we're not getting a record we're kind of getting a compilation here a compilation of all the big singles that sophie has released since smashes like--but and lemonade which altogether only account for eight tracks and 26 minutes but still it's a collection of Sophie tracks and gives me an opportunity to sort of praise what Samuel is doing under this project because I like it a lot Sophie's solo productions I prefer much more than a lot of PC musics general output from AG Cooke and Samuel and whoever else may be involved in the shadows specifically those tracks that landed on the PC music volume one compilation which a lot of them I just thought they were okay sort of sounded like very average chipmunk 2000s era pop music with some gimmicky production although I did like that new Hannah diamond single I played that so many goddamn times so being that this is a singles collection there's no concept or anything no overarching theme bringing all of these tracks together but Samuel does have some really sharp and strange production quirks that run through all these tracks and make them feel very snug tight and closely related such as hard hit beats that are very danceable but much of the extra percussion surrounding these grooves is really strange glitchy it's unpredictable as are the sense some of the time of course there then the very chirpy chipmunk vocals which sometimes appear in in lead vocal performances or maybe some samples that are looped throughout some tracks they all sound like they're coming from either the same or very similar female vocalist with a very posh accent there's a lot of rubbery sub bass thrown into the mix too it's music that's equally informed by 2000s dance pop as well as whacked out trap songs like I don't know tonight's higher ground but there's something significantly weird about what Sophia is doing on these tracks something really postmodern about what's happening in this music but also incredibly poppy like j-pop and kpop poppy very hyper very energetic very melodic on this compilation you're getting club bangers that come with a challenge a bit of a dare sure the grooves might be there but what's happening with the vocals and the sense is so weird it's just kind of like come on you like it I dare you like it and it's not a pretentious challenge it's not music that looks down on people that doesn't get it it's a kind of weirdness that feels really playful and freeing the music here sort of makes me wonder what alien races might think if the earth at one point were to become wiped out and the only trace left from our society was a copy of this record songs like lemonade might lead them to believe we were a very fun group of people which is one of my favorite cuts on the compilation here it is criminally short but still densely packed with all these what about synthesizers and sputtering pieces of percussion just a myriad of different sounds and the only thing really kind of keeping sanity and making this thing seem coherent is a very lazy laid back just stoner eyes lemonade lemonade it's got this really lumbering heavy beat that sometimes breaks into these sugar sweet sour patch kids choruses with these chipmunk vocal I hit that busy feeling and I went on my mind I love it it's great I'm just just crazy for it and then with songs like hard as well as we get the album's hardest and most awkward and most challenging bangers and it's not like just some straightforward hard-hitting dance song it's like if bangers gain the technology for interdimensional travel this hard track against this really I don't know rotund bassline it also features these sparkling synthesizers that sound like something out of I don't know My Little Pony while the other track here is kind of techno flavored and just features very hard punchy percussion in these really sharp sense stabs the song L or le kind of has a bit of a Death Grips influence definitely something from their first two records with a huge large shot of bass kind of reminds me of tracks like tachyon honestly but with some weird sour synth notes and some other miscellaneous sounds and effects and weird squawking noises filling up the the tons of space left by the huge rushes of bass and the songs bit and VZ are maybe the most Club appeal that this compilation has to offer despite the amateur vocals on the former and the weird bird squawks on the latter of these two tracks the track love is really unsettling and features a heavy sour squeaky drone and a really stone-faced refrain of just kind of repeating the letters of this word lllll and the closing track it's a pretty a little ballad but it sort of reminds me of a lot of those tracks off that PC music compilation just sort of feels a little too normal and sticks out as a result of that though still I do think there is a good tune at the core of this track this compilation to you me exactly what I wanted from Sophie exactly what I wanted from PC music some forward thinking crazy poppy sweet catchy electronic music that is bending my mind as well as just moving my hips and yeah I just you know have a lot of nice things to say about this I'm just waiting for an album an album would be great because the singles altogether so fantastic I'm feeling a decent of strong eight on this thing transition have you given this compilation a listen if you had what do you think of it the gel out of it yeah why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Anthony Fantana Sophie forever 
CJDcbwpsjU0,hey everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Kid Cudi album speeding bullet to heaven Kid Cudi is a rapper singer composer multi-instrumentalist as well it seems who had a pretty promising start to his music career his professional commercial music career in the previous decade he was delivering some very moody introspective hip-hop that not a lot of other rappers were and while I didn't really go head over heels for his stuff I thought his follow-up to his debut was kind of mediocre I was pretty indifferent to it but at least he wasn't like a generic artist to me he had a sound he had a vibe that I could recognize but pretty immediately after his next album mr. rager himself seemed to fall off and not just quality wise like he fell off the edge of sanity and started to release some of the worst music of this decade the faux rock album he did with that wizard collaborative side project also into cud which is a record that still haunts me to this day to the point where I completely skipped over mr. Scott miss Cuddy's next record satellite flight however his new record over here my morbid curiosity got the best of me because I heard it was a rock record actually the lead singles that were teasing this album songs like confused as well as wedding tux and also judgmental cunt these songs were kind of intriguing to me I guess it was sort of interesting to see Scott going in another direction what Cudi lacks in musical chops a lot of the time he has an attitude and emotion and genres like grunge and alternative rock and punk music emotion and an attitude are the cornerstones of these styles of music so Cudi might pull through on this one no nope no no this is easily the worst record I've had to review this year maybe not the worst album I've heard this year I mean there's certainly worse records but the worst album I've had to review and it's it's very rare that I define albums in those terms but there have been some very special albums this year that came out and I had a very strong distaste for this one - takes the cake the hair cake this thing is almost completely unlistenable the core of the album is 18 tracks long and if that wasn't enough Kid Cudi saw fit to add eight more songs of demos and rehearsal demos which are even more of a wasteland than the core of the record on the last leg of this record Kid Cudi spends this album pretending he's like Kurt Cobain it's like the first part of the album is what he thought was his successful career and then he offs himself and then he spends the rest of the album convincing you that he was so great that you needed to hear these demos when in fact the demos are so awful they're so weak they're so badly performed they're even less listenable than all the songs that preceded them but for the first section of this album there are really two sides to it one side where Kid Cudi is boring you to tears and the other side where he's essentially just annoying you and getting on your nerves so on the boring side of these 18 tracks Kid Cudi essentially recycles and repeats the most rudimentary of guitar riffs and drumbeats and vocal lines to the point where the tracks just get stale within the first 30 seconds Kid Cudi he might deliver some decent sounds and the production on this record overall I think is pretty cool that analog tape definitely brings a nice heaviness and clarity and crispness and punchiness to these guitars and drums but Kid Cudi isn't writing songs so much as he's writing little snippets and slivers of songs and then just stringing them out for 2 to 5 minutes like I'm confused or screwed or Amen the song fairytale remains as well honestly I don't even know why I'm listing tracks out that is basically the musical premise of almost every song here the difference with the tracks that are bearable though is that they are maybe a little more visceral a little more explosive so it kind of makes them just enjoyable in comparison with these incredibly stale annoying songs they're actually some riffs on the songs fade to red or man in the night and still even in the context of this god-awful record I still enjoy judgmental cunt it's probably the most diverse and wild track on the entire record and I actually wish Cuddy took as many risks on the other tracks here as he did on this song because the vocal performances are wild the guitars are heavy the drums are punk as hell but the thing is these halfway decent tracks are nowhere near as plentiful enough or quality enough to raise the standard of this entire album public no problem needless to say the slower songs the more subtle songs the ballads on here are even more painfully boring tracks like wedding tux or the incredibly long song adventures which is not only needlessly long in and of itself but it also features this asinine beavis and butt-head skit at the end of it actually quite a few tracks actually end with a beavis and butthead skin honest-to-god appearance from Mike judge animator writer and voiceover artists pretending to be beavis and butt-head and acting out these really awkward dialogues in relation to this terrible album even beavis and butthead themselves can't seem to get on board with some of these songs as Beavis kind of pops in to say hey hey I don't know Butthead and then the teacher pops in to go oh well okay Kid Cudi's emotional and buhbuh buhbuh buh and I know you guys are on hallucinogenics where I don't know where that came from but if there is kind of a moral in that kids listen drugs do not make you make good music they really don't you need to have kind of a base level of talent or at least cuz I'm kind of like sober great musical idea before you just take tons of drugs and then embark on some kind of musical recording adventure because that this will happen he just seems to travel further and further down this rabbit hole of awfulness and I just kind of wonder how far it can go how many albums until even the most deluded of Kid Cudi fans are gonna say wow he's he's really making bad music this time and there are other lyrical moments on this record that are just so hilariously bad to go back to this adventures track like her vagina is I'll keep you safe just hold my arm and also this one thing I loved no more chicken sandwiches yes I'll pay for the damages hell yes I will say though quite a few of the lyrics on this record are incredibly dark their depressive their suicidal they deal in drug addiction however a lot of the very repetitive and very plain language that Kid Cudi uses on a lot of these tracks I think fails to kind of translate the pain that he's experiencing also the fact that so many of the songs on this record are musically inept it sort of keeps his message from having any impact the music itself is so weak that Cuddy's emotions and Cuddy's messages on these tracks just aren't that well translated not going to get too deep into it but another thing that I have notoriously never enjoyed about Kid Cudi's music once again it's terrible here the vocals the singing on this record is by no measure good singing you cannot argue that the singing on this record is good you cannot you can't you can bleed I'm gonna make an album it's gonna be a rock album ending then to me you know the 18 tracks that Cudi delivers initially on this album are bad enough but then once we get into the demo section of this record it just turns Saul sucking it's like once you've knocked the person out you're just jumping on top of them and holding their arms down and smashing their face in until they're just a bloody pulp of nothing this album is the musical equivalent to just a mile of hot coal walking it is sadistic really what Kid Cudi is doing to his listeners by no standard is this a good or even a punk rock album he's lost his mind he's just off the deep end okay and not even like a you know you know in a way where he's like doing this Captain Beefheart kind of thing where his music is just so whacked out and just so strange nobody can get it it's not like that at all it's like he's at such a high level of delusion that this becomes what you want to release as your album 90 minutes of this if I talk about this thing anymore the migraine that this album the seed of a migraine that this album planted in my head is gonna get worse so for my sake for your sake let's just call it here I'm feeling a zero on this record a big fat goose egg you know there are a few riffs here and there that are somewhat okay but then the ridiculous lyrics and the beavis and butt-head sketches just pull away from anything with this album an in terms of a saving grace including the final moments of the record the old demo section I'm gonna just leave no there's no cow thing going on here okay there's no cow thing going on here this video is over there's no more jokes there's no it's done okay it's over so bye

creators of various sorts and speaking with me in this episode I'm going to be talking with UK producer up-and-comer recent brain feeder records signee igloo ghost he has a new EP out titled Chinese New Year reviewed it not too long ago it's definitely gonna be on my list for my favorite EPS of the year we're gonna be talking about the music on this EP sort of where he sees himself going with his art in the future and just sort of his present-day stuff is as well as I don't know maybe what he's doing on the side as well he was telling me that he was just going to school while simultaneously kind of being this regularly blogged about and talked about music producer how you doing dude yeah that was a really hype intro you just came right in there old-school soda voices you really threw it back on that one in real life I did like the slide and everything oh wow you know my my aunt when my aunt got married and she got married sort of late in life her co-workers is a joke they played that song on on her wedding day on the dance floor and her niece on her husband's side of the family and me seemed to be the only people there who knew the dance so it was just me and her we did the dance we crank that Soulja Boy all the way oh yeah Soulja Boy is like that's like the sound chart from you well I guess you guys call that high school we call that up his career when I started that and I'm sure I don't know what grade this is probably eighth grade or something like fucking soldier what was the soundtrack to like everybody had like these Sony Ericsson phones we like bluetooth in cranked that it was like pasta a Rob it was like honor that one where he told us about like his report cards mmm see it was crazy yeah soldier boy came out when I was in college and and that song was hot that song was playing all the time as well as um do you remember and I brought this song up with other people who are like my age and they don't remember it at all do you remember or have you heard the chicken noodle soup song oh shit chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side chicken noodle soup yeah chicken noodle soup that song was all over the place did you guys have um Bebo in America like I don't I don't remember having Bebo that was like the social network that we had oh okay okay I thought we were still talking about a music thing I remember Bebo vaguely remembers Bebo yeah I think chicken noodle see unlike pin was I thought peanut butter jelly time thing without that was that was one of the earliest internet memes yes it was pretty early internet meme Oh being a black sheep Fox animation stuff like stuff was good and new grounds too oh yeah you no I heard and I don't know if they're sort of doing anything to kind of prevent this a lot of that flash animation is kind of going through a bit of a like a y2k kind of thing you mean like well the thing is I still know it yep I hear because of that stuff and just the updates with flash a lot of that flash that that stuff thrives on is no longer gonna be relevant it's no longer going to function so all of those amazing horrible crude offensive like game-changing flash animations are gonna be completely gone yeah exactly I that's what I'm thinking you know the thing is people complain about this idea that you can't be forgotten on the internet and whatever you do on the Internet is gonna haunt you forever but I mean I think I think I think this coming sort of change with flash and HTML I mean it could it could kind of erase all of this stuff from the internet by just making it completely inaccessible because people won't be able to see it anymore holy shed did you just say 55 yeah fight by group X yeah I think I did dude I bought that I'm pretty sure I bought that CD off the internet yeah though I'm like they come from like a fictional country I think they just were pretending to I think they were just doing accents it was pretty amazing that and the I can't believe we're talking about this right now that and the I'm trying to remember do you remember three brain with that school bus song no okay it was like a really like a really weird song with a squirrel right they they also did that and we song and we that that song was sort of popular yeah you do remember a so yeah yeah if you were if you were in 255 you probably heard and we like that was pretty popular too that's somewhat deep in my subconscious although I know some of that stuff has made its way onto YouTube now so you could definitely search it on YouTube but sort of to see that stuff in its original flash on the original site where it came from I think is a good reminder of just how weird the internet used to be you know as somebody who seems like they've been on the internet for a long time and it seems like you know you you you know a lot of these same weird obscure older memes that I know so you're familiar with a lot of these same portals that I was on but obviously you were younger when you were introduced to a lot of it whereas I still remember a good chunk of my childhood having no computer you know and just no internet at all having said all of that do you feel like the Internet these days is maybe sort of more sanitary than it used to be oh yeah I think it's a bit less Punk like kids like I mean we used to sort of create like I've made about since I've been on the internet just like like when I was a little kid like I made like a Pokemon forum where they there'd be like four usernames and they'd all be my mates but it was more about like carving out your own sort of like weird clubs whereas now maybe it seems like people only hang out and like Twitter and Facebook and things nobody saw carving out their own lines no I could definitely see that I mean I remember a background that same time where I live in Connecticut there were a lot of forums devoted to the local Connecticut music scene and people would regularly post fliers and information about shows and and the funny thing about that was is that people would actually show up to the shit yeah you know as opposed to people putting up like one Facebook update after another or being like hey guys check out my DJ set and like nobody comes because nobody cares but I remember one site that was a pretty popular around the time and you can you know sort of see how dated this was is that there was a site called CT Scot calm so this is obviously during the 2000s when Scot was very popular and in basically all the local groups all the nationally touring groups whenever they would come through town they were updating their and letting you know that's where the Scot bands are playing come here this VFW this this venue we're doing a punk we're doing a local Scott show come on down and people would show up the shit was huge and now it seems like people aren't as sort of weaved into these really underground really intimate groups anymore it's sort of like everybody is tossed into this huge lake where everybody's trying to fight for I guess relevance and retweets and favorites and likes the kind of it does so just like I'm not I have nothing to do with this stuff but like that's like these fondant and things and I'm not even so our people sort of separate there are in little groups I'm one website but it seems to happen like you got a club and stuff um come look no I definitely agree tumblr tumblr is one of my favorite but simultaneously one of my least favorite social media platforms mostly because of what you just said because there are some really great little burrows over there and and one of my favorite things to do on tumblr is I just randomly follow back people who either mention me or I know just follow me and then I just see the really weird videos art and text and a myriad of other things that these people are reblogging but the flip side of tumblr is that when I'm posting on ER when I'm putting things up on it I somehow just piss people off by just existing it's it seems like a lot of people are just very much in their feelings on tumblr and it's just it's kind of you versus Amorites sometimes you know like I like to I like to rattle those cages a little bit occasionally just the idea of me being controversial to me is just really funny because I feel like I'm one of the least controversial people on the planet you know there's no like I don't have any like skeletons in my closet or anything like that and harboring any really dangerous opinions or anything but but I somehow managed to the MOSFET guy I'm just a problematic guy who just isn't as big a fan of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy as some people would like and and that's that's really it it is a big issue it gets it gets brought up a lot but you know I just made a video on my other channel where I was making mention of the fact that when you say something you got to own it you know or I think even if people think you're wrong those who are level-headed the little e stick respect the fact that you're owning what you say when people bring that up I'm like yeah I did give it that score you know I'll often retweet people who make mention of that to me just to be like hey everybody just reminding you that I did this and just just letting you know just seems like it seems like you guys are still hung up on it so I'll just I'll just remind you a little bit that - any fuckin takers on the Internet I'm just I'm down man I'm down for an Internet Rumble so alright let's let's get into this EP that you put out a little earlier this year it was easily some of the just zaniest whacked out shit I've heard all year and I want you to go into a little detail and just kind of enlighten me a bit more as to this really weird world this really weird imaginary world or concept world that that seems like the press release that went out with your music addressed but didn't fully go into I kind of have a feeling that you could sort of write a book on this imaginary world that this really strange worm care character that is supposed to be featured in your music exists in I'm gonna do like a little zine of like a bunch of low Honjo and comic strips to it I kind of wanna I wanna I take you locate like the story a little bit more but there's still something I'm kind of like improvising more than like unfolding gradually but yeah the EP is it kind of it's not a century but if you want it for is the tailored on this this were made of gelatine and um it doesn't really have a gender or because sometimes it's voice by my dad and sometimes this voice by my little sister but the worms it doesn't know why but it's flying through these portals like seemingly infinitely until I do these bizarre world candy like colors and all these just like pink fog everywhere and these mountains I like growing off the floor and stuff and um it constantly house like this sad expression on his face and I mean I'm gonna explain the fate of the of the worm like an album or something but that's kind of what the EP is man I feel like like like the war I'm kind of dodging with these fruit and stuff that's getting like thrown and I don't know just sort of flying about if you got me so through these wormholes with this fruit with these different dimensions in in your mind and your imagination our any traditional rules of physics or science or black holes or anything like that being applied here or is something way more abstract going on no it's just everything can somehow fly about hmm it kind of reminded me of uh I can't name the character off of the top of my head I think I think his name no no I can't remember it reminds me of an adventure time episode sort of when Finn and Jake are kind of like caught in that I don't know that weird space-time dimension that really yes it says the guy whose pink in his 2d is he kind of yes yes yes and he's like kind of he's kind of portrayed as almost like a shadow on the wall that they're talking to like this pink shadow on a yellow wall yeah and he hooked up with something yes yes he does it kind of reminds me of that it just seems like it's coming from this sort of cartoony place but it seems very influenced by real UNMISS understood science yeah it's definitely quite silly hmm okay so so this worm character I mean there aren't like huge verses and like tons of I guess story like lyrics going on in your music so how exactly do you sort of tell this story of the worm do you see yourself using more lyrics in the future or do you see yourself kind of merely telling the story through sound I mean you know why I didn't really want it to be this thing is asunto to enjoy what the music thing or just this optional thing on the side but something something I had fun playing with with I use like I use the same sense in every single song I'm not sure if anybody : to that but it's this on this is quite wobbly pitch if the I don't know it sort of sounds like elastic to me yeah in my head I kind of imagine that to be the worm so that's bending around like these elements and movie strikes yeah I think that's kind of fun to sort of follow about like if you're actually cars are what and and other sounds that you have in the mix on some of these tracks do you have some of these sounds applied to in your head sort of other things that are going on like our some sounds the fruit or some sounds like the wormhole yeah that's like um I got my dad to scream in kitchen and I call him how I did if I made this like weird squeezing sort of poor to sound and that pretty much at the start and maybe end of like basically every track or is somehow like in the middle of the same okay yeah and I imagine not to be like the worm actually going through a pool okay so I mean yeah obviously like you were just saying and and I think um I do want to say the name of that Adventure Time characters prismo so obviously like you were saying it's not anything that you need to read into too deeply to enjoy the music itself but you're seeing these sounds is like physical kind of colorful actual manifestations of of something in your imagination they're not just like simply a sound yeah and and each one is kind of a bit of a character in a way and interacting with the other sounds but but in in some way it all kind of comes together in a in a really musical sense oh yeah okay you like that well then I I guess um I guess my next question is how do you sort of continue that storyline in your mind how do you sort of continue imagining the sounds in this way while simultaneously paying attention to the music of what you're doing because obviously you have to be conscious of the fact that the song is at a tempo of some sort that the that a certain part of the song is in a key here that you're working within a certain chord progression or something you know interesting to start maybe eventually I've got this idea that because I kind of make pictures and stuff so I I want to start doing these animations I don't know if we'll be 3d or 2d or anything of like I guess a continuation of the story but then actually make music after I've got the visuals down so I'm gonna have to Ben do this movie sense and the structure of the song how things move in the animation I think it'd be quite cool I think that's sort of how people score films and stuff that would be quite interesting rather than to do something like BPM and like bars hmm alright so moving away from sort of this concept that you have going on with this EP in your music so far I mean we'll see how that kind of pans out in the future I mean you you are planning on having an album out through brain feeder at some point yeah yeah would that be for next year or um yeah well guys the plumb pulley like some uh okay well then I want to ask you about something specifically about the making of this EP in your music that I found kind of interesting and that's the whole idea that you involve your dad and your your little sister and you kind of pitch shift their voices to appear on the record of when their voices do appear you're sort of imagining them as the same sort of worm character when they do when they when they do have a voice on the on the music yeah somehow and and sort of when you're asking them to participate what how exactly was that conversation go down I mean I mean with your little my dad's bount the clown he just went for it but like oh really Aloha sister I've got I've got bribe Oh with like she's she watches all these youtubers and she's with this product placement like this stuck into her brain and one of these EG busy drinking Monster Energy so like every time I won't have to do a vocal thing after God to Tesco and like get a monster energy note her brain give her that and then like then I'm allowed to record oh it's a hostage that is the exact opposite of what I would have expected okay like I would have expected a little kid to jump at the opportunity to yell be noisy scream be annoying go crazy go bonkers and sort of yeah yeah okay got it she's that she's on the self-conscious vibe right now look she's at the age of understanding that her input that her that they you wanting something from her that has value to it so she's going to she's gonna take advantage of that okay no that's that's that's smart then that's fine he but your dad I think that's really funny that he's just like he's just totally game yeah I mean he's like he's and he dresses up in like women's clothes and wears lipstick on his face and just like screams for hours so I mean he's pretty used to it okay but well obviously you aren't literally composing punk music but I imagine in a way that that punk ethos sort of informs what you're doing in some kind of way yeah hopefully I already like to do what other people are doing is is that sort of what defines that ethos to you kind of going your own path and just not really caring what the majority is preoccupied with yeah cuz it's just pretty much any form of rebelling against them I guess yeah I mean it's it's sort of a people talk to me and ask me about and I agree with you because I see that sentiment in a lot of modern art I see that sentiment in in a lot of people's records but it's not manifested in just simply three chords on a guitar and and someone yelling on a microphone anymore you know so when people ask me like hey aren't there any new Punk records in my head I'm like yeah there are tons of great you know Punk records as far as the ethos goes but you know I I don't think there are any great records out right now that sound exactly like never mind the bollocks if that's what you're asking me I mean I think I think song cloud is Punk like the fact that these little kids are just uploading like ooh these Tunes putting stuff out for free on bond campus who would DIY like they've just nicked like a blue tennis I mean it's made the stuff in the room right that's pretty much pun that's like zine culture that's like pressing records yourself just that's really interesting that is really interesting that you phrase it like that because when I talk to people who are like my age or a little older when when issues and when topics like DIY come up they get super sour over sort of I guess what you would say or the advantages that the current generation has and say they're not DIY they're not really doing a DIY when we were doing a DIY we were printing our own scenes over at the Staples and we were you know printing our own 7-inches and yada yada yada and I mean I don't know while that's the case I mean if you guys had the technology that the current generation has you would have taken advantage of it in the same way like just because it's not particularly hard doesn't that's not taken away from the sentiment yeah I mean it's it's even though there are elements of it that are easier there are other elements of it that are now harder because you've essentially raised the difficulty bar in in a lot of ways because now issues such as you know getting your music out there getting your music recorded are now made easier to everybody so now it's it's it's things like grabbing people's attention which are incredibly hard whereas back in the day I mean if you manage to get through all of these financial hurdles if you had a finished professional sounding product it wouldn't be too difficult to at least turn a few heads and and sort of and once you've turned though head those heads they kind of will stay in your direction and wait for the moment that you do something else whereas nowadays it seems like the real difficulty comes in grabbing attention and then once you've grabbed it actually maintain that attention you know it for a period long enough to the point where when you put out your next album people still care about it yeah I mean I'm not gonna say any names a good friend of mine he's he makes music he I mean his stuff is like still amazing and he just finished this rock of it sounding really good but like the label he was with didn't want to put it out and it just seemed to be more because his name sort of been in the for a bit of a long time but we were saying like if I gave him the records I did they probably put out just because like on my name is just new and so a little bit talked about but it is weird like people sort of seem to have a sell-by date and it it kind of disregards the actual quality of the work ya know it's it's it's true so I I guess going off of that I want to ask if if an artist finds themselves and and not saying that you need to name name names or anything like that like you just said if nervous finds themselves or if you find yourself in that position what what are the options that you have from there are you just you know cold fucking liver or can you put out some music for free and somehow generate interest again it seems to sort of take it into a hip-hop direction for a second it seems like that was kind of the the the issue that waka flocka flame was just having I just reviewed his new mixtape and and part of the reason he came out with that sequel mixtape to flock of Ellie is that his label just refused to release the the sequel to that album was entirely off of flock of Ellie he tried to put out flock of Ellie too so to get a pipe for that because his label refused to just release it he did the 1.5 mixtape to generate some interest because months ago he had complained that his label isn't releasing flock of Ellie - they're saying that they won't release it because I'm not as hot as they want me to be so I think he just put out this mixtape now which i think is good I thought it was a good mixtape to sort of generate interest again so as an artist - who might find themselves in that position where your label is being like oh well you know the thing is not as many people are tweeting about you as we would like I don't exactly know how the conversation goes down what exactly are your avenues and your options to go from there can you simply let like you were just saying if I handed them the record they love it because I'm new I'm this I'm that can you merely just start putting out music under another name and just start anonymously releasing music and generate interest again I think we even had that move is a sin like even a name changements of hope the situation like oh fuck that's crazy now it is crazy you know the Internet has really sort of sped up the demand for a new new new that we have and and it was it was at a point where I felt like it was at maybe a livable medium where if somebody came out with a new record and it was great even if it took them a year or so to come out with another record people would still be anticipating it whereas it seems like these days even if your last record was good if it took you two years to come out with your next one nobody's interested which is kind of nuts it is scary you know simply just not the sort of giving everybody instantaneous gratification for a single moment is enough for them to just stop caring about you I mean University I think the sole reason why I haven't dropped out yet is because I know that because I know that for some reason in this day and age like careers are just more finite than ever like my whole stuff could just fade it into like a relevance in about two years easily sure it's creating you it is and and it's why sometimes when people email me and they ask me uh hey dude I'm about to take all these like music production courses you know so that I can either become a full-time artist or I could become a full-time producer like in a studio or something I mean I severely advise against it unless you're a prodigy or you really know what you're doing or you just are so dead set on it that you can't see yourself doing anything else and when I say anything else I mean not even breathing or sleeping yeah you know I don't mean like you kind of like music producing but also you like you know your really big into like bowling or something they're like I don't know journalism or electrical engineering I mean like you've got to be so devoted to it that it literally consumes your entire life it is you know and and the thing is some of the people who I know who are the most talented or self-taught you know they didn't necessarily go to school for for that sort of thing and and if you take the I and if you have the opportunity to I encourage anyone to before you shell out tens of thousands of dollars to study music production at school see if you can get an internship at a small studio where you can get behind the board and actually see what doing that stuff is like but that's another conversation I guess so moving on from sort of your album in the future and I guess just kind of how finite music careers are I imagine that in your head you're still pretty set and you're still pretty I guess a positive about the future of what you're gonna be doing with this next album yeah I guess one of the main things I always want to do is like like I wouldn't put out music if I feel like it's already been said so I mean hopefully that's gonna that's gonna help me along the way like I could so easily be putting out like a beat every night like I just don't feel the need to make anything that the is this thing that is being said every day like I mean no disrespect to anybody you know it's making like I just I just feel like it's important to figure out what hasn't been said and try and make something along the lines or not know I mean I I sympathize with that I mean I think in your music I hear some obvious influences but you're not just trying to like you're you're just not trying to like carry the J Dilla torch or anything like that you know you're trying to sort of forge something for yourself you're not just trying to relive what other established artists have sort of done with their work yeah to me which is something I think is kind of a little I don't know underappreciated in this day and age a little bit I mean as much as we are obsessed with things that are new simultaneously I feel like a lot of people tend to really quickly kind of jump on and cosign things that just kind of have already handed you what you've already heard you know just kind of but just with another artist with another name with another album cover and I I think sort of doing something that's truly different doing something that's like seriously experimental or really the next step for whatever genre you're you're working and that can be kind of a risk yeah I think well the people who have taken that risk the ones with staying power even someone like Flying Lotus like he's never he's never gonna fade into irrelevance no matter what he does in the near future the the thing like the mark that he's already made in the sound of wood music because it's already been certain that in a way I guess saves them from that finite music career we were talking about sure and and I I imagine it's got to be just super exciting to know that sort of you're I mean you're not just signed to some label like what you're doing is is kind of in a way a bit of a cosign yeah you know it's like he he sees yeah I mean obviously he sees your music as something that can work to his labels benefit but I don't think he would be putting it out if he didn't see the artistry and see the the talent in it that's still not real to me to be honest yeah I was just always like Katie was like like I think I easily have more of flying Lois's music on my iTunes and he does themselves like I'm like fine wood mixes from about 2006 and scanned the entire mix for like an unreleased I like something like I could tell if it if it's a fly low song even if it didn't even have like a tracklist like I knew what sentence the answer I got a study that I studied and said I think in a way it kind of made a lot of my oldest shit like when I was first coming up when I was about sixteen like it's pretty derivative like I just people working like I'd be thinking like but what would fight like do I that kind of thing but I don't know it's just insane that came wrong full circle I guess why I think there has to kind of be a point in your music making career where you are doing something derivative obviously not when you're ten or fifteen years into it although that's how it ends up working for some people but at least the starting point I think you have no other choice other than to just kind of make what you know before you sort of create something that you know nobody even foresaw coming down the pipe so so yeah that's that's actually pretty insane that you studied his music that closely to the point I imagine where it just kind of lost its mysticism and you knew exactly what since he was using yeah so is flying Lotus's music and European as somebody who's studied his stuff so closely to the point where you know obviously it's it's you were making music that was incredibly derivative as you say at a time to people who are sort of outside of this world of experimental producers like him and yourself or making the type of music that you are is the music as I guess I want to say mystical as it as technical as is it as complex as it appears to be on the outside or is is there are there some basic truths that once you dive into it that you kind of understand and kind of a basic blueprint that all of these songs work off of that once you understand it it's just like kind of a snap I mean the whole scene scene if you mean not like I don't necessarily see myself I trying to force myself into that anymore but I think that that definitely are like a few tricks that everybody was using like there's a host side-chaining thing why I guess the second I sort of figured that out when I started producing I was like oh like shit it's not easy like some people don't pray simple stuff like it would just be like a jazzy song and then like these dislike like a big kick drum the who-what cytanium does is it it it removes I guess with the sound around it so like you hear the kick but like not much else yeah it's kind of like sopping up the same here as it's popping in and like that was definitely like just this sort of thing that everybody everybody was on but yeah I think the stuff that stuck around I think I stuck around cuz people still don't really know how I don't know like cosmic ramen was made or rusty stuff or Daedalus and stuff and speaking from the position that year that you're in as an artist who sort of came up emulating someone like Flying Lotus and in sort of making this music in a very DIY way tell me is is it kind of a night and day difference in your personal experience whereas at one time you were unsigned but now that you're signed and you're releasing music and you've gotten album and the kind of coming down the pipe do you feel I guess at least the the least bit more secure than you did when you were just kind of I don't know making music on your own or just kind of throwing it out onto the internet and hoping that someone would hear it at some point I feel maybe more under pressure and kind of like a way that I feel like now everybody knows I'm starting to bring freedom I'm like aw fuck like I'm actually got a dilemma like there's like a million other kids like out there who are amazing at making this music stuff I'm like I know I've kind of got to prove that I'm deserving of this stuff and like I'm not no I'm not like I'm not saying I I am and I'm better than everyone else does anything like that I just feel like I have to prove to myself that I can make some crazy shit for this album and is there anything that you feel like you're doing now musically or or sonically that that you're doing that you didn't pull off on this EP or sort of any directions that you're pushing yourself in that are kind of a sort of unknown territory for you um I want to stop messing about with my own vocals I think that's kind of about the final step to making stuff that's more resembling a bucket son rather than like a beat like a I sort of want to I want to like fully leave beat world if you go I mean like I'd I guess the end goal is for people with like him I said and they they tell their friend and they're like oh check out check out this song where I didn't like check out this beat or this instrumental I'll be cool it seems like for that kind of solo electronic music producer for people who are making that beat music it seems like a point of exposure for a lot of them is that they end up working with sort of pop artists or something like that and producing for someone else and then their name kind of gets around around that way is that sort of thing of any interest to you they're like it's like we'd see from mainstream people who I want to work with just cuz they'd be kind of funny to me well like I sort of see something in like that the feel of that voice that I feel like could be fun to play with but I don't know personally for me and kind of thought to just be like a guy who lives in like bracket it's like pudgy spy blah blah blah like and I like some people like some people love doing that like some people love opening up the thing I like that like oh I'm gonna make a be tailored to like I don't know Snoop Dogg but it'll be like really weird like I couldn't see how that would be a vibe and how that could be like stimulating but that's not me hmm so if you're working with anybody else there's got to be somebody who's trying to push things as hard as you are or something gonna be good and you do have a few features on this album I mean are there any other features sort of coming down the pipe and when I say how am I mean uh the EP you released are there any features sort of coming up on this record that you're gonna be dropping - oh I'm not like that far deep into I would say book I mean no this would probably ever happen but one of like my weird dreams is that is to make a song with them like Carrie Palmilla Palmilla you say her name okay yeah yeah I think I'll be fucking crazy like I want to make some like super fast stuff we learn like how a rock was something lovely the coolest thing I think I don't know first step - that could be a really weird remix that somehow generates attention and if that if that happens then I don't know just an idea just a suggestion I mean maybe our people are cool because I think she's doing some stuff with them so if you have PC music maybe the heads see yeah I wouldn't be surprised to hear that and and I know that you've brought that sort of clique up I do want to mention I mean I certainly hear some I don't know it at least what I think is a bit of an influence from that camp I mean it's it seems like you're just pulling from so many places is well-versed in the whole you know fly load discography as you are it seems like you're pulling from so many places and I can't I don't want to say that that you found balance between all of these things because it just sounds like so too much of an onslaught to sort of use a word as kind of calming as balance it's it seems like I don't know like a really intricate Cirque du Soleil like routine on stage with numerous actors kind of all doing insane acrobatics all at once I feel like the stuff I make is purely an amalgamation of the things I listen to you but I guess I wasn't it like I wasn't like a lot of weird Japanese like psychedelic Rogi stuff but then I also I do this like the whole there you know it doesn't there's not even a name for right now but the stuff surrounding PC music it's definitely like for sure for sure a vibe I think folks some people have been calling like softcore like there's some stupid names but I'm sure something will stick eventually but like I know like I know that the people who kind of around that and like I think in a way people people have been comparing my stuff to it just because of the fact that it sounds quite clean like I'm I'm not really using like vinyl II textures like I just tried to limit myself to just the songs I was using rather than just so I'd text over it and I guess PC music have like an emphasis on that book I already get the comparisons as far as like I didn't I wasn't trying to make like we had put music like I wasn't trying to mess about like trying to see synth chords and stuff well that will that clean this I mean that that's that's a texture in and of itself you know it's just not it's not a rough loaf I kind of murky jazzy sort of texture you know like you might catch on a lot of different brain feeder releases but but a lot of those same records do you kind of embrace I don't know this postmodern this futurist kind of sound that it seems like both of your feet are very much in that side of the sound whereas that I don't know that idea of things being more lo-fi more textured noisier it seems like you're certainly informed by that but you've you're you're the next step past it those cool I mean I think like just like the kind of things people were saying like I heard I heard bubblegum base quite a lot like in I don't know like there were these and stuff that people have done and like I think definitely pretty much in every single review that was like a PC music comparison so I mean I'm gonna try and figure out like I like precisely why people are making a comparison and so I think I think it's the bright cents it's the clean production it's the chirpy vocals I want and and and I and I think those are two people who don't produce music those are some really obvious parallels to draw obviously the the when it comes to how busy your music is a lot of the chord progressions you use the weird sonic experiments all that stuff I mean some of that stuff doesn't necessarily apply but I guess it depends on who you're talking about within PC music I mean some of their productions like from Sophie can get kind of off-the-wall yeah yeah but uh but yeah I mean III would say those are probably the the reason why people are drawing those comparisons personally no reason to dive into it that's why telling you right now that's the those are the those are some of the most obvious sort of parallels to draw between those two those two worlds fucking geniuses to me both I think that's probably something I wanted me to post eventually like I want to just like dig myself too deep into the whole thing oh shit I'm gonna fix dog well that's fine I was thinking about wrapping this thing up anyway since you've been such a good talkative guest and kind of pulled the veil back on this music that you're working on moving into the future and I appreciate you sort of being intimate with your answers here and having a kind of frank conversation about what you're doing but in the future is is this kind of idea of staying under this pen name and kind of anonymity and all that stuff is that going to be really sort of important to you and kind of the igloo ghost name I mean I think I spray fudge into sort of boosts it and like I cut already like I mean notice the I'm just talking isn't the real human boy right now but it's pretty fun to create like a sort of fiction or like a lure around yourself like a I'd like to think I've like a light of a few times maybe in this interview just for fun or like I just like to hunt like who they like that I think it's fun to combine real life and boo sit together like it sort of freaks people out a little but I agree and I think it kind of makes it easier to sort of maintain the mysticism around what you're doing which I think going into the future is gonna be really important to the future of a lot of music careers I mean looking back some of the most still today relevant and successful artists have an element of anonymity to what they do people like Daft Punk or MF DOOM even Flying Lotus who even though we know who he is and we've seen him he doesn't do a whole lot of interviews at least not on video at least not on audio he's he seems like a very elusive character and I think that elusive 'ti is really important Death Grips as well artists who kind of lurk back and hang in the shadows I think intrigue a lot of people just kind of giving people everything that there is to know about you might generate interest for a little while but I think unless you're able to kind of continue titillating them and keep up a bit of a sexy facade people lose interest really quickly yeah very sexy well then then what I recommend is that maybe when your career is waning at some point then reveal how sexy you are to the world to generate interest once again maybe do maybe get naked on the cover okay y'all are gonna see some nudes I'll link them to your Twitter page down in the description box so that I imagine you're probably gonna drop them there right yeah it's a lot okay great all right guys well again I want to thank my guest on this episode of the podcast mister igloo ghost for coming on talking about his music and a myriad of other things on this episode of the podcast thank you dude thank you all and you guys are the best thank you for listening again Indiana ghosts forever

cICwHv2Pn-g,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new arch Murr movie move Hey hmm hmm prolific experimental music producer James Ferraro he has a myriad of different albums under his belt at this point covering a range of different styles from the incredibly low PHY rock stylings of night Dolls with hairspray to the vaporwave pinnacle of far side virtual and recently with his newest releases he's been indulging in some ambient pop bedroom pop as well as some alternative R&B like on NYC hell at 3:00 a.m. I do want to say in retrospect I do regret not giving a full shot to the album sushi which now that I really listen to it it actually kind of passed me by the year it dropped in 2012 it is a pretty interesting experimental electronic music album that takes a lot of popular styles of electronic music and twist them into something very left-field but to this newest album over here this record stylistically seems to be taking off from a lot of the R&B and pop music that Ferrara was playing with on his last record except now he's giving us a bit of ambient music and like a bit of sound collage and here as well especially with all of the samples taken from various news broadcasts seems like during the 80s and the 90s specifically stuff oriented around the OJ trial the OJ arrests as well as the Rodney King beating and the LA riots seems like Ferraro is trying to make some kind of statement here on the media news violence especially on the song Sentinel beast where you can really read into the lyrics I like the concept of this record I like what Ferraro it seems like what he's trying to say on this album but as much as I give this record kudos for what it seems to be doing as far as the themes in this music I have to say I don't like the music at all it sounds like I'm listening to a bunch of badly next badly performed soft rock music and pop from the 80s something that might have been the perfect soundtrack to sun-scorched la days and steamy Miami nights if not for the fact that it sounds like Ferraro just played all the instrumentation and edited all the instrumentation while drunk because the instrumentation comes together so sloppily on this record in overpowering way to the point where it's it's like I feel claustrophobic with the music on this record it's like each song is a slowly shrinking room and it's just freaking me out watch out why like on the song to live and die in LA where for the duration of the entire track I'm just waiting for the moments where the keyboards and the drums like line up and sync up in some kind of meaningful way and then the guitar lead that's just kind of wailing away in the background sounds like it's practicing for the next track or something oddly enough though the various saxophone appearances that happen on this album sound pretty decent and actually adds some drama to the very unkempt music the vocals on top of this instrumentation a lot of the time or just singing out of key and bring absolutely no charisma whatsoever to the table as a frontman on this album Ferraro is absolutely drab to listen to except for maybe a few moments on the album where he seems to be kind of delivering his vocals in this very whisper quiet somewhat sensual demeanor that I think is somewhat appealing or at least more appealing that a lot of the vocals on the album again everything about this album musically and instrumentally I just can't stand and the idea of picking out moments that are actually bright spots on here is about as appealing as sticking my arms into a basket of rotten fruit to find the one piece of non rotten fruit here's what I do like about the music and the instrumentation on this record I like the tone of the instrumentation I like the aesthetic of the instrumentation it may sound really sloppy and compositionally it may be really rudimentary and just not interesting or appealing at all but I think the instrumentation has a really cool just Tambor to it it sounds like something out of the late 80s early 90s it sounds incredibly nostalgic it's like I'm taking a time machine back it's this artsy moody smoky noir eerie version of the past it's a dystopian past I almost feel like this album should have not been an album and it should have been some kind of art installation instead with blown-up photographs and projections set to James Ferraro doing poetry of the lyrics on this record and all sorts of old televisions playing VHS loops of the news stories and clips kind of referenced on this album or something so yeah it's just kind of musics answer to the modern art installation or maybe musics answer to the the coffee table book in that it's minimal it's artsy its sleek its aesthetically pleasing but I don't want to thumb through it for more than 15 minutes and if there's another nice thing I can say about this record is that I feel like it's unique it's uniquely interesting in the way that it approaches its concept but musically I think it's uniquely unbearable as well despite not enjoying this album overall I certainly won't be forgetting it anytime soon and I will say that a strong reaction like that for me might warrant at least checking it out you know I would say at least check it out if anything I've described seems even mildly interesting to you and to you to you to you I'm feeling a decent strong 4 on this thing transition have you given this album a lesson oh yeah that's cool forever 
pNlMZ7FIz8o,the hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the latest Sun Record Kent Canon Canon this is the new LP from legendary drone metal duo Sun the highly anticipated follow-up to one of their most celebrated records 2009's monoliths and dimensions six years since the release of that record crazy and this hope he was easily one of their most widely discussed albums one of their most musically diverse albums featuring instrumentation such as large group chorus vocals some harp on the final track which I believe was a tribute to Alice Coltrane even some bells this LP was a very high creative peak for the duo something that I was worried they would never really be able to top but then following this album we just got a lot of studio albums silence sure in the time between this new record and monoliths and dimensions we had plenty of collaborative records one with nurse with wound also one with Oliver another with Scott Walker himself all of which received reviews from across the opinion spectrum now since the release of monoliths and dimensions I've probably caught some live like three or four times each performance was was great and I was just really intensely waiting for the release of their next album and listening to it I can't really say it reached to my expectations honestly it's really no more ambitious than the past several collaboration LPS the Sun is released in recent years I would actually say that the Scott Walker collaborative release is more ambitious sure it's more obnoxious but at least it took more risks there are three tracks on this project that add up to just over 30 minutes not really that long of a Sun project maybe you would have worked better as an EP and looking into the sleeve that comes with the record there's actually quite a bit of text here that goes into the concept behind this album and the record is titled after an East Asian god or goddess depending on who you talk to of mercy and the text here in the sleeve sort of talks about how the fact that this God is gender-fluid in a sense kind of breaks these norms of not only just traditional sexuality but also metal music as well which we don't typically see is kind of a merciful or even a feminist thing it was kind of interesting but I stopped reading the sleeve once the liner notes started to kind of read like a review and there were actual descriptions what was going on in the music but only because I tend to just avoid reading any reviews of any music that I am doing a review for before I've gotten my review out just kind of a general practice for me I don't want to be writing things or saying things that other people are saying or reviewing albums it's just kind of a rule of thumb I think most reviewers should probably work by but then I decided I wasn't going to go back to the liner notes once I found out who wrote them one miss Eliza Schwarz who if you look her up she's a well one sick puppy kind of a self impressed Ivy League art school dimwit who apparently had forced herself allegedly through multiple miscarriages for an art project and reading through what I had read in the liner notes thus far I felt as if she was trying to convince herself of her own BS more than actually communicate anything to me or whoever might be reading what was written in the liner notes this album works in three parts Canon parts one two and three and the intro track doesn't really sound like anything different than what you might have caught during a son live set with Attila fronting them over the past several years same guitar tones very similar vocal deliveries as well as a chord progression that I think son has been recycling now for a while maybe there's a little more detail and a few more layers to the drone that weren't usually there in the live setting which the studio has allowed them to do but other than that there's not really anything that stunning about this introduction track it's kind of a tone setter it sort of just I don't know allows you to know that you're going to be listening to a drone metal album still I do like the twine guitars and I think the production is heavy it's great this thing sounds great on record and I can at least the Sun is working up to a bare minimum quality level that I expect parts two and three of this record are actually way more enthralling I actually again would have wished that maybe these two tracks were just kind of a teaser EP or something on track two it's almost like listening to Attila deliver this sort of Buddhist chant over these very heavy blaring guitars which are even more intense than they were on the first part sometimes the blaring guitars and the vocals are blindingly bright in this way I could see how the music is a little merciful or at least just lighter than what Sun has put out in the past at least over their past few albums the ending has a powerful thunderous Rumble to it and this track is just kind of sun getting back into that heaviness they are sounding powerful once again the third part of this record I think is maybe the most incredible moment on the album the guitar leads are just wailing really piercing through that low and base and those low frequencies get incredibly intense on this track making for just the most monstrous moment on the record atilla's vocals on this track are bellowing actually reminds me quite a bit of him performing with the duo on that dom kirk live record he really changes up his vocals later into the track sometimes sounding like their their croaked and and very uh I don't know mutated very chilling and frightening and in the second half of the track they're these really high-pitched guitar melodies that are just piercing through the darkness it's kind of like these little tiny rays of sunlight just shining through this apocalyptic black cloudy sky just for a moment before the track ends with a really gruff and rough finish if there's a one more thing that I have to say about this track as far as a criticism it's that once again son is handing us another incredibly incredibly familiar chord progression overall I feel like we've been handed a brief but decent son album and the duo has essentially you again like I said earlier worked up to a bare minimum quality level and that's about it there are a few new and refreshing ideas sort of shown on track two and three but they're not so prominent that they actually make it feel like son is doing anything all that new or exciting what literal accompanied instrumentation actually makes it onto this record I wish it was louder just so that the concept of this album it seems could be explored more sonically and musically more than it is explored verbally it's just kind of disappointing honestly a duo known incredibly well for being on the cutting edge and always going the extra mile is not on the cutting edge and isn't going the extra mile in any way shape or form on this thing unfortunately son played it super duper safe on this thing and I don't really think there's anything else to say I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing transition have you given this wrecker to listen if you have what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana son forever 
1PINCtslDvI,ah what's up everyone Antoine Phan Tuan here Internet's busiest music do you know who it'd be and I hope you're doing well we're gonna do a bit of a track review here new Animal Collective track new album on the way the gang is all here you might know these guys they are a wonderful indie and neo psychedelic group they've dropped numerous fantastic albums over the years although in my opinion their last one kind of rough not really the biggest fan of it and I notoriously have not really been that into a lot of the animal collective solo projects to have been released over the years the only thing keeps me interested in the group is that when they convene together to make an animal collective album it's usually part or good and they've had way more hits than misses when it's come to group albums so once again I'm looking forward to a new animal collective record especially given that this new single over here titled flora da da is good a few things about this track sonically aesthetically I feel like the group is kind of going back to that strawberry jam kind of vibe which is sort of weird to think that that album is as old as it actually is now but the sound of this track is very nutty it's very organic it's very cacophonous maybe not as odd as some of that some tongs feels strawberry jam era stuff but it certainly seems to be going back in that direction they've got that old-school vocal layering that you typically expect from animal collectives mm Zaire music as well and simultaneously while this track is kind of left field it's kind of odd it's insanely poppy sort of on the level of pop eNOS and instantaneousness as a lot of those Merriweather Post Pavilion songs I would actually say that this track is even more readable in some ways especially given that the hook is so freakin sing along even on the first listen now the sounds worked in this track they're very flavorful they're very fun it's densely packed and it feels like each piece of instrumentation of melody of percussion is actually working together instead of against one another which I felt was very much the case on centipede hurts the Gergely base on this song the skipping persistent percussion the harmonious synthesizers all of the different vocals playing into this track they all have their own role in place in the mix there's no competition here there's no disarray going on here in the music it's all really tight despite it just feeling kind of oddball and off kilter I think the one noisy moment on the record is we're kind of getting some horns at the 3-minute mark or some very strange synthesizer arpeggios which are kind of drowning out the music and are progressively getting louder and louder and louder and don't really fit into what the music is is doing chord wise or melody wise but it's just adding a little bit of noise it kind of rushes up and disappears creating a bit of a sound gasm in the song and the track goes into its final choruses before it ends on a very tight finish overall it's a good track don't really have much in the way of complaints about this song and I guess I'm looking forward to the next animal collective record which I think all of you should be as well and in this new age of Internet music fandom I feel like we're just too quickly getting sick of these groups who used to make fantastic music and by all means could still be making fantastic music and there's just no reason to really give up on Animal Collective or anything like that to give this record a freaking chance ok so yeah that's it you're the best Anthony Fantino Animal Collective transition what did you think of this track did you love it did you hate it what would you writer and argue excited for this new animal collective record painting with let me know you're the best Anthony Fantana Animal Collective forever hey everyone you know who it is Anthony Fantana coming on here to tell you about our brand new website which we dropped earlier this year so it's not brand brand new but the good people at Squarespace are the reason that we have it and there is a link down there in the description box where you can get at a discount your own website for your home business personal hobby whatever I'm also here to tell you that on this website brought to us by Squarespace we also have a playlist that we released pretty recently it is a Bjork playlist starter pack so if you've been kind of waiting to get into Bjork you don't exactly know where to start or anything like that we have given you a series of tracks that are worth checking out and should get you well on your way to becoming the world's most preeminent Bjork expert and that's about it thank you for loving thank you for hating have a nice day forever 
FExNHGFlRX4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new john benjamin album well I should have John Benjamin is a famed jazz pianist who had a very young age was found to be a prodigy when the jazz community actually studied under the great mr. Duke Ellington who helped him get his chops up to where they are today I'm kidding John Benjamin is actually a comedian a writer and an actor more specifically a voice-over artist you might remember him from such animated television shows like dr. Katz as well as Bob's Burgers where he plays uh Bob and one of my favorite characters he's ever played coach McGuirk on home movies which I still think is a one of the greatest shows to ever grace television and on this album john benjamin has teamed with Sub Pop Records to release a jazz album where he is featured on piano the issue though is that Jon Benjamin does not know how to play jazz piano hence the title of this record well I should have learned to play piano but despite this he has been paired with guest musicians on this project who actually do know how to play their instruments bass drums sax all of which is brought to the table by these fine gentlemen their performances they're playing on this record it's tight it's not too flashy but it is competent and on point I guess there may even be a few performance highlights on this thing like Scott's saxophone on the band's rendition of it had to be you is playing is very fluid and he does the song just about as much justice as you could do considering John's very sour playing in the background kind of ruins the mood of the song and Dave's bass solo on I can't play piano part one is actually pretty fantastic today today - David do - did it's actually so good it kind of causes John Benjamin to yell out in some kind of fit in the middle of the solo I think he actually yells play it Joe which is kind of confusing since I don't know of anybody involved in these sessions whose name is Joe maybe it's kind of a play on the idea of like of the phrase play it Sam or play it again Sam but that seems like a bit of a stretch or maybe that's not what he was saying at all I don't know but this is one of many occasions where John Benjamin is is yelling during the recording and I guess kind of whipping the band up into a frenzy of really intense playing every everyone except him really because John Benjamin's piano playing on every track of this album is god-awful especially on moments like it had to be you listening to John play with this band on this record is kind of like watching someone with two left feet try to dance during a ballroom competition with a decorated champion dancer but I guess that in general is a part of John Benjamin's comedy style putting himself in situations that are painfully awkward and destined for failure although I will say when it comes to his playing his performances on this thing I will respect his time and his rhythm on a lot of these tracks it's not really as off as you would expect given that the selling point of this album is that John Benjamin doesn't know how to play piano again he sort of hits a lot of his marks when he sort of needs to be soloing or I guess kind of backing up the rest of the instrumentation if only he were playing the right notes and chords but that actually kind of puts us in a position where we could play a pretty fun prank with this record if you want to see who the most pretentious person in your friends circle is grab this album have your buddies come over put the record on but before it's on just say hey this is a really great jazz album just found out about this jazz record the piano is especially good just let it play let one of these tracks play out and just kind of see what their reaction is see if any of your friends are like oh yeah Wow his playing is amazing and if anybody actually does say that or tries to really kind of understand the record see where he's coming from yeah he's really playing a different man that you know have a laugh and that's pretty much the vibe of every single track here especially the songs I can't play piano parts one two three and for which make up a bulk of the album thankfully the songs are short they are punchy they are very basic and straightforward the album lasts about 30 minutes so the joke doesn't get drawn out for too long but that's not to say that every single song has the same exact thing going on I mean for example part three of I can't play piano sees John and Scott on piano and sax kind of trading places back and forth and John it's almost like during some of his performance here he's like given up on trying to sound halfway or even part of the way decent as he's just kind of running his fingers up the piano keys and Dave it's almost as if Dave is trying to either emulate John's really noisy bad notes sometimes or maybe kind of tease a musical idea out of him that sounds halfway good and I can't play piano part 4 has a bit of a Latin vibe to it especially coming from the rhythm section but John's piano playing make sure that the song goes down like some day-old Taco Bell now this album ends as all great jazz album should with a 1 minute and 30 second song about butt sex yes it is kind of a rap rock song with john benjamin rapping about that sweet sweaty butt sex and outside of that there's not really anything else to say about this album it's a maybe a good gag record to buy for somebody the jazz lover in your life you certainly could play that joke that i mentioned earlier with some of your buddies and aside from that i mean this thing is um what hey transition have you given this rucker to listen and if you have what you thinking did you love it if you hate it why what do you think i should review next and that's it Antoine Phan Tuan mr.

-T4jHJHUdFA,uh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the ever loose of track review where i come onto this channel and talk to you about the newly released song but in this review songs two tracks freestyles remixes that were dropped this past friday they're both titled black friday and they're from two different artists mr. Kendrick Lamar and mr. J called to contemporary rappers who can't really not get mentioned in the same breath mostly because both of them occupy a similar space in the current hip-hop consciousness where they're both attached to social issues they're both known to deliver some very thoughtful lyricism this has drawn a lot of comparisons some of which have been made by me and also fueled a lot of debates over who's better which one's the greatest artists and then after that there's also fantasies fantasies of some kind of full-length massive large-scale collaboration in this past Black Friday we might have gotten a hint that that collaboration may be happening with these two tracks early next year February if we are to go on one of the lines the closing lines from this J Cole Black Friday track where he seems to be referencing that people can handle a collaboration between him and Kendrick but it's about to get scary in February in a lot of ways Kendrick Lamar J Cole R this decades Mos Def and Talib Kweli and then collaborating together on a full-length project that that could be this decades black star now with these two Black Friday tracks Kenny and Cole they just traded two beats from their latest projects and they wrapped over one another's beats and the vibe that I get from these two tracks is not so much that it's a competition as much as it's a collaboration it's two different rappers creatively enticing fans getting people excited delivering some new content without feeding directly into the meme machine as a lot of newer rappers do look at it you Drake looking at you feeding into that meme machine amen I got memes - what are you gonna do on Kendricks side of this collaboration he delivers again is very expressive ever-changing flow one moment during his free style he's breaking down emotionally he makes reference in this verse to his last album where he flowy together rock and roll in black soul as well as jazz fusion and trap the speedy flow he goes into once he drops that higher power bar that moment in the song is incredibly dense amazing one line that sticks out is that he's rolling deep in the paper like to Adele's the handful of lines he drops about voting for Kanye for president and then going wild in the White House and then of the final bars on this track where he's really going in he says himself he's going to slay it Kendrick really holds nothing back on this verse I can't really say it's a controversial like his infamous control verse was but he delivered the talent level that I as listener of his have come to expect up until this point now as far as J Cole's side of this collaboration I think there aren't as many quotables here honestly nor is he making verses that are as densely packed as what Kendrick did on his Black Friday cut however he is more charismatic than I think he was on a lot of the songs from his last project and there are some lines that had me just going whoa like if I quote it I wrote it well as well as a one line about how there are no snakes in the grass because he mowed it well the final moments on this track especially during the spot where he's rapping about the collaboration him and Kendrick can't have he really picks up the flow picks up the intensity he ends it strong even though I'm not totally following his logic during that part where he's talking about how he's paid enough taxes to fund Japan whatever just kind of felt like he was reaching on that line and just through in a country any country that would have fit his rhyme scheme at that point and then we have the second third of the song that I think no after this little interlude Ricola is doing a lot of singing really would have rather some rapping but he's singing and I feel like it's a bit of a dead zone here especially as he says he sold out the Staples Center he's talking about money but simultaneously when other rappers talk about money that's just because they don't have anything else to talk about well then what are you doing I don't know especially as he delivers a line right after where he says he's got suicide doors slit his wrists not the best verse I've heard from Cole but certainly likable I'm just once again kind of mild on a track that he's delivered he just doesn't blow me away he doesn't give me those hard thoughtful energetic punches like Kendrick usually does but still I see the talent level I recognize it I respect it and I don't think a collaboration with him and Kendrick would necessarily be bad there are two distinct voices two very different sides of a similar coin and I could see them working together really well J Cole's directness might benefit Kendrick a little bit because he does tend to be a little heady and he does tend to need some reading into to really understand what he's saying and Kendricks energy and ambition and tendency to just kind of push things to another level could certainly give J Cole a different angle so I like these tracks favoring the Kendra track though sorry to all the J Cole fans and all the people out there who hate me for just enjoying Kendricks music so much just I don't know what the fuck to tell you I don't know what to tell you I just just preferences man preferences I don't know well having said that what did you think of these two tracks which do you prefer are you preferring Cole's preferring Kendricks do you like both of them equally and are you anticipating a full length collaboration of some sort a mixtape an album and if it happens what is the likelihood that it would be great amazing grimacing let me know your thoughts you're the best Anthony Fantan Oh kendrick lamar j cole transition have you given these tracks a listen and what do you think about them do you love them d hate them why what do you think next and that's it Anthony Fantino J Cole Kendrick Lamar 
sNmdm1s4SyM,Walker flinging Walker lady walk up lady Walker hi everyone Antoine Phan Tuan here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new waka flocka flame mixtape flock of Ellie 1.5 waka flocka flame is an Atlanta rapper who broke through in 2010 with the prequel to this new mixtape over here flock of Ellie he dropped this album he started his career really under the guidance of mr. Gucci Mane legendary trap rapper and when this record blew up when the singles off of this record blew up it was kind of a game changer waka and producer Lex Luger on this album took trap music and they gave it something more than just a subject matter they gave it a sound with the just monstrously loud and booming an overwhelming sub bass the rattling twittering high hats that just go off like machine guns on this record a sound that countless rappers have copied up until this point people who are more small-time and independent to people like jay-z and Kanye West when they started promoting that Watch the Throne collaboration that came out with that ham single that a lot of people reacted negatively to and it initially came out now waka flocka himself as an artist became incredibly polarizing people were on one side of the fence saying he's an exciting new artist he's doing something different he's incredibly savage energetic in your faces energy level just is uncompelled and then there were others and I definitely fit into this camp at the time who reacted more negatively to the music saw it as mindless saw it as just not all that interesting not a lot of depth not a lot of substance there were people who are real hip-hop heads and deep into the lyrical side of the genre who saw this music essentially as trash especially since there were numerous lines on this album where waka was just rhyming words with this with the exact word itself to create bars to finish the verses but in retrospect it was definitely artistry to this record and there were reference points you know great reference points to what waka was doing on this record artists like three 6 mafia and Gucci Mane as well as the crunk music which was incredibly relevant in the previous decade but even though I do have praised for flaca vely in retrospect it's kind of easy to see that there's not a whole lot of technical ability behind what laka was doing and as a result he was quickly drowned out by just a league of copycat artists who were equally as savage and were hopping on production that was very much like what was featured on flock of Ellie combine that with the fact that waka had a pretty weak follow-up collaborative project with gucci mane as well as the album triple-f life which didn't do too well for him it was kind of like listening to him add some nuance and some other dimensions to what he was doing and he just didn't really sound that great taking a softer approach in his music one I don't really think it was what his fans were looking for from him and to this album seemed almost like a response to the many criticisms that were being thrown at him over his music not having this not having that not doing this not doing this other thing that we think all hip-hop albums should do so now it seems that waka flocka is trying to go back to his roots and he announced that by telling everyone he was trying to drop a sequel to flock of Ellie but his label has kind of stood in the way of that and said that he could not release that new album until he builds up some kind of hype some kind of demand for this record and it seems that that is what he's trying to do with this mixtape over here get mouths watering get interest generated again now this thing is 15 tracks of just non-stop savagery it takes the production style of Flocka valley the original flock of ellie adds a little bit of musical nuance to it and and not so much that it takes away from the aggression of the songs but it seems like there's a bit more musical depth to what's going on here a little bit more a little more variety if there's one thing that still works against flock ability for me is that it feels somewhat one-dimensional and I can only handle like a little bit of that record at a time before I just kind of get sick of it but still this new mixtape hits incredibly hard it is the sound of bullets and cars with very expensive sound systems whizzing by your house now lyrically waka is dealing in a lot of the same topics and subject matters money violence drug dealing and the rap game as well but I can't deny that his verses sound a little better on this one he's not rhyming words with themselves on this thing he's not delivering a whole lot of wordplay but when he is rapping he kind of centers on a single topic a lot of the time or his verses actually string together like a coherent thought again even if he's not venturing outside of those topics you would typically expect him to approach like on the intro track here shootin which is you know basically about shooting guns at the opps or the song blue or red where essentially wakka is saying that it doesn't really matter what gang you're a part of though he does seem to claim Piru on this project on numerous occasions but again any person of any gang it seems doesn't really matter what side they're on can get it if they we have the songs trapping and rapping and rap game up where essentially wakka has a foot in the drug world and a foot in the rap world because of the fact that things were a little turbulent for him as far as his rap career for a bit and one of my favorite tracks on here and maybe the most unexpected track on here has to be the song birthday where I think this song has a lot of viral potential and it's essentially just this wild-ass off-the-wall birthday song with my birthday and some of the lyrics on the song are just like the line about nothing in the world matters now because my birthday like it's it's your birthday it's not the apocalypse but still it's it's it adds to the hilarity of the track it's a fun freakin track the track just has monstrous charisma behind it and a lot of humor so wocka while he may not be delivering a whole lot in the world of wordplay on here his energy level is really what sells these songs and his aggression level to is incredible like on the song shootin or work in one of the hardest songs in the track listing here as well as feel about me we're walkers flow is super fast he really improved his flow on this record not only is his flow speedy on here but as he is rapping a very high-speed for him he continues this raspy yelling junkyard dog delivery with his voice that's a pretty attention-grabbing walk it does try to change it up a little bit stylistically like on the song lose my mind where he's got kind of an auto-tuned flow that seems a little future ish on that a.m. to p.m. track he's got a bit of a triplet migos flow going on and i also want to note that there is actually a me ghost feature on this tape though it seems to be uncredited at least it wasn't credited on the mixtape version of this album that i downloaded although it is pretty underwhelming nothing really to make note of here that migos feature and on the closing track here wakka tries to get kind of personal and emotional much like he did on flock of Ellie but the closing track there as he tried to I don't know kind of tell the audience the the issues he was having in the rap game and so on and so forth it just sounded so goofy it was just so hard to take seriously but instead here he's actually incredibly compelling as he's rapping about being portrayed by his friends as he's rapping about having a bit of a fallout with gucci mane just sort of having issues getting his career started and just continuing doing what he's doing and sort of chasing after his dream here I will say there are some tracks here that do pale in comparison to others and there are a few moments where the hooks aren't exactly that great or they're just incredibly redundant and don't add anything to the song like on the song no not no that no that but overall this is a solid tape I don't really have too many complaints about this one consider my interest piqued this thing was hard as hell it was in your face as hell it was just tough as frickin nails again there isn't a lot in terms of lyrical substance here that I can praise so I will admit I will say that this tape is a little bit of a thrill for me it does get that blood pumping it does sort of appeal to that primal instinct of joy there's many songs that are anthemic or game changers on here because this is really five years after the release of flock of Ellie what can you really do with this sound that he didn't do five years ago but he's still keeping it entertaining at least that's undeniable at least to my years I'm feeling a strong 72 a light eight on this thing transition have you given this tracker to listen did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana walk a five flame forever 
iVwybRCbrG0,hey everyone Anthony fan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd ah I hope you all are doing well it's time for a vinyl update where I tell everyone basically records that have made it into my record shelf recently and I have to admit this bunch over here not really sure if they're going to fit in here not really sure if they're going to fit ever really um I might need to get another shelf I've reached the point in every record collectors life where you need more shelving because you've got more vinyl so what what are you gonna do you know I mean I did I don't spend money on beer or anything like that and I don't frivolously toss my money away on any other sorts of hobbies so you know it's really just kind of music it's really just kind of Records for me you know so when I have a few stair bucks here and there it's I go pick up a record I've been anticipating or that I've been wanting or that I really have been needing to hear so or if I just kind of want to have it around you know in in physical form so we're going to need a bigger boat here you know so thank you for watching these so consistently up until this point is kind of sharing in the record collecting experience with me I do want to mention before I go into these records these final updates are sponsored by the good people over at vinyl me please they are a monthly vinyl of the Month Club they send you exclusive pressings of some obscure but some tried true classic and amazing records they might send along some colored vinyl or something like that that hasn't been pressed before or some special art a myriad of different things usually come with these records and some background in information as well you can find a link down in the description box if you are at all interested in this service cool cool all right let's get into it before I get into the records here I actually have a few things from other physical mediums I went to the record store today because red scroll records the record scorer store close to me where I scored they asked me to do a little hour-long DJ set on Black Friday which I said I was down so I headed down there I did that and I just kind of scoured the store for a little bit although they were very busy I didn't want to kind of spend too much time in there because it was you know again it was crowded a lot of people in there for Black Friday because there was a sale and so on and so forth so I went in there and ever since they started selling cassette tapes excuse me they've been really growing their collection kind of growing that wall of cassette tapes over at that store so I decided now I would just kind of look into it and I picked up a few good tapes I got the self-titled Tom Tom Club album which this is a nice little me I don't know let me just try to get this in close over here oh there we go Tom Tom Club if you're into a little bit of 80's pop and New Wave look this thing up I'm haven't tried this tape yet but I got a great tape deck that a buddy of mine sold to me for a nice hundred bucks so I decided I was going to start you know picking up more tapes Tom Tom Club right here if you're looking for some nice New Wave music some really cool songs on here try out the track genius of love is actually a really great song so I recommend that one and I got some punk tapes over here from one of my favorite punk bands of all time let's see Dead Kennedys right here we have in god we trust' incorporated plastic surgery disasters and the album Franken Christ these are fantastic Punk albums if you are at all interested in punk music if you're looking to get into punk music if you're looking for some projects some albums to sample this is very politically charged melodic fun off-the-wall colorful punk music with a lot of opinions a lot of character a lot of personality I already have these albums I'm probably not going to keep all the way I'm going to keep this one over here I've always wanted this either on tape or on LP the other two I'm probably going to give it to a good good buddy of mine who turned me on to the band so that's probably what I'm going to do and I actually grabbed a cassette tape from a Connecticut punk band that I haven't heard of in a while 76% uncertain they had this one song called I hate the radio which I remember I used to jam that song all the time in high school and I don't know how old this tape is this might be like a reissue or something like that I'm not totally sure but I saw this and I recognized the name and then I said oh you know they had some songs that are really freaking loved and they kind of had a nice little J card in here with a lot of extra information sort of like some homemade printed so I'm kind of looking forward to trying that alright so let's get this back in focus I also want to shout out a few things that had been sent to me by a few people before I get into the vinyl um the guys over at injury reserve you guys might know at this point the Arizona hip-hop outfit whose mixtape live the dentist office is one of my favorite releases of this year or view to give it a very positive review they dropped a CD version of this album look these guys up if you haven't heard this tape it's a great very progressive very forward-thinking jazz rap album with a lot of funny lines a lot of charisma a lot of great verses a lot of stellar beats great hooks is an awesome freaking tape and a great debut and this this CD that they dropped I mean the CD itself it's it seems pretty homespun which is fine you know it's totally cool if you want to sort of take the opportunity to support the group but one thing that it seems like was sort of to my CD and it looks like there were only like 30 of these and it's this it says right here this is number 14 this little booklet that came with the CD and this isn't just some CD that this isn't just some booklet that comes with any CD it's a injury reserve issue one the making of live at the dentist's office and it talks about the history of the group it talks about this is talking about yes okay so so you get a little bit of insight into the lyrics it gives you a gear list over here the gear that was used to make this thing also stories behind the features the people who appeared on here how they met how they got them on to the project and also the samples that went into this thing I don't know if I should read these aloud of mine might be blowing the guys up get them in trouble or something I don't know but it tells you the samples that go into the thing and this one page over here how a project comes together it talks about the various songs on the project and it says March 15th beat reworked June 2015 beat made June 2015 version I 2015 curtis's verse re-recorded you know or recorded or whatever so it's kind of like each one of these tracks is being pieced together over a course of months and it's just really interesting to sort of get that insight into the creative process of this thing yeah it's just like a really cool little package hopefully these guys will print sort of more booklets like this because that's a really nice addition and even if they don't you know if and you like this project or if you haven't heard this project yet go give it a try and if you love it do take the opportunity to support these guys and pick up a CD or pick up something because I would love to see more from these guys in the future and the other thing sent to me was something from my buddy Amir who is a fellow music writer and he sent me this that I've not thumbed through quite yet although it looks pretty it looks kind of involved you know it's it's like really interesting and uh it's it's okay I'm just going to show you what it is it's called the art of sampling the word I was looking for was comprehensive just looking through it it seems like he's talking about stuff from copyright law to just how to technically sample something so he's really getting into the aesthetics of it he's really getting into the how-to of it and talking about just how people perceive it critics the the court system just all that stuff with a little bit of history as well and of course like I just said you know issues of copyright the art of sampling one of the most innovative music processes to emerge in the late 20th century stands today as both celebrated as an art form and a cultural activity within hip-hop and rap movement tradition and beyond the art of sampling examines the complex and controversial music process and presents a study that illuminates the history creative mechanism mechanics and philosophy of sampling while also exploring the implications that it holds for copyright law so yeah again sounds very comprehensive and I'm going to be trying to take a look at this over the next few weeks and yeah I mean it looks like some cool so thank you to a mere for sending this my way alright finally the vital here we are here it is there's nothing standing between you and the vinyl right now okay pick this up today because I guess in a way today is technically Black Friday not it's it's Black Friday the day that I'm shooting this video but it's also like a extension of Record Store Day it's not the Record Store Day in April that we all sort of know and love and participate in most of us anyway but it is a a Record Store Day event for some releases and I got a pic I got I got a copy of this Sun cannon oh my I can't even believe it it's out it's here it's in my hands I've been anticipating this uh-uh-uh and it looks beautiful it's glossy it's wonderful I can't I'm going to review this ASAP because now I have it so I already know I had a stream access to a stream a digital copy but I just really wanted to pick up this vinyl and spoil the record for myself and just get it and it's white it's a beautiful white record oh my yeah yeah oh and it looks like this new Sun project has a few familiar faces on it and consists of just simply three tracks 12 minutes and 50 seconds 9 minutes 11 minutes it's just a three track project and it looks like there's some really involved stuff going on in the gatefold right here looks like a bit of a story of how the record has come together so that'll be really intriguing to read into as I'm listening to the record so yes the new Sun it's in my hands hopefully it's in your hands as well if you wanted this thing and if it's not now hopefully it is in the future I picked this up three bucks how could I say no I'm a fan especially of her input on the Fleetwood Mac records Steven X Stevie Nicks belladonna there's some great hits on this thing edge of 17 gotta love that Stevie Nicks three bucks got this Stevie Nicks for three bucks and yeah I mean got a lyric sheet pretty simple straightforward vinyl pressing right here really no muss no fuss three bucks Stevie Nicks some classic rock and pop right there cannot go wrong also another sort of used record and older record that I picked up a bit of a classic you could say got a copy of Roxy music's country life shield your eyes children tell the children to leave the room really I don't know if I should be showing this right now kind of afraid but if you're looking for some classic rock some not classes I mean it's it's classic sort of in an age sense but I mean it's it's some interesting art rock music definitely look into this roxy music record country life alright switching gears into something a lot more new and also unwrapping it because i just got it today and I've been kind of waiting on it well sort of waiting to get the chance to sort of go down to the store and actually pick up this copy that I reserved so when my favorite records of this year and I usually make it a point to purchase a copy and support the albums that have been my favorites of the year we have the new Julia halter album have you in my wilderness out on Domino Records and there's the download card already got a copy though I love this album it's so great it's such a great dream pop album it's a great baroque pop album some really good songwriting I love Julia's voice and just uh again kind of a no muss no fuss package wonderful gray label very a really really sticking to those neutral colors those earthy neutrals on here and I love the little touch of photography that comes on the inner sleeve as well I can't wait to listen to this on vinyl and sort of see if the really great drums an upright bass on this thing or sort of enhanced by being thrown on to a an analog medium so it'll be interesting to sort of give this a listen now this next couple of things right here are 12-inch singles that were sent to me by the good people over Italians do it better I didn't mention these in the last vinyl update because I hadn't given them a listen but these are two 12-inch singles we have glass candies feeling without touching and glass candies ghetto boys I love this this is really nice labeling let me have the flip sides this is really odd ball pop music this is some really low Phi whole spun strange pop music it doesn't sound too skilled I love that beautiful pink it doesn't sound that skilled but but the amateurish charm of it is really appealing it's dreamy it's odd it sounds like it's coming from another dimension or something you know it does not sound like your average lo-fi pop music and I appreciate that this one's the the same kind of rosy pink which is a really cool I thought when I first put my eyes on these I was like I might not like this you know it's it's I feel bad sometimes if someone sends me a record I don't end up caring for it but I actually ended up enjoying these quite a bit there's just some really again oddball pop music with a lot of I don't know personality to it a little bit of a spunk so definitely check out these glass candy songs again ghetto boys and feeling without touching now these next five records are all from the same artist and they were essentially me treating myself for my birthday my birthday was this October this past October and on my birthday I bought myself these records I bought myself these records and they came in the mail and they are essentially pretty much every microphones record that phil album himself had reissued through his own label fill al vermin son so we have let's go through them all we have don't wake me up we have it was hot we stayed in the water of course we have the glow part too we have song Islands and we have the legendary book to sit myself in the  face we have a legendary Mount Erie record you may notice that some of these have alternate covers because this is not the cover that sort of came with the original Mount Airy release this is the legendary Mount Erie record that Phil elephant put out under the microphones name before he changed to the name Mount Airy and now he just sort of releases music under this name and these are great reissue packages Phil never really disappoints when it comes to reissuing records or really just putting out new records because the packaging is always great I mean for one we get this really cool little plastic sleeve that sort of comes on the side of the record over here where you get the track listing it's kind of like a I don't know a bit of a binder enhancer over here and even the even the records over here that are just simply one LP I mean they're all gate folds and it's actually really cool this one actually has a bit of a poster insert with it with yeah lyric sheet which is really cool just really involved stuff and it wasn't really that bad of a price for something that seems so involved seem so intricate and in a really nice way sort of tributes all these really great releases and Phil elrom a music career so yeah that was just basically the whole wake me up package that I showed you there and each record here as far as packaging goes is just as elaborate the other ones I guess you could say are probably some of them anyway are more elaborate because you're talking about a double LP instead of a single LP you know so yeah again Phil did a really a great job with these I think he kind of outdid himself a little bit and I'm going to be very happy to sort of you know throw these in my case over here next to my other records that I that I own from him and so there you go just try not to mess up that binder just try not to mess up this behind your slip BAM got that in there that's a sample one more of these let's just get into the glow part two because I recently did a classic review of that and I'm sure that's the album at most of you are the most familiar with so you know we have this really cool binder slip over here with a nice little gold emblem in here which is nice Phil Phil you're doing a good job Phil Phil good job so and this is man it's just like a really nice matte type finish over here it's not you know too glossy or anything like that there's a bit of a shine on it a bit of a sheen on it but it's actually a very nice and again over here we have an insert that comes with the record we have tons of it looks like you know it's it looks like just handwritten lyrics sheet it's actually quite nice and adds to the sort of DIY mythical ethos of the record microphones glow part two very very neat some very moody grey sky photography yeah again I mean really great packaging I just knew you know I waited a while to do this I knew that he had released the album's a while ago but I just so happen to remember that he did so on my birthday so I was just like bucket man it's my barter so let's just grab it and also support him in the process because he does a good thing and he makes this world less dark we also have another little cool insert that came in here and that is basically the vinyl update these are the records that I wanted to show you that recently made it into the shelf over here are you going to stop are you gonna me camera are you gonna me up thank you alright I appreciate you watching I appreciate you riding with me on these vinyl updates and let me know down in the comments if you picked up anything interesting recently that might have made it into your vinyl shelf and you're the best Anthony Fantana Boing all forever

Edie Vater and you may know him as the youtuber infidel Amsterdam who is basically the most metal fucking youtuber that I know of he's been doing it for how long have you been doing your channel and sort of where and and sort of when did it start I started my channel in 2007 and so you've been doing this longer than me haha yeah but for some reason you were more successful than me because I checked out your subscribers and I was like holy shit this guy's like on five five hundred thousand more than five hundred thousand I'm app optimist I'm a pop panderer and and I'm just like you know I I just say I just say popular stuff is great for the views yeah that's that's just what I'm doing yeah in the end it's for the viewers and you know for them to enjoy it and to discover some new music so that's basically what we do it for but yeah I started out in 2007 and every once in a while I uploaded a video and then you can like it email like somebody responded to your video and that's that called shit and you check out the comment and they say and it's at like a great video and you're completely proud and that's kind of cool that you see to which level a divulge if you upload a video and it's being watched three hundred times with it in like a half hour so sure yeah that's it's kind of cool how that develops from from the start so some of your earliest videos were you sort of doing a lot of reviews I know I know a lot of your videos don't tend to have a very formal delivery to them it's almost as if you're kind of talking to your fans and in a very intimate way it's kind of more like a metal powwow and an update than it is you know you're kind of giving your fans the metal news or something like that but people really seem to kind of be taken with it and it seems to have formed a really cool insular community around what you're doing yeah you know I mean I also watch some other youtubers and even the bigger ones and it seems as if a lot of youtubers upload videos and are completely distant from the people that are watching it they never respond to comments and you know they keep like a big distance and I personally think that at least in mentally we have this well group feeling you know we're all brothers and sisters from each other also although that might sign sound a little bit corny but you know it I do have that feeling that the viewers are the people that have brought my channel to the level where where it's now so yeah also when I meet people at concerts and festivals a lot of people are a little bit afraid to approach me to ask me a question or like hey are you doing that I am today and I'm like you know I'm just a normal guy and I make my videos for you guys and I'm always sitting there with a cup of coffee and just you know talking away and yeah just like to keep it a little bit light and not to well have you set up to sound a little bit like an authority you know I mean I'm always open for input from people feedback and if people say like hey you got that wrong you know that's just yeah I think it creates a much more nicer atmosphere than keeping all that distance between you and your viewers this is a question I was gonna ask later but I think I might jump into it now because you two just mentioned it the idea of this kind of brotherhood and sisterhood this community in metal yeah what is it exactly you think about metal music or the metal community that kind of fosters that atmosphere um well I think metal has always been the outcast of all the genres out there you know you got your rap and you got hip-hop and R&B and your pop music and metal has always been the outcast you know it well at least not too much been shown on television when you hear a song on the radio it's always something from Metallica which everybody could enjoy it like nothing else matters and that creates like an atmosphere when you see another metal hat that you go like hey that's another guy of that listens to metal and you put up the horns and the other guy puts up the horns and it creates like a bond without even having been talking to each other you know that you listen to a kind of music that's not really popular with great great masses so yeah I think it's like kind of like motorcycle drivers amongst each other when they meet each other they give each other a greeting I think it's kind of like that you know it's it's we're the outcasts in the music and I think that's what creates the bond i I have to agree with a lot of what you're saying and I mean somebody who like me identifies as somebody who is really obsessive with music you know the idea of kind of being very nerdy with music it's it's surprising to me that when I do my reviews or when I talk to other people who kind of identify with me and identify with what I'm doing that they're not just bigger metal fans in general because to me metal while it is one of the most macho genres it's also one of the nerdiest genres of music we've got part of the reason I'm I think it's so cool you know it's it's it's it's sort of nerdy in the sense that it's fans are super passionate about yeah what they're passionate about and they don't care what other people think about their passion you know yeah I'm really in it for the art and they're not in it for sort of what anybody thinks or kind of the social status or anything like that yeah you know it's just all about what the music is yeah exactly I mean we you know the metalheads buy a lot of merchandise t-shirts and and vinyl entities and even the limited items when there have been brought out boxes with with flags in it and patches and we I mean I'm sipping my coffee now from a mug which has venom on there their venom mugs oh yeah it's it says black metal and then with with the devil on it and so yeah I mean I'm 36 and I still do that kind of stuff you know so yeah I just like to say this it's kind of a nerdy genre there are a lot of people always interested in topics that many people just leave aside you know like like darker stuff horror or stuff people dress their houses up in a hora way I mean I got skulls all around I got that big throne standing in my living room and a lot of people are like Jesus Christ who would put that in this house you know and then they see what kind of music you listen to you and yeah it's it's when I say to people when I visit their houses during my work like yeah I listen to heavy metal almost 9 out of 10 people like yeah I kind of had a clue you know and that doesn't really happen with I don't want to call people normal or regular but regular people that say like you know I listen to this I mean if I see my colleagues and they say like I wish to Dutch music where I listen to transit it could go anyway but a lot of metal hats tend to express and to show the world that they listen to heavy metal and I don't see that happen a lot with other genres actually yeah I mean the other other music cultures certainly have you know their own approaches to fashion yeah I guess sometimes even decorating their houses or tattoo artist you know tattoo and just kind of a have a certain way of dressing or handling themselves yeah so that they can kind of broadcast their tastes and their lifestyle to the world but but probably one of the most recognizable I guess cultural fashion statements in relation to music is is most definitely metal yeah I mean you can just pick them out within a split second I mean you can see a lot of people and you see people wearing well I don't want to call it hip-hop clothing because hey what do I know about hip-hop but you know you see people walking around and they could be listening to any kind of music but when you see a metalhead walking around you go like yeah that's another one so well it's kind of interesting about that point about hip hop is that over the past I want to say you know since the 90s in the 2000s and today what kind of qualifies as hip hop fashion has changed a lot I mean you know throughout the 2000s I mean you had a lot of the the baggy clothing sports themed clothing the very baggy jeans the do-rags and a lot of that stuff is very out of fashion right now okay and you know right now these days you have a lot of skinny jeans and really like high-end name-brand shirts and a variety of different things and a lot of these artists who are still dressing like they're out of the 2000s it's almost like they're out of date thing is over over that same course of time metal fashion has very much you know stayed the same I mean the denim jackets the leatherback it's all fabulous yeah exactly that hatches chain wallets jeans beards yes you know and if you're into if you're a little bit more known into metal then you can even pick out the genres that I listen to you know I mean black metal fans wear a leather jacket with spikes on it and long black hair and well not all but it's kind of a stereotype but every once in a while you see a stereotypical person that listens to a certain genre you know you can pick out the Thrasher's and the death metal guys and the black metal guys and even the deathcore guys you can just pick them out by the clothing that they're wearing I think personally that's pretty funny because you kind of think to yourself like okay I bet these guys this guys listening to creator and all sorts of strass stuff and then when you start talking to you goes like yeah my favorite genre is trash man I was like yeah see I was right that's kind of funny to watch that from a distance oh yeah absolutely I mean over here in Connecticut we have a pretty deep history in the hardcore scene on East Coast and a lot of those hardcore guys a lot of those metalcore guys I mean you could spot him from a mile away so so you know kind of going back further into the past your past I guess you know obviously uh I don't think anybody is is born a metalhead it's very much a choice yeah so I guess my question is sort of what was that entry point for you into the genre and when did you kind of realize that this was a culture that you were a fan of and kind of wanted to to be a part of well it's pretty funny because I went to what we what you guys would call a high school and we were in the first class and was this small little nerdy guy with glasses and everybody picked on him and I was always the bigger guy who'd be the stronger guy so people tried to mess with me but I you know I kind of made sure that they didn't do it again and I became friends with the outcasts back then already I became friends with him and he listened to metal before I did and I always listen to the music that my mom and dad were listening to like to Tom Jones and anger burned Engelbert Humperdinck and stuff like that and so one day he came to school and he had a tape recorder with him or our tape player and he told me like have you ever listened to this before and I was like what's that and he showed me a tape of the band frenum and that's why you know that's why venom has such a special place for me um and I was like not never listen to it and he put it on in the first song was black metal and I was completely sold from the first two three tones I was like holy fucking shit this is some awesome stuff and from that moment on he was like yeah you should listen to this and then he came with a Metallica tape and a slayer tape and then I remade in tape and those were kind of the bands that got me into it and I actually kind of picked it up from there you know I just listened to those bands and I discovered more advanced and yeah we were just we actually became to to only metal hats in that entire school so yeah he was actually the kind of the guy that got me into metal hmm I mean that's that's very much how I got into a lot of ground music as well you know just kind of meeting somebody in school who was who was already into it yeah I I remember in high school I was I was very much into a lot of the new metal music that was being played on the radio but this this friend of mine had turned me on to punk music and then it just kind of went downhill from there and and then and then sort of after kind of realizing a twitch which you had already realized like oh hey you know there's this kind of obscure cool underground form of music yeah that I hadn't heard of before and it's kind of opened this new world to me and it sort of turned me on to this idea that well you know maybe there are other sorts of underground genres as well right kind of I guess exhausted the punk Avenue back and listen to metal and I went back and listened to a lot of different genres of music sort of learning more about jazz and hip-hop and different forms of popular music so you know since then I imagine a you know as a kid you'd be saving up money for for what cassettes and yeah CDs and and so so in your collection which I know is really huge and you've shown it many times and in your videos I mean some of those earliest cassettes and CDs that you bought yeah we're younger and sort of first getting into the genre do you still have a lot of that stuff now actually well the tapes I I got rid of the tapes when the CDs came out and I still regret it until this day because you know oh yeah these days some tapes are even like a worth a lot of money and but that's the thing you know when you yeah when you're getting into that stuff when you're a kid you just don't know how much you're gonna value it when you're older no I mean there's so many CDs that I had when I was younger which I had now well I never sold any cities actually I mean I've been actively collecting for the last ten years and before that I just you know every once in a while but myself City but I remember that I well I still have a couple of CDs that I bought back then which are a lot of money worth right now and I remember when I just took to see a lot of my CD player and threw it on the bed and if I would see somebody do that now you know just tear his head off like what are you doing that's so much worth you know and what do you think back you go like this really took a weird turn you know because some albums I bought for like one or two euros or a couple of dollars in your case and they're worth a couple of hundred now and yeah I I never sold any CD's but yeah it's a shame that I didn't kept the tapes although I don't have a tape player actually but I still do have a few tapes that I bought well recently actually I recently got the first demo tape from the Maltese band beheaded and now that I have a tape player but I was like you know I have every CD so why not tape to get my collection complete but it's not something that I buy a whole lot actually I just stick with vinyl and so these for the most parts you know what you just said they're about that Maltese band kind of leads me to my next question if there's another thing that kind of grabs me about metal music and just especially in the Internet age it's that it feels like the community has just kind of a very international sense of self yeah a lot of the metal press even in the US consistently champions bands from other countries whereas in the American music press when it comes to pop music or hip-hop or in an indie rock it seems very Western centric and is rarely if ever kind of reaching outside of the borders of the US and Canada or just the english-speaking European nations okay um and I wanted to know if you kind of feel that same way I mean I find it interesting that we have a band like like ghost for example yeah being is as big and as successful as they are with American audiences despite the fact that they're not from the West now it's rare that we have artists with an indie pop for example sort of hitting it as big at least these days yeah well I think that metal hats often like to share promote some more unknown and underground stuff with each other I mean I've promoted a lot of bands up till now and I like to venture out to different kinds of countries I recently made a video which was called Jim toons there was the music that I have on my phone which I take to the gym and I actually went around the world to a couple of countries like Iceland and Poland and I think that it shows how passionate people are to make metal in the first place because I even have a band which is called our Samus if I pronounced that correctly which is if I'm not mistaken from Iran and you know some of those countries have like the death penalty if they catch you by metaphor making metal and still those guys kind of risk their lives to create metal and even good mental and that is something which a lot of those guys like to do is like okay you know we know the big guys like suffocation and emulation from from the USA and then you have a couple of big bands from the Netherlands aspects a sinister and whatnot and I see that more and more people like yeah but have you heard about this band from South America or from India or from China and it's yeah a lot of people like to venture out next to all this stuff that we already know and I think that's a really good thing actually because in that way the more unknown bands and the smaller countries that are not really known for their metal also get a chance to spread their music because there are some really really good stuff out there as far as a you know a lot of these metal music websites that may be covering artists from outside of the US even though the the websites are us-based you know given that you are you know in Europe is is there anything that you know you could tell us on the outside that you think that we're missing that is sort of really great over there that isn't quite making it over the ocean to over you mean in a kind of music way or yeah like it like it like in a music sense sort of any any recent bands or albums that maybe have dropped this year or stuff that you think is older and kind of has has not been celebrated as much as you think it should have been well I think that when you see the list that people are making of the best bands of this year and I'm also making a list people tend to stick to the more known stuff that get more publicity and I'm always trying to find the more obscure the more unknown stuff there's a lot of great old school death metal coming out these days for example my number one for this year is still the German band sulphur aiong with their new album and i recently got a new album from the band lost soul and which is from poland and a lot of people tend to well point out to the bigger bands when it comes to a certain country like when it comes to poland they point out behemoth or vinegar or capitated and i think there's so much more to that if you just search a little bit better than you know you can get some really great bands that create some awesome music and i really like the fact that a lot of labels are releasing the older albums that have been produced in the beginning of the 90s there's a Dutch label which is called Vic records that has been releasing the first album of obscenity supplicated truth which is impossible to find these days if you want to have the original and then there's for security from the band's calls carbonized which he has been releasing and I think that's a good thing because there's a lot of bootleg stuff going around with cities like that and yeah I think that's one of the things that ya can't be spread enough when it comes to new releases but also the older releases of certain labels you know the older stuff I mean there's some great new stuff coming out of course the new Niall is just awesome and a new Cataclysm but those are the bands we all know and I think that that's the whole point of my channel to point out these smaller guys you know just like the Dutch band body farm has been releasing a new album and yeah I think those guys deserve a bigger chance were not really a bigger chance but more publicity than the the big guys that get it anyway so yeah that's yeah I mean it's I I think isn't it's pretty interesting that that sort of these reissues are coming out to kind of give people a chance to hear these really obscure albums that yeah yeah one time we're just kind of only on tape or bootleg yeah it's it's definitely important to appreciate that a lot of these forms of extreme metal that came out in the 90s I mean they wouldn't be where they are now if they had not started sort of on that bootleg tape circuit yeah back in the day because that was the way a lot of these genres were spreading because as in as I guess inclusive as the metal community is now two different styles of metal uh when thrash metal kind of reigned supreme death metal and black metal didn't exactly have an easy start a lot of people didn't exactly get it yeah I mean that's that's something I hear a lot of these days as well when they're actual bands coming out with a similar sound from one of the earlier bands I don't know if you heard about the album savage land from the band gruesome which is kind of like a lot of people call it a death tribute band and it has like the almost the exact same sound as leprosy from from death and a lot of people were disappointed by it because they said like yeah it could be another band another album of the band death and I think to myself but I don't see anything wrong with that because death is no more and what's wrong with a couple of guys carrying the flag carrying that sound and just to let people again experience the wealth to me just great sound of the old school death metal sound as it was back then and yeah I just I think that a lot of people should be a little bit more open-minded when it comes to you know certain certain bands that release something new there are a lot of guys that want to play some old school stuff and there's a lot of great stuff coming out but yeah people tend to be a little bit close - stick to the stuff that they know and yeah are a little bit afraid to venture out outside of the stuff that they know and yeah that's a little bit of shame actually yeah it's it's it's an interesting point and that was definitely one of the things I was gonna ask you your thoughts generally on some of these newer groups that aren't necessarily tribute groups yeah but but bands that are making new music but it sounds exactly like the old stuff it sounds like now that metal has reached a certain age where you know you have decade upon decade upon decade of metal in the past to kind of reflect upon you have people going back and kind of reviving these older sounds yeah yeah I mean there's there's a band called Ruth and a band morphing and people are kind of complaining like it doesn't bring anything new but I I personally think that you can evolve in a kind of music up to a certain point I mean what more do you want to change to the music to be special and to be new I just think that there are guys out there that want to create music and even when it sounds similar to what has already been done I don't really see a big problem with that you know I mean you don't have to like it of course if you don't like the genre at all but you know I think that if you try to change it so much and try to be yes special or or try to be new you get stuff like bands such as rings of Saturn which to me is really not my kind of music with with all the technical stuff in there which goes way over the top for me and yeah it's kind of like yeah I I have to I have to totally agree with you I mean I personally cannot sit through a rings of Saturn record either no I mean I put up one song and after 10 seconds I'm like Jesus Christ wait you know this is like a Nintendo 8-bit on on speed or something like that yeah I'm just I'm like what the hell and I mean it's great people love it you know there are big fans out there off of that genre and of that kind of music but I'm like I like to stick to the old sound and you reviewed an album which towards the megalith of this month and yeah you know which is I know you're a big fan of that record to you yeah I mean I got like three times the vinyl and the city itself you know I I mean it's just a crushing album and this but if you look at the aspect of is it something really really new well no but it still makes it a great great album and people always want to have new stuff you know it's not anything new well no but it's still a great album you know I mean yeah and it's the same for Advance when they bring out the new album they always have to for some reason that they have to top their previous album which I think like now if they just keep on going with the sound that I like they can make 10 albums with the same sound they don't always have to top it and they don't always have need to change as long as they make it good I'm happy so yeah do you think the Internet age is maybe metal fans and just music fans just in general like maybe made them a little impatient and kind of you know always always waiting always kind of on the edges of their seat for that next new sound and for somebody to kind of push things forward a little bit oh yeah I mean people on the internet are impatient anyway I mean when when I upload a new video two days later I get messages like okay so what's the next video I'm like Jesus Christ give me a break No and yeah a lot of people rather complain instead of wait because I think that if a band takes his time or it's time to create an album the more time they take you know the better it can become but I think people are bored really quick they listen to new they've listened it to a few times and they start bugging the band when the new album is gonna come out you know I mean it's you have such a great access to all kinds of music and they're where you had to wait for an album to come out and you could only read it in a magazine you went to the store and you picked up the album and you shared it with your friends like hey there's new album out and you know that was the thing for at least a couple of months but now people listen to the album before it's even out and they get bored with it before it's out you know so yeah I think it's it's it's a great thing the Internet but it makes people impatient and quickly bored so that's a little bit of shame actually yeah talking about some of these newer bands that are playing with older sounds I mean simultaneously the Internet has also allowed for a lot of groups that I think probably would have fallen into obscurity eventually even though they had some successful records in the past it kind of continued putting out albums and and you've already said that you know you don't mind and you actually like the idea that there are bands out there that are sort of you know reliving the sounds of like deaths leprosy yeah but you know are you personally like looking forward to when let's say Cannibal Corpse or autopsy come out with a new record oh I absolutely do there are many people that stick with the older albums of a certain band I've seen comments of people commenting on the new album of chemical corpse or the most recent one the skeletal domain and then people are like it's something so different compared to eating back live and I'm like yeah of course you know these people get older and they want to innovate just a little bit so yeah it's of course it's different but I look at each album separately I mean yesterday there was a guy asking me do you still hate the black dahlia murder and I was like I never hate a band there's just a chance that I don't like their music and the first few albums off the Black Dahlia Murder were really not my thing and then I listened to Everlast and I was like okay this is really not bad but yeah even when the great guys like autopsy and emulation and Cannibal Corpse come out with anyway album work Parker's with the circle steel I really really like to listen to the album but I'm someone need that waits until it's out and gets myself a city or a vinyl I might listen to one song online just get an idea of what they've been making and if I like it I'll just get the album but yeah even the bigger ones are still on my list yeah your your old school oh yeah yes it guest you know I I kind of had a moment like that the other day where it was kind of odd with and you know I I hate to bring this up in the middle of a discussion about metal but the new Adele album how her and how her and her label decided that they were not going to be doing any streaming no early leaks or anything like that okay to buy the record and when it comes out it comes out and it was like hey you know I haven't had to wait for an album to actually come out for a while now and it's it's just kind of weird and it's just so funny to sort of see people who have sort of grown up never having known that yeah sort of reacting to in a very negative way yeah I mean you know a lot of people are being used to or are yeah they are used to be able to listen to an album before it's even out and I'm like you know that for me spoils the whole surprise about an album of it's just like I said I'm just gonna listen to one song and then I get a really good idea of what they've been creating for this album and then I'll just buy it and I put myself cup of coffee and I sit back and I listen to the album and I'm like okay this is a really good shit and I think that brings a little bit back the magic of buying music you know if it's so easy accessible it kind of spoils that entire parts I remember when I was going to the record stores and I just picked out a pile of ten cities and I went to the counter and I just stood there for two three hours just listening to albums and you know it wasn't accessible on the Internet and that was just such a well charm charming way to listen music and to discover new music although it's great because you can share it with people like hey you know just listen to this still that parts going to the record store and to discover and to just be yeah to be busy with music like that that was my favorite part of listening to the music and and and the collecting part actually that's that's kind of the thing that internet has spoiled although it has its advantages you know so you can listen to a song but yeah I kind of Miss that actually yeah in a way it sort of spoils the the communal aspect of of releases as well because albums coming out feel less and less like events yeah since there are so many albums coming out one after another and everybody kind of just listening to the record at their leisure sort of just illegally downloading it off the internet something it just kind of feels like very isolated yeah I mean you know I've I've been talking to people and asking them like hey yeah are you gonna wait for the new Cannibal Corpse or are you gonna wait for a new valve Gore and they're like well I already listened to it like what do you mean you already listened to it oh yeah yeah I downloaded it somewhere and they wanted to send me the link I was like I don't need to listen to it I just wait for a song to come online and then I'll listen to it then I'll just buy the album you know just to yeah to be waiting for something and to to have it as so as a kind of a surprise I mean if you've listened to the album and you get it in your hands you go like yeah well you know I already know this so it's it's I mean I I'd love to discover an album and to put it on and to go through the booklet and to watch the artwork and yeah you know just to to have it us in the experience to listen to the album people just throw it on their iPod and don't really get into the music anymore you know it's kind of like a secondary thing like yeah we'll just download the album sounds good I've kind of throw it on my ipod and yeah I just from a hobby perspective I'm like I love to discover the music while I have it in my hands you know that's a lot I think it's a lot nicer to to be able to work with music like that going back to a point that you made sort of about rings of Saturn I mean this is this is something that I wanted to ask you about it seems like metal music in general is sort of a lot of the time based on some kind of extremity of some sort you know extreme technicality extreme brutality yeah do you feel like right now metal has kind of reached a bit of a threshold of extremity like obviously you know you personally have a taste threshold there they're albums that can get too technical yeah in your opinion but you know do you feel like we can really kind of push it past the point that we're at now or at least some of these bands are at now and if so you know is is pushing it past this point even really necessary is that going to advance the genre or make the music any better at this point I personally think that the the more they put all the technicality in there the more boring it becomes you know it's kind of like a contest who has the more technical stuff in their music and I also think that that is the reason why a lot of guys out there are kind of fed up with it because that's kind of how it looks and one to create that old sound again I do like some technical death metal every once in a while like nikrif I guess I got their two albums and there's a band all fede and I from Iceland which is pretty technical but they don't overdo it and I'm like no if you keep it on like this it's fine but I bands such as d2 flesh who were well just brutal death metal in the beginning of their days their latest album portal to Canon was just really over the top for me and I was like oh Jesus Christ you know not one of those bands again no they were just so good and then they evolved this guitar wanker shit and I was like now this is just and I think if they push it even further it's getting worse actually so yeah that's why I like the the old sound being relived through the guys that are creating it so you you like some of these older sounds but also what's your take on some of these groups because obviously some people have reacted to this extreme technicality by going back to the old school but some people have reacted to it by experimenting more with sound than sort of technical ability and there's kind of musicality experimenting with noise and electronics and and stuff like that like bands such as altar of plagues for example okay or even or even the band Indian and there are a lot of other groups that that are sort of slipping my mind at the moment sort of what's your take on going down that direction some of these newer black metal acts as well kind of really experimenting with noise and just kind of working on making their music more abrasive more textured you know and kind of acting away from just simply having guitars be the the star of the show yeah what I do like with bands like that is that bands such as flesh God apocalypse that asks a lot of classical music in there and well you're either a fan of it or you're just really hated there are a lot of people that just don't like classical music and they even put more classical music in their most recent albums and there were a few people that said like well you know they get to classical there's also a release from a balance cult neo LIF and I can't pronounce the name because it's just in a sort of different alien language they also use sound effects and and voices like opera voices in there which to me adds a great atmosphere to the metal which is already really atmospheric and dark I do like that kind of stuff actually I think that if they experience work experiment mint with it and it creates something which creates a great atmosphere just like the project of the guys from Cataclysm which is called xvo which has kind of like a Roman atmosphere because it's also about the old Roman Empire Nile for example you know it's it's really fucked up extreme and still you hear these ancient Egypt sounds in there which to me is just great but that's if they create a great project with that and it sounds good then I'm a really big fan of that Oh have you heard it this is just kind of a bit of a detour have you heard the band sigh have you listened to sighs no this Japanese metal band and okay they're they're kind of very wacky technical and left-field like the band rings of Saturn that the vocals are even more off-the-wall and I and I find them hard to listen to as well but the thing is sometimes you hear that stuff and it's it's not so much it's it's technical you know it's also very experimental and nothing that you would expect okay and and as much as I don't like it I just have to kind of nod my head at it and be like yeah this is this is crazy this is the craziest shit I've ever heard today yeah III think that I mean III also have been a lot younger and when I listen to metal it had to sound like metal you know you had to share half the original sound the drums and the growling and the guitar riffs and you know when when I got older I was like well when I was younger and I listened to something that was completely different or the guys that were experimenting I was like ah this is crap after like 2 to 3 seconds and I'm more these days like okay I'm just gonna listen to it I'm just gonna let it you know sink in and I'm just gonna give it a chance and that is how I discovered a lot of bands which at first I was like okay this is really crappy and then I gave it another chance and another chance and I was like okay this actually really really good that's one of the the most known examples was actually Rammstein and when I first heard it I was like you know those those German German vocals and German lyrics I was like yeah fuck this shit I don't speak German I I hardly understand it so yeah let's not and I mean I now have three or four cities from them and I think they're really good I seen in life three times so yeah I like to give it a chance more because if you don't you're gonna ya miss a lot of great stuff out there I I used to listen to Trypticon in the beginning and I was like Jesus Christ what is this and I now have both their albums you know I just gave it another chance and I was like okay let's just really listen to what they're what these guys are doing and then you just find out that it's just awesome and great genius stuff I just love trypticon them now yeah yeah a lot of there were a lot of metal records that were incredibly popular on the radio over here during the late 90s in the 2000 yeah when I was younger I got into them I had the CDs but as I grew older I just sort of assumed that yeah I'm not really into this anymore this isn't what I'm listening to anymore yeah there's no way that this is still going to appeal to me but going back to a lot of those records there are at least some of them that I still think are great on our good albums and Rammstein is definitely one of those bands I'm also Pantera Metallica as well of course but you know they're kind of Metallica sort of reached this almost classic rock statuses point it's it's like they've kind of crossed over you know and just kind of general rock fans love the hell out of them I also to this day I still kind of swear by I think System of a Down had some great music especially when they first came out and what's what's another band that uh oh I love Rage Against the Machine as well they're kind of a blend of different stuff oh yeah Rock shine is definitely one of those bands that looking back on them even though they might have seen kind of like maybe like a bit of a one-hit wonder - some people I mean I caught them live - and I think you know a lot of their early stuff is great yeah I mean I reasonably posted a picture on my Instagram of the slip box of these that I have oh yeah and just to mess with people a little bit I mean I still like the music it is one of the bands that I've well discovered like years ago and every once in a while I put on a CD and I'm like no I still remember why I like this and I still do and a lot of people tend to this out the stuff that they started with you know I say it's shameful to still listen to the stuff that you started out with there are people that say like well you know I started off with IRA made him but I listened to Cannibal Corpse these days and I'm like no I still have Iron Maiden probably every CD by now but yeah I think it's it's great to look back at the bands and the albums that you started out with such as venom and some people like yeah well then he'll never we're really good and of course it wasn't really technical or brutal in any way but yeah they started out with a certain atmosphere and certainly ryx and yeah I think it's it's great to step back a little bit every once in a while into your memory I think like okay hey this is what I've not been listening to for quite a while so and I just wanted to see the reaction of people because of course they've not has this yeah how do you say that's it's kind of like a status people love them more people absolutely fucking hate them and there were a few reactions that were like you and Slipknot why and I was like well because they make music which I do like and people are making it so difficult and and and making so much trouble out of music and I'm like you know just let people listen to what they like to listen to you and you know everybody has bands that other people don't like but yeah I'm you know some people are ashamed to to admit that they've listened to certain bands I recently posted a picture of an album which I have of Bob Marley and people like whoa Marley really I'm like yeah yeah I'm good music is good music so it doesn't matter when you bought it that when you were listening to it it's it's still a part of you and that's what you started out with yeah I mean I used to love the shit out of Slipknot when I was a kid yeah and I I think some people might and I know that there are some metalheads that listen to them as well when they were popular and they and they still they still stick by him yeah at least some at least some of the older stuff and they stand you know I hear they still perform really well yeah but I think I'm I think some people sort of I don't know wince or or sort of reel back when they hear a name like Slipknot I hear that somebody is listening to Slipknot because to them it's probably reflective of a time when they didn't know as much about metal as they knew now yeah because when I was a younger I mean there was certainly a point in time when I heard Slipknot where I was like this is the most brutal shit I've ever heard there was a time when I thought fucking six feet under was like the most brutal death metal band ever you know but I mean later down the road you hear other artists and you hear other records and you learn that that's not the case at all and and I think some people I don't know I think some people feel lied to when that sort of happens and as a result they're like oh I don't listen to this I'm not shit anymore it's I found harder more brutal stuff yeah I found the real shit whereas like no it's it's still not that bad as in terms of metal music no I mean it's ssfh I even made a video about this pretty while ago which a lot of people misunderstood completely I met an old friends in the streets and we started talking and he was really deep into metal when we were hanging around and we were in our midst mates of 20s and I started out well I was already a metalhead and then he started to listen to it and it was a big fan of Metallica all of the sudden and he changed his entire look into a metal look and I was like you know that's not you but if that's what you want to do then go ahead and I met him and he was walking around in a three-piece suit and short hair and everything and which is a choice he makes I mean that's just fine I mean you know we all get jobs and we go get different people we hang around with but I asked him do you still listen to metal and which might be a strange question because do you still listen to metal but I kind of knew the answer that I was getting and he told me now that's something you do when you're younger and I was standing there in my thirties with my Cannibal Corpse shirt on I was like all right hmm sure I don't know and I was like okay you know your your taste evolves and it's changers and you get other music to listen to you I I recently well a couple of months ago I bought an album the first album of Daft Punk which I just think it's an awesome album and hope you're trying to homework yeah homework yeah yeah it's a great record yeah and and you know you change and your taste changes but I can't imagine that if you're so into something and and you're such a fan and you buy records that for some reason you reach an age where you let all that stuff go and think to yourself well you know that was something I did when I was younger and I'm like well you don't have to be as passionate in it as everybody else or or as me but how does it change from standing in front of an concert with your horns up in to walking around in the three-piece suit and telling other people like yeah you know that's just uh it's a rebel kind of thing I'm like okay yeah yeah I think you know that sort of thing is kind of universal for a lot of music fans sounds like there's it's it seems like music is for a lot of people just merely an outlet for them during a certain time in their life yeah and then maybe when they don't need that outlet anymore they kind of grow out of music because they weren't really as much into the music as much as they were into the outlet it provided yeah and and the people who were really there for the music from the beginning kind of stick with it into older age yeah I mean I always said like the older I get the more passionate like that about it's actually sure I mean just like I said in the beginning when I started out with metal I bought the shirts and I bought my army boots and our army pants and I every once in a while bought a CD and nowadays I just buy like as many as I can and that's how my CD collection grew up to be the size that it is now I think the last five six years has have been actually the most passionate when it comes to buying music and to listen to music of course when I started with my youtube channel I actually didn't started it to review bands or to I don't know to really talk about the music I just wanted to make a video and to just to show off some cities that I bought and then some people were giving me feedback like hey why don't you do a CD review and so yeah I think that just like you say for some people it's it's kind of like a face thing as in I need this right now but I don't need it anymore but yeah I also kind of like think to myself it's it's kind of a taste and you know you don't have to let it go but yeah it's it's strange how it changes for some people yeah it's hard to explain but it's alright oh yeah okay a couple more questions to close out I want to ask you you know as the longtime metal fan you are sort of talking earlier about what records and what artists you started with often I get the question you know where exactly should I start with metal music because to an outsider yeah it can it can be daunting or sort of I guess you know maybe even scary to somebody when they're trying to get into a new band and that new band has 30 records or so ya know where which which one do I even think first and and with metal to an outsider I assume it could probably be even scarier especially if you know your your first venturing into some of that harder more aggressive stuff and and and some of that stuff I mean even myself I didn't really appreciate it until exactly I knew where was coming from stylistically and yeah what bands were influencing those bands and then from there I could kind of gradually evolve into those harder records and see where those artists we're kind of getting their inspiration you know would you right off the bat recommend you starting with maybe some of these death metal bands these black metal bands or going back to the past and listening to your iron maidens and your Slayers and your Judas press and and all that well I get that question a lot from people they send me messages on Instagram and Facebook and in the comments on YouTube like they tell me like you know I'm in metal not for too long and I'm trying to venture out and to get into death metal and can you recommend me a few bands or albums and I mostly ask them like okay what have you already been discovering so far so I can get like a picture of what they're listening to and what they're liking and some people send me messages like you know I like rings of Saturn and and the the more technical stuff so then I just ask them like okay you know listen to this song like a very groovy song of bull thrower or block mortised which is more like old-school and then they send me a message back like holy shit these are some really good stuff and I like the D raspy and buzzsaw are qatar tones so then i can just pick it up from there and and tell them like okay so you know this is a band called Cannibal Corpse and this is more like this of course you can't answer everybody i mean i get like a ton of questions every day but every now and then i just sit behind my computer and i'm like okay let's see what this guy listens to you also like black metal and then they go like live therefore listen to black metal before and then i started off with immortal or some dark funeral or even Dimmu Borgir you know their earlier stuff and yeah you know it's it's great to be able to show people some extra music and to let them know about different kinds of genres there was this guy that kept on sending me messages like okay so now I like blackmetal too but how about some thrash metal and I just send them like five or six links of bands that have been making music in a pass-off thrash metal and a few new ones and I told him like you know you can really see the difference between the older stuff and the newer stuff and yeah I think like you know if it's if they already like metal then they should just tell you like okay I'll listen to this and a lot of these newer younger kids actually don't really like the older stuff like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest and venom and they just want to have the more extreme stuff which I think also comes a little bit from the attitude that it has you know it's it sounds brutal and it's you know they look angry and you know and they try to scare people with their looks and with their music and I think that they don't really find that with with the older stuff anymore which of course sounds like really light when you compare it to the newer bands I mean if you put on a era Maiden record or you put on a immolation record there's a huge different things sound and I think that I really want to express their their attitude like look at me being a badass metal hats in their music and I think that I don't really find that with their with their older stuff yeah the but you know it's it's definitely important to note that for it for its time it was brutal yeah but the thing is brutality has sort of changed over the years oh yeah and I guess that's sort of uh excuse me I guess that sort of leads me to to ask about sort of brutality about I guess shock yeah metal music which which has been a very important element to metal music as far as how people view it culturally of the years and do you think metal music these days I mean you you know you're talking earlier about how the way you dress the way you handle yourself people can sort of guess from a farm yeah are into metal music but do you think the general population is as shocked by metal as they used to be and and if they aren't is that shock value important to the existence of the genre does does metal music need shock to to be what it is I think the shock element separates the music from all the other music I think it's it's been played now of course you know I mean the said the whole Satanism thing and the horror thing but I think that it doesn't really need it but it's become a part of it you know I mean if you see a album art which is completely horrific I can imagine that in the beginning of the 80s and the the midst of the eighties people were like holy fucking shit and and album covers got bands bands got bands from from countries to play there and that has changed into mainstream people looking at it like yeah yeah yeah your guys are all saying is they all wear black right no we know it yeah it's it's it's another pile of corpses on our way yeah yeah so we just it all sounds like sheer that we know is you know and I don't really think that a lot of people are actually shocked by now I mean I I was wearing a beanie which had Dying Fetus put on it in the logo and there was an elderly woman I think she was around 60 and she was like hey what's wrong your beanie does it say like Dying Fetus and I was like yeah huh what's that I was like okay it's a it's a band you know it's okay like that noisy music I was like yeah that's it okay okay she just walked off and I just liked the page yeah you just you you you have never felt so unbridle yeah I was like all right you just you've got I just got shrugged off by a sweet little yeah I mean I remember when I was standing in a club I don't know how I wound up there oh I dunno I was a bouncer for a while and I was wearing a dark funeral shirt which said on the back only death is real and was this woman coming up to me she was like yeah do you know that that shirt of you is really offensive I was like and you know you get a little bit proud you go like ah here we go and she was like yeah you know I buried my sister like two three days ago and I was like yeah great this is a nice conversation to have in a club you know and I was like yeah I'm sorry and she was she was like why are you wearing such a shirt I was like well to have conversations like this I was like no I just like this kind of music and yeah you know it's just a phrase that they use and it's not to be taken best here is you know just don't get your pants in a twist and she just kept on going I was like okay I really did really need to get the fuck out of here because yeah you know this is just not cool but I mean if you're younger you kind of like those reactions from people like when they're really shocked and these days when I'm walking around that people like oh that's so offensive and it says Dying Fetus I'm like yeah cool you know yeah you know you had the discussions you had the arguments from people and you know what they're gonna say you know how they react and I'm like yeah yeah yeah you know just keep on walking so yeah I don't think that metal really needs it but it became a part that's unattached unattackable from from the music itself you know people just use it I think it's also kind of selling points because a lot of people do like the gruesome stuff that's been pictured on the albums and - yeah I express that attitude like it could be being brutal and I'm like yeah I had that period as well you know just I mean in a way it kind of keeps it kind of insulates the the music from the opinions of other people who would otherwise kind of just stay away from it because of because of that image yeah because as soon as they sort of they might not be shocked by it but the moment they see it they're like okay I have no interest in this yeah that's something I also sat in one of my older videos there's this top 2000 going on in the Netherlands right now it's around Christmas and they played like the most known 2000 songs on the radio and there are a few metal songs in that list that you can vote for it and when it gets the most votes then it's becoming then it's going to be aired on the radio and people are sending each other the links like yeah you should vote for hiram a danger to both for a Slayer and Metallica and I'm like let's not put it on the mainstream radio I mean not that people aren't allowed to listen to it or to enjoy it but yeah you kind of want to keep it for the people that genuinely appreciate it you know you don't I am please don't want to be standing next to a guy sipping from a Bacardi Breezer with a little dot on his head you know and and and and a little hipster beard or sipping from a Starbucks coffee you know while watching Cannibal Corpse and you go like okay yeah you know that kind of fucks up the atmosphere you know and yeah a lot of people want to spread it or or are kind of angry that metal is not being shown on television or it's not being aired on the radio and I'm like you know let's just keep it like that we never really need a television or a radio we spread the music amongst ourselves we gave each other tapes to listen to you and we told each other about new bands and about new albums and that's the way it always has been and I think that's the term of this genre actually that it's it gets spread by the actual fence and I think that that also makes people an actual fan because they really discovered it's not being thrown in their faces metal is never being used in advertisements or commercials and yeah in that way you really chance to experience your music as it is instead of being beaten down with it if you hear it like every ten seconds on the radio sure I think we're gonna I think we're gonna leave it at that again I want to thank ed Vater coming on I will drop his youtube channel down in the description you guys can check out his his vlogs his discussion topics about various metal bands but please do not ask him about cattle decapitate that will make him very angry and and you you probably won't like the answer that you get so just avoid all other you know just avoid that time I've been talking about that enough buying hours and still people ask me like what do you think of cattle decapitation I'm like Jesus Christ just watch this fucking videos you know it so but it's been my pleasure man I was really honored to you know ask for this so no problem yeah keep on making videos and I'll keep checking them out yeah for me man you 
5mBj9dN-8Po,backstreet's back alright hey everyone Anthony Pantano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ARCA album mutant arca is the pseudonym of one experimental electronic music producer this is his second full-length album you might remember him from some previous collaborations he has been tied to singers as such as kalila as well as FK twigs Bjork had some production on her latest album he also worked with Kanye West on some production on his yeezus album then shortly after he dropped a pretty perplexing but somewhat underwhelming full-length debut album titled Zen which was super abstract but maybe didn't spend enough time pulling me into the the very odd world that it seemed like this music was coming from but on this new album on the surface it would seem that that problem has been alleviated with the fact that this record is 20 minutes longer than its predecessor with more expansive track lengths more tracks and a few strange interludes spread out among 20 songs and there's not really that much more to talk about in terms of background with this thing which sort of makes sense in a way because Arcas music has always sounded like it comes from a weird context 'less void that doesn't have much in the way of connections to traditional or popular music and I think that's even more the case on this new record over here as many of the tracks on this thing drift further away from the elements of more conventional electronic music that showed up on Zen arca has replaced those elements of electronic dance music and hip hop and glitch hop with something that is just purely about sound play this record is vivid it is textural I think there are notes of Tim Hecker in this track listing I think there are notes of OneNote Rick's point never in this track listing but I think ARCA is going for something way more abstract kind of industrial flavored on some of these tracks and pretty experimental and challenging there are tons of shrill tones on this record fractured disconnected musical passages heavy powerful overwhelming percussion and bass chunks of noise brittle fuzz and distortion vast open never-ending atmospheres the music is a mix of frightening pretty and perplexing making it really hard to kind of settle into and kind of relax while listening to anything that ARCA is doing on this album the moment I think I'm starting to figure a track out arca sort of pulls me back toward the edge of my seat as he kind of turns into another direction introduces some weird abrasive new sounds or shattering moments of complete silence with stuttering basin and shrill loops on the title track to this thing eventually the song develops into something a little bit more easygoing and coherent with these slower prettier very smooth synth chords but even during its most subtle and nuanced moments this record is pretty unsettling even on the song vanity not one of the louder tracks and the track listing here it's loaded with these really shy explorative melodies but even here this melody it just sounds so whacked-out and hideous and not hideous and oh this is awful music type of hideous hideous in the way where I feel like I've paid admission to walk into some kind of musical freak show which makes the title of this record all the more fitting there are some songs on here that I don't remember for their musical qualities but for what they evoke in me image wise like the song sinner where I hear sense that sound like a police siren these really weird metallic noises that read like chain-link fences or dragged chains the song contrasts greatly to the track anger which has these fuzzy distorted loud synth leads that are swapping places constantly with these snippets of music could be samples of music that sounds like it could have come from Arcas home country of Venezuela and there are all these strange harps Kord ish cents on the song sever where it's like ARCA is purposefully placing a lot of sour notes into these chords but I can almost make out what the notes and the chords are supposed to be again it's like a listening to something purposefully miss shapen or mutated it's like the song is alive it's not this human created thing it's alive and it's trying to figure itself out or it is just thinking to itself why am i alive I've said a lot about these songs so far and I feel like I could say more but we're only 1/3 into the album's runtime thus far and that's how dense overwhelming and sometimes unpredictable this album can be and Arco doesn't exactly let up deeper into the album either I think it's pretty safe to say that people who merely know ARCA for the production that he's placed onto other people's albums might not enjoy what goes on here because this is nowhere near as accessible or pop-oriented as a lot of that stuff the music that ARCA does solo is way more indulgent and so much more about diving into a world where it seems like he doesn't have the opportunity to elsewhere he's not making songs again as much as he is erecting digital skyscrapers in a glitched out post-apocalyptic matrix though eventually arcus formula about halfway into the record does become a little more apparent as he continually blends these eerie very tiny miss shapen highs and mids with monstrous just completely unpredictable bass and percussion that just pops out like a serial killer and a slasher flick there are some songs in the middle of this record where it seems arca is taking a more conventional approach like on the song front load which feels like a fusion of Boards of Canada and effects twin it's very much an eidm oriented track I think the only track in the middle of the record that I was really grabbed by was most likely the song umbilical which is super noisy super cacophonous and very rhythmic as well and features these really stand out vocal samples oh there are a lot of moments deeper into this record that I think are inch reading I think are strange I'll give it that but I don't really have much in the way of a motion for it I guess when it gets to songs like gratitude in the song n I feel like we've transitioned from making really interesting experimental compositions to just delivering all these really indulgent exercises where no one single moment seems any more significant than the other which was partially an issue that I had on Arcas last album as well the cacophony eventually just sounds like a completely purposeless hodgepodge and I appreciate the challenge but even ARCA himself I think stops exploring this musical world he's established by the halfway point of the album and doesn't continue to introduce new sounds vibes and emotions into the recipe I thought this record was okay I think it is really out there it is pretty strange and I think if you want to be challenged I think if you want your mind bent a little bit try this thing out but beyond some of the inspiring sound design I don't really feel like there's anything with this album that's going to stick with me for the long term because a lot of the experiments on here while it's there definitely left-field they just kind of sound like I don't know just short-term thrills for me hopefully what ARCA has done on this record is a little more meaningful to you though I'm feeling a decent strong six on this

CfthjMEdEm8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is at this point and it's time for a review because that's what we do here on a regular basis a review of the new freddie gibbs mixtape shadow of a doubt Freddie Gibbs or Freddie Kane or Freddie Corleone is a Gary Indiana rapper and recently a father and he is a rapper that I've been somewhat indifferent to for a while that was until he dropped the album pinata where he wowed me with the help of legendary underground hip hop producer mad lib and I I did love the beats on this thing I actually loved the beats on this thing to death but it wasn't just the hazy kind of loaf I muffled vintage and jazzy instrumentals on this record that made pinata so good it was also the very focused topical thuggish but also kind of reflective lines bars and verses from Freddie Gibbs Freddie's work in the past has been kind of general and there are some people who are doubters going into this new project over here saying Freddie's not that great and this last project I mean could have been a fluke and I sort of understand but I think if Freddie brings that same focus verse writing into a new project over here I don't see why it couldn't be as good or just also great now we have 15 cuts on this thing a few bonus tracks a myriad of different producers across the tracklist but all the songs kind of have a pretty uniform sound the instrumentals on this thing are trapped flavored lots of sub bass lots of rattling high hats also they're very moody dark spacious atmospheric nocturnal the perfect soundtrack to slangin Kane on the corner at like 2:00 a.m. by the light of a street lamp the title of this project is incredibly fitting given how shadowy the production is and if there's another interesting change on this thing it's that Freddie is singing on quite a few of these tracks and the singing is not really that bad I wouldn't say it's amazing but it certainly got care duritz raspy it's a motive it's cracked at points it's it's not too off pitch or anything like that I think the only moment where the singing becomes unbearable is on the song basketball wives where Freddie in this very nasally voice is just redundant ly repeating this one melody soaked in auto-tune it is so uh but I like Freddie singing out of bulk of these other tracks like on the song careless and I like the singing on the song Mexico a lot too although that's that's a that's not Freddie if there's any other track on here I find major fault with it might be the closer just before the bonus tracks on here which to me was just kind of a bit of shallow savagery I thought lyrically Freddie simplified it just a little bit too much whereas I think you can really dive into a lot of what he's saying on many of these other tracks and on these other tracks Freddie's bringing the same dope boy lyricism that you would typically expect from him although I will say there are a few moments where it does feel general once again just like his previous material sort of like on the song narcos or forever in a day even the song McDuck even though it does have some very nice and melodic guest vocals on it sort of falls into the atmospheric murk that many of these other songs share but many of the other tracks on here are very focused very pointed very gritty very mean very in your face or they feature the kind of soul searching that you would expect from somebody who recently became a father sort of like on the very moody and melodic insecurities or on the grimy Freddie Gordy where Freddie Gibbs is kind of teetering between being a dope dealer but also a drug addict and he's kind of weighing his options and sort of reflecting on his daughter and having this baby has kind of put into light what's really important the song rearview is a hard-hitting and amazing start to the record where lyrically Freddie is kind of detailing the very dark road and paths that he has taken to kind of get to the point where he is now the song up the count the lead single from this record I loved it upon first listen and I loved it even more in the context of this record especially hearing all of these other dark eerie tracks the electric piano lead on this song is so wonderful and the lyrics on this thing are as sad as they are grimy and kind of circle around a fundamental of dope-dealing and that is not up the count there is a sample of dialog from the wire on this track which is nothing new for Freddie Gibbs he has shown the influence that show has had before on his art Freddie and black thought go toe-to-toe on the song extradite with some of the better verses on the entire record and a very nice fast nimble jazzy instrumental and I like the song ten times as well with E for T and Gucci Mane instrumental kind of brings a bay area sound on this one it's smooth it's sexy it's kind of sensual but it has that dark atmospheric tone that a lot of the other songs on this record do and lyrically Freddie in the gang they kind of go into a series of I guess I don't know relationships in quotation marks with a series of of women each rapper having that their own experience Freddie sort of talking about this girl in a sort of loving way but also she seems to kind of be a drug mule for him or something really crazy dark  and the song packages is a legit just hard-hitting banger rabbit at baggage it up rabbit at baggage it up seems little ASAP ferg influence especially with a very expressive cracked manic flow that he's delivering all over this track the hook is repetitive but irresistible and it's probably the the high-water mark of adrenaline on the entire tape overall I thought this thing was decent I didn't love it I think it certainly had its issues and a few low points but it was cool to just hear Freddie put together another very coherent project sticking with not only a number of themes lyrically but a pretty strong sound as well and he experimented with with the singing on this thing and for the most part it goes over well I'm feeling a decent strong seven on this thing Tran so god dishin have you given this thing a listen did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it I hope you're doing good Anthony Fantino Freddie Gibbs forever 
kBBMds9cP6Y,hi everyone no makeup here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Adele record 25 UK soul and pop singing sensation miss Adele with her long-awaited follow-up to her fantastic breakout album 21 came out about several years ago at this point the album saw unforeseen success and continued success as it went on to sell millions and millions and millions of copies and Adele and her label really squeezed every last drop out of this hype with some live material interviews and magazine covers but eventually Adele slinked away into the shadows to kind of live her life have a child and presumably create this new record now there was not a whole lot of PR hubbub leading up to the release of this new album over here we had a debut single hello with a music video and just like about a month later we're getting this record and I respect that I respect that lack of BS it says to me that del in her label in a way they trust the fans to try the record to listen to the record to have faith that the record will be good it'll be decent we don't need to be mercilessly teased to the release of the album just give us a track let us know that one's coming out for give us album but Adele and her label are also trusting music listeners to not stream this record because it is not on any streaming platforms it is only available for sale make that money so I myself bought this thing right away had to hear it and so let's get into the credits if you're at all familiar with some of the producers some of the coast songwriters on Adele's last record there are some familiar faces here like Ryan Tedder and Paul Epworth and we also see co-writing appearances from a lot of different artists like Tobias jesso jr. who seems to have been having a really great year Bruno Mars and even Greg Kurstin of the burden the B who has been writing more and more often with a myriad of different pop singers and we even have Max Martin making an appearance on this record who is behind the success of tons of different pop sensations of the 2000s really kind of reaching back into the past on that appearance a lot of the co-writers also have producer credits on this thing but one producer credit that stuck out to me was that Danger Mouse appears on this record which is is pretty crazy whatever I'm digressing let's just get into the music the song hello the lead single from this record actually kicks the album off and if you didn't know I already did a review of this track but in summation I thought the lyrics on the song were cool they definitely told an interesting story of heartbreak and kind of missing someone longing for someone I loved Adele's vocals I like the tune on this track but I think the ball was kind of dropped on the production side of things the instrumentation just seemed way too glamorous and glitzy it didn't really support Adele's vocals especially on the hook which I think could have just blossomed or exploded with a bit more intensity so honestly even though I didn't go into this album expecting any lack of vocal talent from Adele I was worried that the production might end up being subpar and the song send my love doesn't exactly alleviate this production problem there's some very hopeful piano chords on saying vocally Adele kills it the verses are emotional nuanced and just as memorable and catchy and sticky as the choruses where of course it's memorable but what really makes the choruses win for me is not just a really great melody but Adele's singing where she's really digging down and her voice gets a little raspy she's reaching into her upper range she's just digging into that vocal diamond mine and just throwing Jens up and I I think the lyrics might have you grabbing for a Kleenex or two if um you know you're missing that special someone a little later we have I'll be you remedy I love this track it's simple it's intimate vocals piano for an artist as tenly today's Adele you don't need much more it's a great ballad it's a great performance and in this simple instrumental setup Adele can really let loose vocally and show to the listener what it is that makes her unique and make sir interesting as an artist lyrically there are a lot of metaphors on this track in other tracks too that seemed like you know very tried and true from older pop and vocal and soul music stuff like singing about the rain and hearts being cut and the night and lights and and rivers sadly that organic fluid intimate feel to the instrumentation drifts away for another few tracks like on the song water under the bridge where I think it's a winning chorus I think the chorus is the only salvageable moment of this song but the instrumental we get this really tight galloping beat these diddling guitars that are just so tight it's almost militaristic and sucks the soul from the song entirely thankfully the song rivarly takes a bit of an older approach the instrumental here sounds like something just vintage just pulled down from New Orleans or something really nice organ on this track some twang guitars as well and as the song develops a really large and in charge string section it sounds like the whole thing is being performed at once in a huge grand concert hall or something and I can't really shake the idea that I'm getting a little bit of like a Stevie Nicks vibe from this track as well I think the song love and the dark is equally as powerful but it's really the subtle moments on this record that win me over the most like on the song million years ago which is this wonderful quiet sad and just so close vocal piece backed up with beautifully picked guitar it's like this very dimly lit just candlelit dance with depression or a dance with a broken heart the lyrics on this track detail a ton of regret coming from Adele and obsession with being with this person who she can't be with the song all I ask right after is equally is heartbreaking but what kind of uh I don't know it ruins the vibe of the record for me is really the closer which to me is a the combo breaker to the continual sadness of this album sweet devotion is very much an uplifting song and and not only does it kind of kill the mood the very sad mood a little bit but it's almost as if like I was saying earlier the songs have been building up a bit of a narrative or a story that I was slowly starting to piece together as the album was progressing but all of a sudden oh we're getting sweet devotion and things are things are cool now this track essentially smashes the sadness sand castle that's been built up to this point and it's like here's some feel-good emotions stick that in your pipe and smoke it I still like the record though I think it's a very good record in summation hear my thoughts it was enjoyable the vocals were great the songs for the most part were great as well there were some moments where I had my reservations with the production where it just felt a little bland a little flat a little too tight and commercial to really just let Adele's vocals do the work I don't think it's a disappointment or anything like that but it definitely does not surpass 21 but it feels to me that Adele didn't even really feel any sort of pressure to top 21 this record has tunes it has lyrics it has great performances it has fantastic singing it has musical and stylistic variety as well and I'm feeling a DS it's a strong seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Adele forever 
nL5cIxUHwG8,Denis your sellout you're not credible no more your air rule reviewer hey you hey everyone Anthony fan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new ty dolla sign record free TC mr. ty dolla sign is a 2014 double XL freshmen California artist singer-songwriter and this is his full-length commercial debut record and I wasn't really anticipating this record also I thought his inclusion in the double XL list was kind of confusing given that he's more of an R&B singer than he is a rapper but more and more rappers these days are also singing and blending rap music with pop with R&B so the distinction between singer and rapper every year is getting harder and harder to make and I will say that ty has some actual singing chops I think he is a talented singer but the music he's made up until this point has mostly registered to me is just very slick very commercial R&B music something I'm not typically interested and I'm usually intrigued by stuff that's just a little bit more left-field but when reading into the back story about this new record also looking at the very somber cover on this thing and finding out that this album is kind of in tribute to Ty's brother who is currently locked up and hearing that his brother is actually on the album and also seeing guest appearances from people like Kanye West Kendrick Lamar yg Fetty WAP I thought okay maybe ty is doing something interesting here and to a point I think he is I think ty is coming off much edgier than your average R&B singer on this record there is an appearance from our Kelly deep in the track listing here which i think is pretty telling it's kind of obvious that our Kelly is a pretty big influence on ty just not when it comes to the music and in his vocal style but he seems to be an R&B singer who is pretty misbehaved sort of a bad boy take the song credit for example where he is singing to this girl that he's in a relationship with telling her that he's never smoked at her mom's house he's never flirted with her homegirls as if you know that this is like the glue that holds their relationship together but despite the obvious flaws in this relationship there does seem to be real love and desire there between these two people there's a real obsession and a need to stay together and and I think some lines and lyrics in here that show some some genuine love and appreciation - and speaking of credit there is a sea of producers on this record all of whom make this record sound gorgeous there are wonderful nuanced bits of grand piano and strings as well as some guitar on here which sounds really sweet really rich really melodic and then there are like really modern trap flavored club bangers on here as well even a DJ mustard produced beat which you guys should know how that sounds at this point right right right right right there's a variety of influences all over this record sometimes all coming together on one single track like on the song whatever we're all at once we're hearing these rattling trap high hats some gospel style vocals and these really freaky raspy soulful falsetto vocals that seem like they're being pulled out of the Rick James Prinze kind of Al Green playbook but given the overabundance of tracks and features here in the track listing I did expect that I would run into some filler or at least some tracks that that were kind of throwaway and that is the case some of the songs and the track listing here just don't go left like on the song guard down which is one of my favorite tunes here I think at the core of this song there is a well-meaning song some great vocal melody some good lyrics about hope and keeping faith but the beat here has these really ear piercing chirps that I think really just ruined the vibe of the song and then we have a Kanye West appearance which is easily the most phoned in feature on the entire record and then all of a sudden P Diddy pops in to do a weird monologue it was old halfway into the one he did on meek Millz record why are we getting another now in the second half of the record we're getting all of these moody atmospheric syrupy trap flavored R&B tinged bangers with people like Wiz Khalifa and Fetty WAP which are just kind of mediocre they seem so mindless in comparison with so many of the stunning cuts in the first half of the album I think the closest tie comes to pulling together a good banger in the second half of this album is the song with Rae sremmurd and future the song blase but even this track is kind of ruined by the really redundant beat and tie already put together the best banger in the track listing here in the first half the song with E for T the song bring it out of me is this terrible EDM pop has the worst lyrics on the entire record it's it's kind of sad it's like the entire second half of this album is just trying to make up for lost ground by appealing to the lowest common denominator one track after another just because the first half of the album was so tasteful and personal emotional and moving sadly the r.kelly feature on the record is kind of underwhelming and with all of these guest singers on the second half of this album I mean I like Ty's singing but he doesn't have the most distinct voice on the Block and as a result I think he ends up sounding like a guest on his own tracks especially the ones where he's loading one rapper after another on here the only salvageable moment on the second half of this record was the last song which has beautiful shimmering jazzy instrumentation obviously Thundercat had a hand in making this instrumental and most importantly I think this song brings back the very personal vibe that makes the first half of this album so great now as far as the first half goes I think the whole album starts off with a stutter the song la which has these wonderful sharp background vocals ma there's a dramatic monologue at the start of this track some beautiful string sections and some great lyrics from Thai just about his personal life and just where he comes from Kendrick Lamar's verse on this track really sort of bring this home the the lyrical power of this song right after time and ages to pull together a club banger without throwing his class out of the window on the song save it does have a hard-hitting dancefloor friendly beat but the vocal work on top of it is really nice the tune on the song straight up is a little mundane but again the vocal work is good but tie really starts letting go on the song solid which is this really sharp guitar back track with this sweet little lick yeah you know it it I'm solid and anti comes through with a lot of swagger on this track a lot of character a lot of personality he's braggadocious he's got charisma and the singing is really wonderful too and I love the groovy little bass line that's tucked away behind the acoustic guitar even though there's no really loud booming drums on this track it's got a sweet groove to it and then we have the breathtakingly beautiful but also cold-hearted horses in the stable a song essentially about ty having women all over the country that are interested in him that he sleeps with he hooks up with them and his lyrics on this track are cold as hell saying things like you're just another woman and this is just another night and that very mean attitude contrasts to the beautiful music I mean the tune of this track is is gorgeous I mean I've been listening to it over and over and over I've been returning to this track again and again and again since I've heard this record I love this song it's one of my favorite songs of the year if you listen to any song off of this record listen to this god damned song please in the song know yo right after is almost an extension past this track because it's ty singing to a woman who obviously wants to be with him they slept together but ty isn't really taking her requests all that seriously because you know he's saying okay you think this is like way more serious than it really is I don't even know you like yeah I know I know we got together but I really know you and the instrumental on this track takes more modern Basie moody hip-hop flavored sound kind of reminds me of something that would land on the latest Travis Scott record and I'm liking these transitions it seems like on the first half of this album we're getting a completely different record than what's on the second half of this album the tracks seem sequenced in a very purposeful way the songs are great the lyrics seem a little more thoughtful and the songs miracle and whatever which pretty much end the first half of the record our emotional stunners here we've kind of been building up this story of Ty's brother being in jail you hear a lot of these vocal cuts of ty talking with his brother on the phone about music about the album about just life in general it seems like they have a really strong connection there's a serious element of just heart string pulling on these parts where ty is talking to his brother and then his brother appears on the song singing and the singing is great and I mean there is a little ambient noise around his voice so it sounds like it's it's not recorded in a studio or anything like that but it adds so much character to the song and to this album to have an appearance with this person on this record and the performances while the recording is rough they sound good I mean the the singing on this track is is better than some of the singing of dudes who are actually able to be in a studio and the song whatever it's just so goddamn powerful I mean ty really channels gospel music and and turns it into something that seems new and is just really heartbreaking and stunning and it's such a great it's such a jaw-dropping first half on some of these songs and it's sad that ty just kind of lets go of all the positive qualities of this album so far on the second half just to kind of churn out some really commercial club bangers I mean I would have loved this thing if it were just like an EP of the first half of this record because once whatever rolls by we start getting generic bangers subpar features subpar songs the the personality and the emotion and the intimacy of the first half the all these songs to kind of let you know who ty is as an artist they're just completely all out the window I love the first half of this record to death the second half of the record has some serious lows on it but a great deal of the songs are at least tolerable overall I like the album even though I feel like I'm really getting kind of two records here and tie himself I will certainly be looking out for whatever he does in the future but he's just capable of so much more than what he handed over on the second half of this record and the first half of the record proves that I'm feeling a decent two strong six on the same Tran oh yeah yishun have you given this record a listen if you did did you love it did you hate it and what would you rate it what should I review next and that's it Anthony Fantana ty dolla sign forever 
PlXuagqoP5I,you lost all credibility with me Anthony ever since you gave the beeps at zero zero out of ten it's not how bad album is it's great it's not a zero I didn't even give it a zero that's completely inaccurate that's not the score that I gave it this is the cow zone this is my safe space Anthony you can't tell me different things that I don't agree with in my faith faith hi everyone Antoine Phan Tuan here the Internet's busy Abed the and it's time for review of the new king gizzard and the wizard wizard album God has fun to say king gizzard in the lizard wizard paper-mache dream balloon king gizzard and the lizard wizard is a melvin i said it rock band they've been at it for a while dropping one scuzzy distorted psychedelic garage rock album after another however when it's come to their recent output they've been experimenting a little bit trying some different stuff they put out an album earlier this year titled quarters which consisted of these four ten-minute tracks which not only saw the band exploring some different genres the intro track here had some notes of Latin jazz on here which was pretty interesting and the other tracks of course dabbled in a bit of Psych pop which isn't anything new for them but the 10-minute long track lengths on this album caused the man to be kind of progressive and creative with their song structures and the band seems to be moving in another direction with this latest project over here they seem to have put down all electric instrumentation in favor of just acoustic instrumentation acoustic guitars upright bass some drums clarinet flute fiddle harmonica piano and they use all this acoustic instrumentation to compose 12 very tight tracks the band writes peppy folk tunes very light melodic pop psych a little bluesy garage rock that has a lot of instrumental layers to it since there's no blaring guitars and the mix drowning anything else out and as a result the instrumentation on this project is pretty layered and intra the instrumentation isn't heavy in any way really so the band had to get really creative with how they layered and harmonized some of this instrumentation to make these songs sound thick dense wonderful and fun it's funky but freaky its psych but it's poppy it kind of reminds me of artists like Devendra Banhart maybe a little bit of Montreal and the elephant six collective a touch of Sufjan Stevens and the performances and the sessions on this record are actually really organic and in fluid and in the moment it sounds like all of this was recorded all at once with very minimal overdubbing which is really nice there are a lot of sweet catchy guitar licks on this record very upbeat drum beats some sweet flute leads the band packs a lot into these songs despite only several of them passing the 3-minute mark and most of them don't even feel underdeveloped it's interesting just how full two minutes of music can feel when it sounds like every second of it has been labored over because even though these songs are short king gizzard went into them with very defined and short and to the point intros verses choruses bridges and endings aside from the acoustic instrumentation it doesn't really seem like there's anything pulling all of these tracks together the matically so you can really kind of take each track here as a fun little folky bite-sized tune and there are quite a few highlights on here like the intro sense which features this really sexy sweet sensual clarinet lead and a really nice acoustic guitar lick some swaying chords that just switch back and forth between one another very passionately and beautifully and as sweet as the instrumentation is on this track and pretty much consistently throughout the entire album the vocals have this kind of a high-pitched intimate close and your face weirdo quality to them that as nice as this album is it kind of knocks the mood off kilter and just makes it feel a little fringe a little left-field however I will say these very close hi pitched vocals do have the tendency to kind of fall in the background after a little while they don't command as much attention as I would have liked them to which is sad because some of the vocal harmonies and vocal melodies on here are pretty good and there are a few tracks on the back end where it kind of seems like the vocal style switch up and the band tries to bring a bit of a narrative or make some kind of point or deliver some kind of message and the vocals just don't really have the power to bring it home and just kind of overtake the instrumentation and really say something still the vocals are enough to take tracks like bone and cold cadaver and just put a bit of a morbid vibe underneath the very sweet instrumentation on these tracks their songs on here that are very whimsical and have kind of a ballad approach like the song dirt which sounds like a very beautiful Pleasant acoustic dream waking up well-rested without a care in the world and the flute led instrumental outro on this track is really nice too but there is the song trapdoor which is incredibly dark incredibly moody I love the off-kilter refrain on this track trap trap trap trap trap though it's dark and it has all these phantom noises hanging in the background it's an eerie freaky little track reminds me of the black lips a little bit I'm reminded of the Black Lips again on the song ngr I which has this fun just very persistent piano chord playing throughout much of the track the band even though these instrumentals are intricate and have a lot of musical flavor to them a lot of them just have these consistent little simple qualities to them that make it instantly catching just really propel the track and make the instrumentation feel energetic and even though I am reminded of bands like Black Lips or even woods on this record occasionally I do think that King gizzard their instrumentation their instrumental chops on this album are just enough to kind of set them apart and make this album feel sort of special but I wouldn't say that completely overshadows the handful of spots on here where maybe the band sounds a little bit too much like their contemporaries or they're really just dish out some garage rock or psyche rock cliches on a bland track sort of like on the song bitter boogie but aside from that I think this is a really good fun album and if you are into folk rock psych Rock garage rock but with a kind of melodic edge to it and a lot of dynamics a lot of musical flavor not so much aggressive but instead nuanced then I think this album is worth a listen I'm feeling a decent of strong seven on this thing transition have you given ooh this record listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next that's it antwuan fan twon annobón house wolf the miraculous forever 
Aj7zSILtOYg,and then again review this again okay ten review will again okay hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new annobón house wolf album the miraculous swedish singer songwriter and organist composer miss anna von house wolf this is her latest full-length album which is following up 2012's hidden gem ceremony a record that I was highly anticipating at the time of its release however it didn't really end up wow me on this record you will hear mostly lonesome dramatic vocals cutting through beds of organ drones it's simple but only sometimes effective however I saw enough potential here to the point where I would be excited for whatever anna was going to be doing in the future I was excited for this new record over here and I'm happy to say that this new record over here is much bigger it's a much larger album it expands past the droney somewhat dream poppy sounds of her last record some inspiration coming from genres such as progressive rock and even a little bit of metal a touch of post rock to kind of like on the Swans and Godspeed end of that spectrum now of course the organs and Anna's vocals are still very much a focal point on these songs on this record Anna's vocals are very haunting they are expressive and the backing musicians here provide some pretty versatile and dynamic tracks for Anna to sing over between the drums and the organ and the bass here there are mountains of low frequency on this name as well as some gorgeous sweet and tender highs and the recording here is really organic it's really intimate it sounds very live and in the moment and fluid it's almost as if the whole thing was recorded in a church right then and there with no or very minimal overdubbing which might in fact be the case because it sounds like anna is again playing a large old-school organ and it's not like you could just pick that up and take it somewhere else now prior to the release of this record I thought and his singing was pretty but their moments on here on this new album where I think it is turned electrifying especially as she's reaching up into her higher range on tracks like come wander with me however this is one of only a few longer tracks on the record that I really like and there are other spots on here that I'm not all that impressed by this album has a really odd flow to it we have three songs here which are longer and all together add up to about three fifths of the album's runtime we're talking songs that are roughly about 10 minutes each and on these songs this is where the album's greatest most epic and most ambitious statements lie like on the mostly instrumental song discovery which has this hard rocking and progressive intro vocals actually don't show up in this track until about the seven minute mark and everything up until that point is propelled by this building fast just high-octane rock instrumentation it's it's really great and then an ominous drone follows and it gets really heavy it gets really dense it's like listening to the soundtrack of an army prepping for the battle to end all battles the song come wander with me is equally huge and and a lot of the time showcases Anna's voice wandering through this incredibly vast and open drone created by the backing instrumentation eventually the song erupts into these really sinister guitar and drum passages which are amazingly dark it's like all of a sudden the band has shifted into something that resembles that of like an old-school doom metal track there are guitar licks on this album that feel like they are pulled right out of the Tony Iommi playbook and the title track of this album is actually a very hypnotic beautiful and kind of long winded drone a bulk of the other songs on this album however are nowhere near as long they don't feel anywhere near as developed and in comparison are almost like detours and just kind of inconsequential just like they're sort of killing time with these shorter tracks consistently we get abrupt endings and musical ideas that just aren't really as developed sort of like on the song and oath or on the song Tom Perry poza we're on this track we get these creepy gothic chords and these blissful organs on this track as well the lead vocals are stunning but eventually the track just evaporates into nothing or the hope only of empty men we have very weary vocals on this track the organs are beautiful hypnotic once again but the track evaporates into nothing Anna and her band they developed some cool musical ideas or they set a great mood but once that mood has been established they just don't take it anywhere beyond that initial development there are a few exceptions like the song evocation or The Closer here which is kind of like this spaghetti western themed dark little acoustic guitar backed ballad it's very dramatic it's very dark kind of reminds me of the doors a little bit in a way but aside from that I feel like so many other songs here could have gone longer but still the album is about 50 minutes long as is and it's just about nine tracks so with these three songs and those two other tracks that I think are quite good I did end up enjoying a bulk of the album here it's just that it's so painfully obvious that more length and more development to at least a couple of these tracks could have made this record better so there are some painfully loose ends in the track listing here unfortunately I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this thing transition have you given this record a listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next that's it Antoine Phan Tuan annobón house wolf the miraculous forever

Zach heart of we listen for you Fame not only the music website but you may remember Zach from one of many letters that he has written me over the years which I have posted up on social media where he's asked me if he can buy my website if if there's anywhere online where he can properly vet my videos for coarse language because he has kids at home and he doesn't want them to be exposed to anything unsavory what else have you written me a letter about over the over the years I absolutely forget man I you're not even keeping track of your own i black out and I wake up and then you post them on your on your Twitter go you break the letters in a blackout state the war the father someone got into my Google profile I guess like Google Circles or whatever huh you all be in circles is that a new platform that they have whatever I work for Google so check out Google Circles you need your help now um somebody emailed me like you're a bad father here's some parenting techniques you know you're too abrasive with your kids and you don't know me if you're listening this but I don't have kids a 31 year old lonely man so hmm so I just write you letters that's how I spend my time is there anything that us at the needle drop audience before we get into the conversation can do for you to help you be less lonely find that special someone maybe help you adopt a child it's too late Anthony it's all over it's all over for you well my whole thing with podcast we start really dark there's like we can only go up from here okay I guess though I'm gonna be really depressed you know so it's like I don't know you're not gonna end it after this podcast right no no no I like life too much I'm drinking my Starbucks coffee supporting the local thing is the red then red cotton yep yeah I actually find it very Christmassy personally I think it's too minimal you know to be a holiday cup I mean I don't mind them just making the cup red out of just a desire to make the cup red but I mean to me the holidays are more than just the red color do you think it's possible that they did this with through PR like because every Starbucks I've gone to I don't go to a lot of them but they've impact since that controversy mm-hmm like they knew that people would be pissed off over a minimalistic cup well even the Christians are coming out right now saying okay we're not really that upset about it there's like one dude you start a viral thing but like it instantly became like as soon as they released it was like Christians don't like this because there's a war on Christmas but no it was really talking like you can see through Twitter and Facebook usually when people are pissed off and they start debating but no way is really they were talking about how people were pissed off I wasn't seeing somebody pissed off people so whenever I see anything like that like oh maybe Starbucks kind of did all this that's because the news media when they talk about outrage these days they're just my internet outrage which is not the same thing as in real life outrage it's nowhere near as potent I find a lot of the time because people are often not outraged enough to actually go out and do anything about what they're outraged over they're only really outraged enough to bitch about it on Facebook or like click some kind of online petition or something or like a video from that guy who you just said his name is Josh Feuerstein who who had made that video the fat fred durst the fattest and the fat christian fred durst I sort of see him as are you fat shaming people cuz I'm nice I'm super politically correct so that color as you know this podcast is not a safe space so just know that it's not well make it some hand sanitizer real quick yeah get some hand sanitizer and then we'll start this up let's see a news report your talk about like outrage on your comment errs some of them are the most lovely people in the world mmm yeah next time you write a letter maybe we can just gauge the outrage over that letter and then do a news report on that well I think we tackle a lot of issues and this has been a great podcast I'll catch you later all right so moving on to what we initially had an idea for in this podcast we were having a conversation kind of a heated conversation I think you threw some curse words at me we were talking about pop team ism and I guess the idea of embracing and supporting and promoting pop culture through music websites and also outlets like mine versus kind of focusing on more underground stuff and then I believe that was the gist of our conversation wasn't it I was blackout drunk I think you're such a dick I'm sorry business over the phone yeah it was it was over the phone so I either write you a letter I'll call you when I'm drunk so okay thank you but remember I mean that's you basically said how I feel so yeah we're on the right page okay and and I think it's sort of boiled down to this word that we were talking about called pop team ism which to me is is this idea that pop music as far as the realm of music criticism is just as worth a fair shake as a lot of the supposedly artsy and underground and abstract and sort of underdog music you know the indie scene I guess you would call it if that's even a label that that people are using and is even really all that relevant anymore right and I think pop tune ISM just like the Starbucks controversy we just talked about this was a smart play by independent websites to be able to do the Clickbank post like Dre keeps a hamburger I say that all the time but like you know drink it's a salad Drake eats amber and Jay goes to a basketball game and the thing about it is pop them ism is like the anti indie basically the anti hip which is probably the the most maligned word out there right now like no one wants to be called a hipster it's the most like it's the most hated word and it's a word that's a catch-all for like everything it goes into fashion it goes into musical taste it's become such a huge umbrella that the word has absolutely no meaning anymore so what I think what they did these these excites is a minute pop them ISM to justify traffic basically because you can have I mean for your listeners who don't know if Anthony does a review of the new Arcade Fire all right listen let's pick a pop one let's say you did the Taylor Swift did that get you a lot of hits did you do television I didn't do the Taylor Swift if you had you probably know you mentioned Drake so you could just say Drake you know well I don't know much about Drake but let's say that you did a track review of hotline bling you're probably get millions of hits whereas if there's a kid in the basement about a really great experimental record and you put up review will call them Chet review the new Chet Broken Mirrors whatever sounds indie you get you would get no hits whatsoever yeah you would get the people who are listening to this podcast like you know like people who are listening to podcast right now they don't know me there are a fan of you but like this is not just clickbait this is like you're really gonna sit and listen these guys talk it takes a lot like you're trying to discover new things and I think pop divisible is a way that and I'm only talking will use pitchfork and mylanta talk about pitchfork on here yes completely allowed I don't know you mean you guys are rivals right like close competitor actually best friends best friends are you cutting this now yeah me and conde nast we're we're tight just just go on and it's not breaking my balls and just being handsome and a nose anyway like pitchfork became the next Rolling Stone because they became the authentic place to go get the naan and I'm like I say bullshit but like the naan pop stuff that you know Rolling Stone shifted to Britney Spears being on the cover you know remember that that transition that they made sure huh and they became I mean they're you know to be fair Rolling Stone has covered pop artists for years I mean you know even people like Michael Jackson have graced the cover well Michael Jackson is very different that's a whole different conversation but the point I know Rolling Stone has always at least somewhat catered to the pop stars of whatever era that they're functioning and you know Britney Spears is is just kind of a sign of the times of the 2000s you know when they were just kind of I think playing to those signs and sort of giving into those signs just as any reputable pop culture critic outlet should and I don't see pitchfork is sort of doing anything different but going forward what I'm saying is pitchfork filled a void of talking about music that the mainstream larger publications we're not talking about surely they did it well I know you had Chris not on here he was like the godfather of like 2000 early 2000s like it was good writing and they were talking about records that you know in my opinion will get into this this is kind of the crux of my argument is if I if I can find Drake any you know like it doesn't do it I can find Drake anywhere it is that making sense like I can be in Iowa City and I will know about Drake I can go pretty much you know like turn on the radio if I have a thirst for finding things but what interested me with pitchfork is they were talking about stuff that I never knew existed and I would never run into if it wasn't for their site so they got all these loyal fans like you're building loyal fans pretty differently though as kind of the authentic and that that words trouble something we can work through that later in the podcast but it was like the authentic place to go it was not like we're just going to write about stuff you already know we're going to educate you on the stuff you don't know and then pop them ISM allowed them to transition without giving up that authenticity because pop the miz' mizanin out like a credible badge of honor if you look at top 10 list it'll be like you know Death Grips joanna newsom and then Carly Rae Jasmine and it a list that doesn't have pop on it is kind of not cool anymore to a lot of people because and this is echoing I know I'm rambling I apologize don't Johnny here's the deal is listeners today the younger generation they don't want to be defined by a specific genre they can listen to Carly Rae Jasmine Drake and Death Grips and that's great I completely celebrate that what I don't celebrate is this idea that we're not talking about the problems of pop music because there are it's a completely different place it's a whole different game pop and independent I'm out like when you think of indie I'm not talking about Pixies how about independently made albums versus pop mainstream albums they're there there's millions of dollars behind one the other is made in the bedroom and we're treating them with the same gloves and that's that's a problem and that's my biggest problem populism is it's a catch-all without losing authenticity without addressing the problem and you get the hits okay sorry that made no sense no it made sense there are points you made and want to address them and I will sort of take them as such let me just write down one more thing because I don't want to forget it because you made a good point I want to respond to it because you made a lot of points because I let you talk a lot because if I don't step in front of you you talk your fucking ass off and I know that there's comments on video that you weren't interested enough so I rila yeah no I mean I was interested a lot which is why I just kind of let him go on and on and on even though there are some spots in retrospect where I wish I had stopped him well what I think I don't think it was about stopping it just he would make all these points and then you go yes okay next thing I'm not breaking your balls I'm just saying I think that's what I don't know you know I'm learning to interview okay you know that's part of this podcast it's some learning I want to do this learning to do this somewhat correctly okay to me pop team ism while okay in a sense it may have been or in a sense it is this excuse to cover pop music and sort of get the hits and expand the the reader base of a website simultaneously I think if you sort of pull you know that veil away and you observe what the Internet has done for indie music I mean it's meant a lot more exposure for artists like deer hunter Animal Collective Arcade Fire some of these sort of mid-level indie bands that that sure in a sense they're doing it independently but there's a network of label distributors and record labels and PR people like these people wouldn't have jobs if it weren't for pop team ISM sort of widening the viewer base widening the listener base for these artists because certainly while yeah there are people who have year-end lists they're listening to Carly Rae Jepsen they're listening to Death Grips the thing is these kinds of crossover listeners just weren't happening ten years ago you know now that the Internet is kind of the reason we're treating these records with the same gloves is because for for most people it's all coming from the same place you know it's all coming from the internet people who are just slightly older like you and I we're associating a lot of these indie acts not just with the bedroom but also just kind of a specific local place you know and and I can see why you know they're not playing arenas like Carly Rae Jepsen is but the Internet has sort of leveled the playing field in a lot of ways and I think uh I don't necessarily think that treating these records with the same gloves is totally unfair and and when you sort of use that terminology do you mean in terms of like critical gloves like we shouldn't be critiquing certain records as harshly as we are others okay so Lana Del Rey I think it should always be mentioned that she got signed to a major label three times and rebranded three times the big problem on Del Rey imp optimism is everyone with the sexist angle and said oh she changed her lives or she got collagen and that was like the big argument and that never bothered me because that's her own decision I don't really how she looks my biggest problem was she was handed over and over and rebranded almost like a commodity and not an artist well I mean I think people sort of gawk over physical appearance a lot but I mean you can't deny that you know the whole lips thing and not that it's the only thing anybody should focus on but that's certainly a part of the rebrand it sure but I mean like but they're the more disgusting thing it was like when she was 12 like she had Elton John's piano honor you know I'm just talking like she was handed a career over and over and over and then they backdoored it through the indie sites as the get you know they branded her as the gangster Nancy Sinatra I mean this whole thing was so obviously transparently manufactured and if she writes a great record even as a manufacturer pop star then great you know talk about it if you're a pop site where I have a problem is these sites that are supposed to be authentic shouldn't be writing about something that's manufactured okay so you're saying that okay so I I get your point there but still manufactured or not she's kind of become or at least when she first shake when when she first came out or when she first broke through I want to say when she first broke through she was kind of an unexpected pop culture at that time and I mean I was happy to review her record but of course I mean I I think the way that you should treat those situations is to give a negative review and point out those flaws if that negative those reasons to be negative and if those flaws are there I don't think just ignoring the the problem I I think I think avoiding to review such artists kind of ignores the problem I think you know doing a review and not being overly praiseful and just kind of forgiving when it comes to these flaws and this often this inauthenticity I think that just kind of ignores the issue you know doing a review doing that negative review in the case where I know that I did where I critiqued those problems I I think that's dealing with the issue and pointing it out let's go back to intention if Perez Hilton writes about Lana Del Rey or Justin Bieber it doesn't do any identifiers I know what that site is I know what Perez Hilton or TMZ People magazine I don't I don't know what the musical equivalent would be but when a site has built their readership off of trying to find it once again if I say Indy it gives you this this like oh shit it's supposed to be a a like escape for people who are you just don't like top 40 pop basically sure huh or feel like it's not fair you know what you're talking about like how there's crossover listeners I I don't agree with that because I don't think people really go to pages anymore I don't think people bookmark pitchfork and go to that they come in through their social media channels Oh Drake announced his new single they click on that and the problem is you know consequence of sound does a really good job they're definitely popped amiss and they do list and I do do click bait but they'll do like a lot of unknown bands but the problem is when they post that under Twitter no one's clicking on it they're clicking on Drake goes to a basketball game so in my opinion it's not crossed over as much as its crowding and the big thing about pop them ism it's not really even pitchforks to fault or anybody's fault it's the readers fault but where are these sites that are about discovery for me all of this comes back to discovery because there are people out there whoever's listening this podcast right now must love music and is actively seeking out stuff and there's not a lot of people and there's not a lot of places which is my problem where you can go and you know you're not going to anything manufactured you just get someone trying to help out the little guy or a little but so when you say people aren't crossing over are you saying that you don't think you know you may see a year-end list that has death grips that has Carly Rae Jepsen so on and so forth but you think these lists while you may find them on many music sites they're nice lists are different because you're clicking on that and you're seeing a whole list what I'm saying is what I'm asking you is are you saying that these lists you may see may find them on the internet but they're not reflecting the actual tastes of the people who are reading the lists or the actual music listeners I just don't I don't going back I don't think people are going to consequence of sound to peruse their entire collection and go let's discover some new music they're entering the site through the most important you know to the pop culture world like that it's likely its clickbait but I don't want to say its clickbait yeah you know and once they go there they're not staying going let's click on best undiscovered artist Ted they're just not doing that what I'm saying is there used to be the whole reason why I was a music blogger it's like I guess I'm floating you ain't no Picasso or creme drunkard my old Kentucky blog like these people were like super heroes to me because I couldn't find the music I wanted to find and these people somehow had access to it and that's because they had PR agents you know sending it to of them and it was just a better time because these people were speaking to me as a listener I'm not if you like my I love Mariah Carey I like the new Taylor Swift I have nothing against pop and pop should be reviewed but I think that there should be spaces where pop them ISM if you go against pop optimism you're not an asshole or pretentious be sure it's pretty much gonna turn on itself just like indie and now I'm using it as the hips are way you know indie now is like the worst fucking thing you know it's it's it's perceived as white kids rich kids it's Wes Anderson you know and that's the it bothers me because there was so much about that it wasn't as pretty I have a problem with how pretty music is are you saying like you know overweight four-year-olds can't write the same great record as like Death Grips yeah they can you know I'm not saying Death Grips is pretty I'm that's the worst example I to use this leave death on this because they are a great exception to everything we're talking about okay they got signed to a major right and they got off of it they got signed to a major and then they dropped off but going going off of something that you had just mentioned yeah I understand the prettiness the the marketability but the reason that we see that especially in Indy is and it's not just completely the listeners fault although I guess you know if what the labels and the PR people were providing if the listener didn't like it they wouldn't have bit but in the 2000s once Indy sort of took to the internet and became this huge musical movement it wasn't just the listeners it was just kind of everybody all together you had indie artists who were openly taking big paychecks working with bigger labels signing onto majors playing lark playing to larger crowds playing bigger festivals doing me doing music videos appearing on MTV they were all so yeah but uh you know and they were also openly emulating pop music on their records you know as like a major influence and as a result that meant more record sales that meant more exposure and the listeners took to it you know people didn't sort of look at artists like Arcade Fire and Modest Mouse and the White Stripes and and Death Cab for Cutie and think you gross you know people thought it was that this exciting new thing you know indie sort of sold itself out and it traded in its authenticity for the the security of knowing that they're gonna have a paycheck a year from now because prior to that working in the underground you know as an artist trying to be full-time or even part-time was arduous I mean it was like it was a fucking desert you know unless you lived in a major metropolitan area that had a healthy music scene but even in that instance you couldn't be playing in the same city every single night and expecting decent pay you know you'd have to tour at some point and even back then I mean before the age of cell phones if somebody was fortunate enough to have a tour book for them they'd have to be driving around aimlessly with a map and just have some dudes cell phone or you know sort of phone number that they've never met before and you know just hope that they're gonna be paid at the end of the day the guarantee that you know they may have been promised know everything you said hundred percent right let me ask you a question because this is fascinating to me would you not agree that today more than any other time is if you're a kid in Danville Kentucky where I grew up it's the easiest time that you have it within you to discover new music I think it's the easiest time to discover new music if you have access to the Internet yes absolutely Baga going but simultaneously and and this can't be ignored okay like yeah sure you have you have more access to new music you have more access to different music and you have more access to underground music but and and this came up into discussion when I was talking to the guys in the band dope body a little while ago simultaneously you also have more access than ever to the Taylor Swift's and the carly Rae Jepsen's of the world they always yes you you you've always had access to that prior to the internet but you still have an incredible amount of access to that stuff you know you can't ignore that the fact that the internet obviously those artists have a huge presence on the internet too and that you're probably more likely to run into those artists if you're just happening to be bumbling around on any of these music streaming services or music journalism websites or what-have-you right my point might follow up to the question that was another question we're on the Socratic method here I can open up Spotify and have a hundred years of music it's it's on the listener to type in where the hell they want yeah and they they dictate whatever is going on it's funny if we're looking at this like a graph you know the X and y-axis as it's easier to discover music it's bothersome to me that the same fucking 50 bands musicians are written about by the same taught to your blogs music websites sure so that that makes no sense to me as you know cuz I always looked at music websites specifically mine if you go to my website now you'll be like what the fuck is this I haven't really written on in a while it used to be pretty good in 2010 when we actually didn't have jobs sidebar but I used to look at music blogs independent music blogs as almost like a A&R for labels but not being paid you know you're just trying to but for for listeners basically you're trying to go out you're trying to watch as much music you're trying to check out as many cold submissions and cold submissions are like no PR behind it someone just you know I have my email on the website you know that's how I how I hooked up with my favorite folk singer of all time hip Paget he sent me a cold email and goes I don't have any PR anything here's my track and I loved it and I posted about it and that's dying while cross integration of the same fight why is it that the same rising bands are talking about on Stereogum pitchfork consequence of sound you know and so on and so forth when we have more bands competing we didn't even talked about technology to make music in your basement it's gotten cheaper easier it cost nothing to make an help now so it just it's it's that all goes back to the pop tune ISM things it's taking up space where music discovery could be put in and I know what this conversation come across that I'm saying pop music shouldn't be written about because pop music should definitely be written about but should be written about on pop centric websites sure in a you're also an exception to because from the start you you have I mean I you know I followed your career since the very beginning you've always done hip-hop and country and you know you've been across all genres and and to be fair for pitch short date they have done that for a while too but now it's getting more and more click baiting around the excuse of optimism sorry go ahead okay so so you're basically saying that pop tune ISM is leading to all this clickbait I mean I I tend to agree but the thing is it's it's just kind of ridiculous to sort of just say that the issue starts and ends with pop or pop Tim ISM in general because the thing is and and I've said this before and in speaking engagements that I've done is that with the growth and popularity of indie with the indie scene becoming more of a full-time thing more than a passion project or a hobby for all of these people who have done PR and our artists and run labels and so on and so forth it sort of put us in a situation where our indie singers our indie artists are sort of celebrities and stars in their own right and they have their own social media accounts and you know even though yeah sure we have we have articles out there that are like Drake eats a hamburger but we also simultaneously have articles out there that are like someone so got arrested so-and-so called someone so faggot someone so got in a fight with so-and-so on social media so-and-so told the the band the war on drugs or mark kozilek told the war on drugs to suck his cock in this new song you know so we sort of have turned our own scene into a bit of a clickbait thing when those opportunities arise well no hundred percent I mean what's the argument there I I think the argument there is that you know I I think it's more than just I think it's just more of a reflection of Gawker culture on the Internet then it has anything to do with you know whether or not Drake eats a hamburger or pop music or pop them ISM or whatever but don't you see it's it's it's III I really don't because I see it as more of a result of the internet business model where okay even if we didn't have pop Tim ISM these websites would still be functioning under a business model where clicks means money you know and even if Drake didn't exist they'd be finding something else to write about that would mean clicks means money you know I I think it's more the the business model that lies underneath all of it you know more than it has to do with you know a genuine love of pop music or just music in general you can't people have problems with that business model I mean you can we can say people can certainly have problems with that business model but the thing is nobody nobody's invented a new model you know it's kind of the problem another thing up optimism and this is a new thought I had when I was lying in bed last night you can smack this down if it's bad is it's kind of most music writers are liberals the ones I follow on Twitter have known for eight nine years and in populism to me is a very conservative idea it's very Republican idea it's like let's let's champion the rich and anybody can make it in this field and we're saying the business models flawed we're saying that the little guy needs help but we're saying no no no it's it's a you know someone's like the trickle-down but trickle up like you know like any bank and make it if they just write a hit well that's not true there's so many great look look at Nick Drake you know there's so many great talented timeless artists out there and that's what freaks me out when I wake up in the morning and I just want to listen to everything and try to discover and listen to my submissions is I've probably just office have not heard my favorite musician of all time it's probably out there just off of it you know it's like when they go is there life in the galaxy probably because it's so vast and for a hundred years people have been making music it's pretty old for me to say I've already found my favorite artists so why are we wasting time Drake could be you can put out the best record pop or not pop so let's talk about that that album but let's not talk about the lifestyle reporting and I think pot tomb ism because it is pop culture surrett do you you do agree that they includes a lifestyle reporting yeah absolutely you know and and I think um I think prior to pop team ism you know there were there were all sorts of you know in in zine and other sorts of strange internet scenes and sort of up-and-coming music websites in the late 90s in the in the 2000s I mean what what you could essentially call lifestyle reporting I mean all sorts of weird thought columns on whatever social issues were going on at the seam at the time existed as well so I mean I don't think that's specific to pop team ism and when and when you say lifestyle reporting I mean you know are you talking about something super surface-level you know sort of like what you might find in a fashion magazine or something I'm saying like I want to make it clear that pitchfork is not the only one doing it they are the top dog so that's why I always use them as a reference point but they will do something that just like so crazy me like Drake eats a hamburger Drake gets his shoes stepped on at a basketball game wasn't that the one or no he come to heal in trolled at a basketball game and that was breaking news and everybody clicked on it everybody talked about it or these drink or these Drake memes you know like that's the Internet it doesn't have to be on a critically acclaimed music website let the internet do that let your commenters do that let the no let them have fun with that but that's not does that need to be reported on well you know the thing is I think on the internet there's just really not the type of social barriers that there used to be back in the day you know in real life and and as a result I think everything is just kind of bleeding into itself pop culture is bleeding into indie culture and vice-versa because you do see a lot of these mainstream artists like Drake for example who over the course of his career has endorsed and popularized numerous artists over the years who at one time were painfully obscure and had he not endorsed them and simultaneously ripped off their sounds for his own benefit had he not done that you know they would have been that super underground artist that nobody would have heard of so you have pop music borrowing from indie and vice versa because certainly a lot of these indie artists while they write their records yeah sure it's underground they might be on an independent record as well they might be on an independent record label as well but they're thinking about writing their hit you know they're thinking about putting out their music video you know as out there as and you said that we shouldn't talk about them as out there is a group like Death Grips --is they're definitely sort of playing into that machine to you know the internet PR machine they do tons of shit to get the attention of music writers they do tons of shit to sort of break the typical rules of PR just to get attention which is is the typical rule of PR do whatever the fuck it takes to get attention and you know that they're conscious about putting out their strongest tracks first and getting their music videos together and teasing their audience and creating hype and embracing the memes that people make about them so stayin on Death Grips I'm gonna take over this interview back to you because you're far more interesting Anthony in your Death Grips review did you spend a lot of time speaking do you like to talk about a lot about outside context when you review I watch your videos I just can't remember the second um I think it sort of depends on whether or not it has any significance to the build-up of the album itself or what the album actually addresses topically but you know when I do get an opportunity to I just like to kind of just head straight into the album you know I guess it depends on how outside you're talking I mean I like to try to talk about what the last few albums have been like or maybe what other artists in a similar scene or similar style of music have been doing and if that has any sorts of bearing on what the the album is talking about but you know I don't really like to discuss like let's say for example who this person might be sleeping with unless maybe it comes up in the album itself but you know that's that's that's it really because if I'm going down my check points of buy point against pop tune ISM I guess even though I'm not fully against it some of my favorite writers are optimists almost all of them are now jessica hopper and Caitlin white and people like that was about to say to you holy shit no I feel like the one the big problems of optimism is like Kanye West's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy I was really excited excited a lot of different thoughts on that record and almost every review is about his outside antics and not about the album itself and then they would talk about the production and III think that albums great but I have a lot of problems with the lyrical content of that record um you know in the Chris Rock sketch and those things were just like brushed over as like um anyway yeah the Chris Rock thing was a little bit whatever but still perfect and I was like I would much rather listen like listen to people's take on the lyrical content of that record instead of for paragraphs about you know then he went on to marry Kim card at that time not not happening but like it was all about you know him crashing the VMAs and all the shit's like that to me didn't really matter at all but at the same time I like your point a lot which is that album was reactionary to the moments of his life so I guess you have to talk about it where were you at with that kind of no I mean I would agree with that point it is a reactionary to the moments in his life and you do have to sort of talk about it but I do agree that in the the muddle of trying to figure that out and sort of portray that accurately in the reviews of the record that a worthwhile discussion about the music on the album actually sort of got tossed into the bushes a little bit and I I see a lot of parallels between indie hipster and pop Tim ISM and it's been basically separated by about a decade and a half wouldn't you say I was sugar sugar the worst thing you know looking back is you could be like if you don't like clap your hands say yeah you're just wrong you know or you're stupid it was a very pretentious you like that's what hipsters were known for is they were very passionate and protective over their shitty bands or good bands indie bands but now it's happening with populism but you can't debate back to it because it makes you look like you're just an indie kid sure I'm saying so I see all the time you know I do like Beyonce but people be like bow down to the Queen B Queen Bey oh god I'm old holy shit oh boy as soon as it said babe my liver just gave out oh really no I'm joking uh that would be I think I'd stop the interview at that point but now like I see people just there their love for Beyonce is like crazy crazy and if you say yeah I don't like Beyonce then it's just like you understand where I'm going with this no I understand where you're going you know I've I've run into that same issue you know the thing is this I I think this true sense of as a community let's celebrate underground music and keep the music sort of hidden in the shadows so that it doesn't get poisoned by all this pop mainstream shit I think that kind of died in 2009 with probably the release of Merriweather Post Pavilion because that was just such a huge relevant record not only for Animal Collective but for such a such an odd group with an odd sound and also just the indie scene in general and as soon as that album came out and people who had never been listening to Animal Collective before I loved it and thought it was fantastic the not only the indie press but also just the the pop culture press in general that would be covering such a such a thing like the hype of this album and kind of this band sort of for a lot of these people coming out of nowhere even though they had all these previous records the the the tone that a lot of them took with the animal collective crowd was to kind of cannibalize them and sort of paint this picture of you know here's how you talk to people who are Animal Collective fans you know about the new Merriweather Post Pavilion record you know don't say it's your favorite talk about how strawberry jam is your favorite or feels as your favorite or some tongs is your favorite or you know here's top 10 stereotypical things and Animal Collective fan will say about the new Merriweather Post Pavilion album and so on and so forth so the the whole idea of pretentiousness was kind of poked and prodded and satirized and and and I think it should have been you know I I definitely don't think that that type of a mindset is healthy for the music scene necessarily but I think pop doom ISM sort of comes with its own pretentiousness --is as well I do agree and if you reverse engineer did you say reverse-engineer discover like pretentiousness sometimes it does come from a good place going off on a little tangent here but it's one of my like things I always like to talk about what was the number one hipster thing to do it was to say I knew about blank before anybody sure I heard their first album was better or whatever well yeah I'd say before that it was you know yeah I knew about this band I saw them for you know 10 people you know and I did that all the time but I wasn't trying to do as like to deface the person who's just getting into them it's here's my point with this is they should discovery should be rewarded not shamed upon and I feel like pop team ism allows people to kind of become complacent and I'm not saying because you like pop music but you can just listen to what everybody's telling you is good and you're safe because that's never attack whereas the person who's a pretentious asshole because they said I saw what's a Death Grips where I was a Zach Hill fan so long ago you got to think about it is if you haven't been to a show where you're uncomfortable because there's no one there and you feel bad for the band you're really not trying to discover music I go to three or four of those shows once again coming across pretentious I go to these shows with nobody is that what I'm saying is I'm trying to support bands that need my support and support the local saying the indie saying these people who don't have a lot of money behind them and that's an I strongly believe that's an okay thing to say without being pretentious is that I actively sought out this band that then five years later became big you were the one supporting you know I'm top of Starbucks you know I should be going to local coffee shop you're supporting local you're supporting the underdog you're supporting the person who doesn't have all the opportunities along adeleray might have and that's my probably popped em ism is you can stay in that bubble and just never get attacked but if you're actively seeking out music and trying to help out the problem you know that clickbait and all the problems that we've discussed about the business model if you're individually just trying to help out people who need it you're pretentious you're a hipster and I feel like pop them isms kind of killing that that urge to discover stuff I mean that's that's what makes me so mad about optimism I could be wrong sure okay listen here's here's an issue I have with with that point of view but also papadum ism as well and it's sort of a bit of a bias thing you know I get act and I wince when people sort of throw the idea at me that well if it's popular it must be good you know and I'm sure you've heard that as well and that's bull it happens every year at work shows is this one sold X amount of copies how did it happen with the Anaconda video they go it had 40 million views how did that not even get nominated well that's not what we're fucking talking about sure absolutely byah but simultaneously I feel like what you're talking about has its own bias as well because why should something be supported just because it's underground shouldn't what ultimately matters is that it's good no no I mean the utopian it's almost like communism like there's communism and then there's the utopian idea of it which is the utopian idea of optimism is that you should be listening to everything and pop is just as important as indie or underground and you know lovey dovey but it's not treated that way we're giving way too much more weight to manufactured pop artists yeah okay so so what is I I understand it's you know what what we're actually getting is not actually a reflection of what is promised you know instead of just celebrating music in general and saying hey listen there's no reason to be pretentious anymore there's no reason to say we're gonna ignore so-and-so's top 40 record because it's not underground because it's not indie because it's not artistic because it's not experimental I understand that you know that is that's not a point of view that you want to hold and as a results I I guess what I'm trying to say is fucking reset for a second I understand that that's not a point of view that you want to hold and you know you're sort of saying you're sort of doing this a bit of placating you're talking a good game saying okay you know we're going to love pop music and we're going to love indie music but we've just sort of created this excuse to just continually endorse whatever is already relevant already popular already getting clicks from people instead of trying to push listeners into something that they may have not heard of before yes yes thank you but but simultaneously something that I think is is is really tough though is finding out about these newer artists are these more underground artists and not that you can't find an underground artist but it's kind of hard to sort of play that game as a music journalist especially if you have a platform like what I'm doing because I think what sort of makes the artists underground what makes them obscure what sort of gives them that appeal and sort of puts them in that position is that they're sort of in the shadows and the thing about the Internet is that it tends to sort of get rid of the shadows around everybody everything you know as long as you put a piece of music up on the Internet it's accessible to everyone that has the internet you know nothing is really terribly obscure anymore I mean nothing is more than a Google search away as far as music goes and you know if something is to sort of be truly underground I feel like probably your best avenue to do that is to just stay away from the internet entirely if you don't want anyone to hear your music or if you just want to very select few people to hear your music keep it off the internet and make sure it goes nowhere near it and if I were to do something like cover you know one of these incredibly obscure artists all I would be doing is sort of pulling them out of that context and putting them into the context of either the pop artists or the semi popular indie artists who you know like your sleighbells and your Ariel Pink's and your so that your Johanna Newsome's and all that who yeah sure I mean the in a sense they may be making alternative music but in their own right there they're still pop stars in the sense I'm not saying underground music is all under the most underground music is actually pretty bad you know anybody with a laptop can make music now I'm just I was saying you you have to actively go out and try not necessarily under grant I don't think bands most bands today don't want to be underground I think they want to be known most of the bands I know one of you famous they want to become these things like pop stars I guess um was your point that I don't understand your point I guess I would say I guess I I guess my point is as music writers and as people who cover music I think it's kind of hard to maintain this narrative that we should be emphasizing underground stuff we should be emphasizing discovery we should be sort of always trying to push the listener into something that they haven't heard of especially given that the artists themselves are so quick to give that narrative up the moment that they become popular you know what I mean you know you don't have any of these indie artists getting popular these days saying oh I'm not selling out or you know I'm not trying to get popular or you know I'm just trying to stick to the the set amount of people who hear my music and I'm just keeping it to them and I'm you know sort of keeping true and authentic to the sound that I've always done and so on and so forth and and not that I think that they need to really make that sacrifice anymore you know I think a place like the Internet has allowed a very alternative artists to sort of flourish and explore experimental sounds and and sort of simultaneously you know do those Absolut Vodka endorsements if they so choose there's no more so I know as soon as albums including digital now as soon as albums people stop buying albums there's no way to make money other than selling out as what people used to say but now it just be making a living you know the placements is the name of the game that's only way you can make money now and we're at or if you're big enough yeah I'm just you were talking about the shadows in underground and I think we have different definitions of the underground I'm talking about unknown so maybe I should say unknown bands not like we're so indie here's a good one for you why aren't there because there are out there why aren't pop bands breaking out on their own that's another problem when I have good pop Tim ISM is no band has ever just made it on their own as a pop in it's always been a process through a big machine sure and and you're saying like you know why isn't well I mean you you could argue that that you know Justin Bieber was sort of discovered although once he was discovered he got picked up by Usher and then she's placed into the machine I'm not saying they weren't talented beforehand but I'm saying like you've never heard a story other way you know okay here's an example and I know that you like his namesake and they pause and you give me one example does not prove the point wrong well I know I mean I well yeah I'm saying it's I think it's a significant example and and you and you like his new single as well and and I understand the the argument that one single example they'll change it I was gonna say Macklemore you know because his his debut record his debut EP totally independent huge hits right he's off major labels right I'm not completely sure as to whether or not that's the case but even if he isn't directly signed to a major label at this point he's probably distributed through one so Nick Meghan Trainor I think was the same way I might be wrong didn't she just write that baby song I mean we're doing two examples of the whole scene of pop music what I'm saying is there's not a lot of and there's a reason for that which is a lot of pop music's about the production and the catchiness and that costs money sure Taylor Swift's record I only know how much it cost but the studio time and the level of production I think it's a fantastic sounding record whether you like pop or not but there is money behind it allow me to do we have enough time keep going dude give thanks it's like a marathon on here we're having a discussion I went to school you're yelling at me now I went to school for film and I wanted to be a director and kind of you know freshmen you don't know what the fuck want to be and the screenwriter came in I think was Bob Gale who wrote Back to the Future and he was given a lecture he said the reason why I'm a screenwriter is that when I go up against someone it's a blank page versus a blank page he goes when a director goes up like if it's anti Fantan / Steven Spielberg Steven Spielberg has a budget of 60 million you have a budget of nothing except for your webcams do you shoot out webcams no III a DSLR it looks beautiful but that point is always stay with me for art and especially art as commerce which is you have to maybe I just want these pop them is to say there is an unfair advantage and address that and kind of I don't know I'm trying to eat are you with me at all in this no I I hear I hear the point you're make and just make it well that's what I'm saying I'm just saying it's not fair I'm saying pop music is not fair so I think a reaction to it is to go I want to listen to underground I want to listen to indie stuff I want listen to peer okay so I guess my question is then where does this idea of fairness come in then because honestly it's not fair I agree but it's never been you know I mean and and I mean the way it was before and and again I don't think it's totally a fair again but I think the way it was previously it was sort of like pop music and music that was signed to labels were sort of in the castle with the King and he had his servants and everything was clean and and sort of you know nicely taken care of and meanwhile any band that was sort of unsigned and obscure and unknown were outside and they were you know sort of in the feudal system and they were mucking around in the dirt and they were just wondering where the fuck their next meal was going to come from and I feel like the Internet has sort of allowed us to rush the castle and turn it into a bit of a democracy but the powerful are still powerful you know it's sort of like what we have going now I mean yeah sure we we vote our leaders in and out of office but of course there's still big money in politics just like there's still big money in music despite the fact that you know your average bedroom producer does have more opportunities for exposure then he might have 20 or 30 years ago I like talking to you because if you really listen when you debate or talk with someone you can completely change your mind on something and I think you gave like my biggest point of optimism that I'm about to say you just gave me and I never really thought about it why I'm upset is you said it's not fair and it's never been fair and I agree with that I think there's a hundred percent true but now we have a word that lets people be unfair and wear it like a badge of courage and that bothers me okay but you just said is like it's not fair it's never been fair so why are you trying to change the system but now we have this thing called optimism which is if you're not a Potamus your narrow-minded your pretentious you're still stuck in the past but you just said it's not an it's not a positive thing through and through pop music's great I'm not trying to argue against pop music but you just said it's not fair hmm and now we have a word that makes you like it's it's true and I agree it's not fair it's never been fair but I do think it is fairer then it's been so I do think there's been improvement however I don't think that we should merely take this improvement as this is as good as it's gonna get and let's not progress from here but but my question is you where is the progression from here you know because ultimately we can advocate for unknown underground artists all that we like but I don't think we're going to see real palpable long-term change until there is a business model change and and and and and I mean a business model change in terms of our how our media sort of works and and I and I don't know if and just just let me make this next point and and I don't I'm not completely happy about this you know but there's some artists that I know that if I didn't cover them and that doesn't necessarily mean I have to cover them positively or cover them negatively because then I have a boss over my head saying that I have to say a good thing or a bad thing about a rat about a record but let's say for example the new Kendrick Lamar record that I just reviewed I love that record and I was happy to review that record because I am a fan of his music but simultaneously it can't be ignored that it wouldn't have made sense for me not to review that album you know as far as you know the the solvency of my own business look everything if you talk about like streaming and every problem within art comes the fix comes on a individual level if enough people are clicking on anti-fan tano's new your bank amp feature where you're like you was it called it came from band camp or we just like pull pull together all these really strange band camp pages I mean like if a section on pitchfork that highlights new artist blows up everyone's gonna emulate that and I've talked shit on pitchfork for over a decade I've been reading them since like 99 more pretentious indicia to say leave comments that cart the thing is it's not their province that failed they had to evolve with the clickbait to survive and be number one all right but if readers I mean there's a reason why BuzzFeed is taking over the worlds because everybody and their brothers vote you vote with your clique and I know it's so far out of control that you can say like oh I can't change anything but you can you can you know instead of saying hey Anthony why aren't you reviewing the new Taylor Swift record you can actually you know I'm try saying if there's an unknown band let's not say underground unknown band that you're friends with and you really love you have people on Facebook you have Twitter you can leave a comment to Anthony you know you can promote these people that are unheard of you know and that's how it's gonna change is people clicking on the right things asking for you know a thirst for discovery that I think is just missing down okay and and I agreed that that thirst is is missing but let me let me tell you sort of my experience with with that stuff sort of from my point of view when I'm when I'm making videos and I'm you know coming up with content to produce so of course you know we know that and to go back to Kendrick Lamar you know he's his video is my most viewed video of all time and I reviewed his new record this year but the thing is there are artists who sell more records than him but when I review their records they don't get quite as many hits so you know we have artists that are as popular or more popular than Kendrick Lamar who if I review them it doesn't necessarily generate more traffic or as much traffic as his to the butterfly review did and that may have something to do with the the point of view of the review but there are other reviews that I've done where I've given an equivalent score or other reviews that I've done that have been negative and have come completely have come very close in terms of traffic so I can't completely chalk it up to the point of view I think it really kind of has to do with the buzz that that artist has online and whether or not that artist sort of has the type of fan and makes the type of music that people sort of appreciate on an intellectual level in such a way where they value conversation about that music if I reviewed the new Taylor Swift record and I've reviewed pop stars that are pretty huge as well I'm Lady gaga for example you know her reviews that I've done of her music there are other hip-hop records and rock records that I've reviewed that have gotten way more hits because they happen to have the certain type of fan who goes out seeking reviews and opinions and points of and alternative points of view about those artists let's put it the test when you post this podcast all right post the screenshot of 19 1989 as no one's called mm-hmm Taylor Swift and say review Taylor Swift 1989 and I guarantee you we will triple any podcast guess you've had and there but we're talking about review for review here and and and I'm not and I'm not done making my point so and and and the flipside of my point is when I review artists who are obscure it's a bit of it's a bit of a crapshoot you know sometimes it just ends up getting 10,000 views sometimes I review that artist and they sort of get a really strong passionate and small following within my community and sometimes those artists end up putting out future records and they make money off of that record or they get a little tour together or they end up getting signed I'm thinking of artists sort of in the case of young fathers or injury reserve or clipping or milo i know that you know i was one of the people early on supporting what Death Grips was doing and as a result you know they got a lot of hype behind what they were doing in their music my point is is that it's not that avenues of music discovery aren't there and it's not that people aren't trying it's that I think the audience just isn't that interested and I don't think they were that interested 20 or 30 years ago you know I think people unfortunately tend to gravitate toward things that they are already familiar with whether that be an artist or that be a genre or a style or a sound that they already know people ask me consistently you know hey man I listen to this kind of metal I listen to this kind of indie I listen to this kind of rap can you recommend me a bunch of stuff it like you know that sounds like Radiohead you know or something like that people unfortunately and this is just you know a certain type of music listener they just want to stick to what they're familiar with and I mean I guess I I sort of have to appreciate that because you know I don't want to alienate anybody who feels that way just because you know I have this idea in my head is how they should listen to music you know I mean but there was a time where they're always websites across all genres you know pushing discovery so there what there was an audience for it at some point now it's gone I I think you know we're sort of talking about a time when people were sort of providing a service that that other websites weren't or at least not to the satisfaction of the music listening audience and and I think as a result you know a lot of these pop leaning music blogs that have sort of you know figured out a business model that makes them money have kind of drowned out a lot of these smaller blogs that came up in the middle and the end of the 2000s who were essentially just kind of doing it as a hobby and eventually fell off because you know those people found other interests or other things that they had to do instead because they just couldn't sort of pour everything into into this music website you know the the unfortunate thing is is that what ended up happening is that the people who are in it long term and are still in it now just found a way to sort of make money on it and if I hadn't gravitated over to YouTube I wouldn't have found out a way to sort of make a living off of what I'm doing you know if I had just stuck to my blog and said I'm just going to do my blog I'm just going to do my podcast you know we would be having this conversation in front of way fewer people I still I'm gonna frame that direct message where you're like I'm thinking about starting a YouTube blog mm-hmm DMA yeah you're talking about how you've you've been following my work for years you know even before you knew who I was I emailed you and I was like hey I like your blog and now you're famous and I'm living alone I'm joking listen we got to end it we started to press Lucinda depressed no um yeah I don't know I had a point and I started talking about when you DM me so well I agree with you about the flaws of pop team ISM and and I think I I'm in full agreement about the flaws you know but I think I think the upside is that it gives me an opportunity to sort of talk about obscure and underground artists as I please and then kind of review these artists that have more exposure are more popular I end up getting traffic and subscribers as a result of that so when the next opportunity comes to review a more obscure artist those people are exposed to something that they wouldn't have found out about before right you know and that's just kind of the pattern that I work on and it's not a pattern that I think I always execute perfectly you know sometimes there are way too many pop records on my plate that I would like to deal with and and sometimes you know that there's a sea of obscure albums that I have that that I want to deal with but there's not you know kind of a relevant record in sight for the next few months you know at least to me anyway but but I think it's it's just kind of at least the position that I'm in you know and while the clickbait thing and you know the the clique and traffic money-making model is is very flawed I think we're all just kind of figuring out our way around it while staying is true as we can to what we're doing so that we can kind of look at ourselves in the mirror in the morning yeah and I think the best thing if I argue if I flip trolls and say like all right now I'm proof optimism that's the best thing about baptism is it highlights something that was the worst part about being a hipster which is that just because you like some sort of music it doesn't make you smarter or better you know like you can listen I insane clown posse and because it's subjective there's no value put on it you know people have their opinions and they love to be snarky about music but literally you know maybe Britney Spears just as an artistic document not talk about the money made or anyone that could be better than Death Grips you know and you can make that argument and that's one of the things it's like it takes the class out of it it takes like oh I went to the University of blank blank and I listen to The Shins you know that was the biggest problem with hipsters is people thought they were cooler because of what they listened to we're in and pop them is it kind of makes it but where I will argue is effort you can put in more effort and I think that makes you a better listener if you are actively within this new pop miss world if you're actively trying to discover everything to the best of your bility I know we all work and you know musics of leisure activity but you can't argue with effort I'm sorry if you only listen to Taylor Swift this year you're not as informed as the other music listener who's watching your YouTube videos or going to you know talking to the friends going to shows just taking it I think everyone should just take more chances on things like when's the last time you've heard about someone going like I'm just gonna go that bar because it has live music there used to be live music signs and people go oh that's live music um I go check it out like I think we forgot what music was you know cuz there's so much of it well I think it's I think it's just kind of indicative of of what the trend has been ever since you've given and and and I don't want to get into another discussion about this you know I think you made a great point in them will end its podcast but I think it's indicative of the trend that has occurred ever since you gave the public easier access to music through recordings going back to the days of some of the first consumer phonograph records you know because primarily people how used to people may have people used to make their livings was just playing in live bands and there used to be a live band in every venue and every bar no matter where you went because people wanted to hear music as they socialized and drank and had fun and now recorded music people don't need to go out of their way to hear music they can just listen to music in the comfort of their own home they don't need to leave the house especially in an age where what you end up seeing on stage as far as the performance isn't anywhere near as good as you know the the image that you're getting on the cover and the high-gloss production that you're getting on the album but again you you you make a you know a really excellent closing point and I think this has been a good conversation I like talking to you Anthony I like talking to you too I like talking to you more I will I will accept that as truth and but I will say that I have a bigger crush on you than you do on me ah yeah well you both hate Cal so that's good we do alright I will leave a link to shit should i link to your website should I get people your email should I give people your nude photos your Twitter what when I figure out my life the website will start again so don't even link up we listen for you go to uh go to my Twitter page I talk about shit there okay I will link to Zach's Twitter page and we will probably have another conversation at some point in the future if we decide another topic or if we decide pop them ism is worth another nosedive oh all right thank you everyone for listening and Zach is going to read for you a very beautiful haiku that he'd written before the recording of this podcast summer I'm not doing that live by "
p0Mf2bOioec,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Justin Bieber record purpose that's right at this channel needle drop or we have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of music reviews just on video me blah blah blah blah blah we are about to make history over here breaking my Bieber cherry oh of you in that Biebs that Bugatti Bieber okay purpose is the latest full-length album from child singing sensation now become adult like many people do as they age Justin Bieber Bieber in this latest record of his follows a couple turbulent years for the Biebs but he has made it through and it seems that in this latest media blitz of him and this album he is trying to project a more mature in edgier a tatted up image this record is a tight 13 tracks has a handful of features Travis Scott Big Sean Haugh C Diplo and Skrillex produce a track on here which actually was a song that was featured on the Jack u album that came out earlier this year the production on this thing is very sleek very modern very atmospheric a lot of the time seems a little weakened influenced especially toward the beginning of the album but that vibe doesn't continue throughout the entire record in the production list you can catch people like sounds as well as Skrillex among many others and I will give it to this album I think the production is actually pretty nice it's artful it's textured it's a little refined at points it's got a really nice classy reverb on some of the instrumentation here which really opens up the space of these instrumentals and gives just in room to sort of do what he's doing vocally and really sets a moody oan for a lot of these songs even the tracks that do have heavier kick drums and seem more danceable it's a nicely balanced album musically and sonically I like that we have poppier harder-hitting tracks here as well as cuts like love yourself which is very quiet it's very intimate it's a very sweet song mostly consisting of a sweet little guitar lick and some classy horns on the back end of the track which is a very warm contrast to the very sad lyrics justin is delivering on this song I wouldn't say the production and the instrumentals on this thing are blowing me away but it certainly makes the album palatable for somebody who has never really been a Justin Bieber fan all of the issues I have with purpose though are vocal because the truth is with age Justin has grown to be such a bland nondescript completely unimpressive singer which I'm not really surprised over because at this point we're looking at essentially the second wind of a career from a guy who was essentially put into the place he was to just kind of be this pretty face for young girls to fawn over developing child stars and musicians into entertaining and successful adult stars and musicians can be kind of a crapshoot and I think this new Justin Bieber record over here is proof of just how high the odds are stacked because chances are Justin's very boring nasal wimpy kroons all over this record are only going to work on people who are just desperate to have their heartstrings pulled now I think there are some flashes in the pan on this record where Justin is delivering a bit of personal emotion like on love yourself or on the track life is worth living or on the title track here which is maybe the most passionate vocal performance Justin gives on the entire record however don't expect to be wowed by these songs if you are at all turned off by very sappy lyricism and even though I like Justin singing on these songs it's not really stirring me in any way emotionally and that's the thing his singing in general it's not terrible it's just become merely passable take the song children for example which just kind of sounds like an EDM banger following right after the track that was originally a Jack u song and the track is so formulaic that it's like Justin doesn't even really need to be in the equation for it to be what it is it's crazy to think that it's just been five years since Justin Bieber blew up and became this huge mainstream music star and it's been kind of a rough five years with its highs and it's lows and I'm not exactly sure if this record is doing that great of a job of making the case for the next five years of Justin Bieber because the way I figure it is that he has an aging fanbase that eventually one day are going to have diversified interests and and care about other things and Justin Bieber is going to be this big part of their lives anymore and then there's this other group of adults who have always been skeptical of his fame and his success and I don't necessarily see this album winning them over either the producers definitely came through on here with some great instrumentals and and some of the tunes on the singer decent but Justin himself is one of the least interesting things about his own album I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing transition what did you think of this record did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Bugatti Bieber forever 
WyLYH0s9rHM,oh hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and to kick off this review we are going to have Cal chesta reading a wonderful comment hi everyone this is Kendrick Lamar Tendo blahblahblah this whole album is a ripoff of L of the Kendrick album and every sang sounds like Kendricks floor because Kendrick is the best Kendra Kendra Kendrick que da ki Pam is a classic and this is just trash because nobody can touch my daddy Kendrick Kendrick que da blablabla I give a strike free to LA for transition let me know if you thought and if you agree Kendricks next project is in instant kegs logic is a Maryland rapper aka young Sinatra and he is back with a new full-length commercial album just a year after the release of his commercial debut under pressure striking while the iron is hot I see through a series of mixtapes great performances freestyles logic has proven himself to be a formidable spitter a decent lyricist and a pretty versatile artist he has delivered club bangers grimy old-school hardcore hip-hop boom bap bap and some very smooth moody jazzy and introspective tracks as well and he seems to have a pretty tight grasp of all the various hip-hop styles that he has been emulating over the past several years which is great but after numerous projects I still feel like I don't quite have a grasp of who he is as an artist he has technical ability he can put a song together he can certainly flow he's got a decent voice he picks likable beats and he can follow through with the concept on a song but this is like a lot of baseline stuff beyond that I can't help but feel like his style is just to compile posit of his contemporaries who he is just a little too eager to follow in the footsteps of most notably Kendrick Lamar and Drake and sadly this continues on to his new album over here but this record is not without its improvements upon what logic was doing on his last record first off the production the budget on this production seems much larger and it doesn't show in a really extravagant producer list with a lot of huge names or anything like that although there are some notable people who do show up there is DJ Khalil and DJ dahi and six among many others who help make this album sound great including logic who apparently has numerous producer and co-producer credits on this record it's pretty cool to sort of see his talents expanding into the realm of beats because the beats actually sound pretty fantastic on this thing the instrumentals on this project are lush they're gorgeous they're densely layered and pretty well arranged when they bring in some orange or some strings some of what goes on here is is almost soundtrack worthy kind of orchestral especially the intro track and of course there's some jazzy pianos on here as well as some trap influenced bangers I wouldn't say the production is mind-blowing or envelope-pushing or game-changing but it is well assembled and there are quite a few highlights in the track listing the looped hypnotic vocal harmonies on the song fade away are great also the very area theory would winds on like well the booming percussion on the song young Jesus is a little bit of a throwback although not as much of a throwback as the intro would allow you to think let's take a book to the note dues it's not so much like we're going deep into the 90s like 94 or anything like that it's more 1999 young Mos Def black on both sides 90s also the song paradise which features some very smooth moody beautiful instrumentation a bassline that seems a heavily influenced by the sharain intro from good kid maad city alternative singer Jesse Boykins appears on a feature he's one of the few features on here and actually that's a pretty cool that logic keeps the album mostly to himself and sort of carries the album on his back and for the most part he does a good job in that respect I don't really feel like I'm dying to hear anyone's voice anyone else's voice by the end of the record which I think has a lot to do with logics versatility as he bounces around from one emotion from one flavor to the next but that being said Boykins does provide a really great deep emotional vocal during his appearance on this record I think this album has a lot of good things going for it musically but there is a bit of a distraction here a bit of a subplot it's a storyline that we are introduced to at the very beginning of the album it takes place on a spaceship and is mostly played out through dialogue between two of the head officers on this ship it takes place in the future and these people are essentially looking for a hospitable planet to replace the planet we used to live on the population of humanity has dwindled down to like five million people and now we're just looking for another planet which we are calling paradise and it adds to the ritzy feel of the album because the voice acting is pretty good the sound effects are very vivid and rich these little bumpers as weak as some of the dialogue is feel pretty cinematic and and I think this most definitely comes from logics love of filmmakers like Tarantino and just film in general it's almost as if he wanted to put a movie within his album and the way logics music plays into this story is that his album over here which is new to us and old to the people in the story they're playing his record they're calling it oldies and this album is essentially their soundtrack to finding this new planet maybe logic gets a little too self congratulatory with his involvement in this story as the main characters here refer to this album as the album that changed everything and one more thing that would never happen in the future we have one of the spaceship commander asking the computers AI to impersonate Big Sean because he just really wants to talk to Big Sean no no no no no no no no no no no as far as the individual songs on this record go I think logic gives some good performances here but his will to trend chase I think kind of drowns out his lyrical efforts and talents there are some people who are going to hear this record and they're going to instantaneously call copycat and maybe that's true in a sense but I feel like logic is capable of so much more than what he's doing sometimes and I'm just not really feeling some of the heavy-handed predictions he's making for his own music not only with the introduction of this record but on the track fade away as well just like I'm not sure if logic is aware just how Drake ish some of his vocal inflection sound on some of these tracks like on the computer skit toward the beginning of this record where we are talking about the spaceship systems being updated so that they can emulate different people across time and history and so on and so forth logic is updated so that he can emulate more rappers more accurately eely eely and in the midst of these emulations logic does throw in these really speedy paradiddle flows on a lot of these tracks but a lot of them are really just not leaving that much impact for me it's almost as if he's like spitting lines of passionless code at me that just don't leave that much of an impression and of course I mean that there are tracks on here just like his last album that specifically Ryan me of other songs I mean the intermission on here so smooth jazzy and neo-soul inspired it doesn't sound too far off from something from to pimp a butterfly and on the track I am the greatest there are a few moments on here that kind of remind me of Drake's and Kanye's flashing lights actually comes to mind on the song city of stars one of my least favorite tracks on the record with the exception of very heart fell first on the back end of this song actually probably the most lyrically poignant moment the entire record logic goes into label issues music industry stuff race love politics and social things he's addressing deeper topics here as well as on the song paradise where he talks a little bit about love his past his perseverance on the song never been I find logic singing to be really passionate really a heart wrenching at points I had no idea he had so much vocal range he's one of the few rappers out there right now who I think sings as well as he raps the refrain on here about not letting the devil in set against the very luscious strings on this song it's definitely a high point definitely a very gorgeous moment on the album but these songs really account for a handful of my favorite moments on the LP when logic slows down typically and drops other lines on many of these other very middle-of-the-road tracks his mind gravitates towards things like being really happy he didn't get a girl pregnant in college or just various musings about his rap skills and his dreams and the music industry which is all fine and all good but I don't really find logics observations on any of these things to be all that refreshing or new making the LP even less memorable in a sense are the constant instances of deja vu where I just feel like I'm being reminded of someone else as I'm listening to this record in my head logic racks up one comparison after another to a bunch of very popular hip-hop artists who have come out with records over the past five years and yeah that maybe that's not a big deal to you and I wouldn't say it's a huge deal to me I mean I do like the record I do like the album but it keeps the album from being exciting surely so at the end of this project I'm feeling very much like logics last project I think it's decent I think it's skilled I think it's got a lot of great foundation underneath it I like the instrumentals the storyline that moves along with the songs is cool even if the songs have very little to do with the storyline itself maybe with the exception of a few spots where his lyrics directly reference things like paradise as space and that kind of ties into the tale but I just kind of feel like I'm listening to the last album but with kind of a bigger budget I see the effort made here and I appreciate the effort but it's like logic put effort into everything aside from making his own style his own lyrics his own voice more distinct and less comparable to his contemporaries I'm feeling a light too decent sex on this it's decent it's alright session have you given this record a listen have you given it a try are you loving it more than me is the greatest record that you've ever heard in your entire life let me know and tell me why in the comments you think I'm wrong and I'm a horrible person thank you thank you for watching thank you for commenting smash that like and it's about a yo anthony Fantana logic forever 
tqsAhkiDVW4,I don't want to be alone in my bed that any internet smash that like crack the knee pipe tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new revenge album behold total rejection this is the latest full-length LP from incredibly consistent and unbelievably this year extreme metal duo revenge a follow-up to 2012's scum collapse eradication but you may mostly remember them from 2008 infiltration downfall death or their debut record triumph genocide Antichrist this new LP over here seems like the only album in the band's discography where they're not just playing some kind of game of brutal word-association and actually stringing together a coherent thought behold total rejection and reject they do anything that might sound the least bit musical rejections sound is a spiraling hell storm of grimy buzzsaw guitars and bass booming claustrophobic drums and vocals the screech scream gargle gurgle roar make just about every horrific sound you could imagine there are moments on this LP that make the last pissed grave record sound like easy-listening it's like every piece of instrumentation in the mix on this record isn't so much working together and backing one another up as much as they are just hacking each other to death in a concrete octagon to an audience of onlookers that are cheering for the moment where they just all bleed to death I will say the instrumentation does flow together in terms of a intensity though there are moments on this album where you'll hear plenty of violent free-flowing blast beats and very manic guitars occasionally the guitars and the drums slow down to sync up on some very heavy crunchy mosh friendly riffs and one more thing that kind of grabbed my attention about this album is for a band that music that is so extreme revenge certainly takes pride in its long game typically when a band indulges in music that is this bro all the songs tend to have a very kind of short gimmicky structure to them but revenge consistently writes tracks that are three four six minutes long it's like these tracks are an endurance test not just for the band but also the listener and I feel like writing longer songs kind of causes revenge to be a little creative when they create their coffin II they have to pull together the ugliest sounds and aspects of not just grindcore but death metal and black metal while yes revenge maybe making noise for the entire duration of a song it's not the same noise if you give a listen to these tracks you will hear changing tempos and shredded guitar solos and just really badass buzzsaw riffs it's all a barrage but over the course of a song and the album itself it's like different flavors of a barrage but it's not so different that revenge creates a series of memorable distinct moments across the tracklist here unfortunately which is probably what some people would call the point on this album since revenge's nihilistic tendencies seem to kind of guide the writing process of these songs revenge doesn't seem so much as interested in communicating musical and sonic ideas to you as much as they are reaching through the speakers with their guitars and their drums and ending your life really I tried listening to this album several times over just scanning it for something that sticks out to me and every moment that something might seem very freakish to me I was kind of left with just a lack of how exactly to describe it in a way that I'm not just kind of describing the album generally and then maybe a few minutes later I'd hear another moment that I thought wow this kind of sounds even more crazy insane and psychotic than what I had just heard a few minutes ago and on the song mobilization rights of end of this track I was kind of impressed with just how fluid the drums and the guitars felt in pace on this track kind of reminded me of that burst beat style of playing that I caught on liturgies Aesthetica and loved so much you know I will say as messy and as noisy as the songs on this project are the guitars and drums are tight as hell when they want to be and occasionally there are some very weird rudimentary and somewhat psychedelic effects that pop up on some of the instrumentation here I'm not exactly sure if it's a drum or if it's a grunt that lands on some of these songs but there will be this echo on the spoon or overall this record is just kind of a an aggressive nihilistic thrill and I like it sure it's one-dimensional but it scratches a niche and it's a very primal itch it's the only itch that it scratches that primal itch but it scratches it so so good I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why why why why why and what do you think I should review next with my face anthony Fantana revenge forever 
Y65MsRxYYAs,uh hi everyone Anthony and tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new garden record haha the garden is a California rock duo this is their sophomore full-length LP and it is 35 minutes of ultra weirdo punk loaded with crunchy bass lines hyper drum beats some synthetic percussion as well along with some odd samples and maybe some keyboards it's like this cauldron of mi a and Devo and Atari Teenage Riot and the prodigy coming together in this trashy blend of punk and pop punk and electronic music instrumentally what this album offers is skeletal but it's pretty odd but what makes it odder are the vocals of mr. Wyatt shears his voice is very animated it's contorted it almost sounds like a joke band started by two dudes just so that they could go down to the local open mic nights in their immediate area and perform to freak out the locals in retrospective of writing this review it's also little Mindless Self Indulgence ish but somehow they wound up on epitaph records and they sound completely serious about their lack of serious now this thing is 17 tracks long so a lot of this album's runtime is spread out among these one and two minute long tracks nothing really overstays its welcome or develops all that far now the music on this thing keeping with the Punk spirit is very simple very direct it's not flashy in any sort of way even on the tracks that don't really take a rock approach like the track jesters game we're on here we have a lot of looped beats a few eerie Cynthia and there along with a couple noisy samples and the structure of the track the verse chorus verse it's pretty cut and dry and I think this simplicity in this directness puts a lot of emphasis on the vocals as does the mix the vocals are very high in the mix and I understand why the vocals are the most unique thing that garden has going for them and they are very standout they are very odd and some of the hooks on this thing are instantly catchy red green yellow yellow switch lights everything has a face there are just so many lyrical refrains on this thing that stick in my head just out of sheer weirdness the issue is though is that the vocals become obnoxious after a little while unfortunately as much as I do get a Devo vibe from the singing simultaneously it's like listening to a mutant Billy Joel Armstrong of Green Day yeah and I think it could have been worse it definitely could have been worse but the only reason it doesn't get worse is that I think the songs all stop they all end before they reach their full annoying potential after a while the lack of substantive songwriting on this record just loses flavor and it just kind of makes the album seem really redundant a little OneNote because even as they switch it up other instrumental elements of the garden sound get kind of redundant as well the very thin farty echoey bass lines the claustrophobic drums as well as the vocals like I said earlier now I think there are some highlights on this record there are songs that I like like red green yellow or the song egg which oddly enough is kind of this weird piano rock tune that pops up out of nowhere sounds like a combination of lounge music and The Strokes one minute it's really slick the next minute there are these roaring bass riffs that remind me of the Minutemen and the freakish in dark devour is definitely a highlight for me as well strange that two of my favorite tracks on the record are like two of the longest tracks on the record but whatever they're all small very likable qualities about almost every track here but they also have issues that add up into large issues over the run of this entire album I think that the garden they very eclectic and very strange and oddball and while these characteristics definitely make them stand out simultaneously as sort of pigeon holes the music to into this one sort of gear that it never quite switches out of even with again the stylistic window-dressing changes from one track to another I think they have some cool ideas I think they have a lot of energy a lot of chutzpah but the song ideas are just way too rough and sketchy I'm feeling a decent two strong five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what do you think I should review next and smash that like um and that's about it Anthony Fantan oh the garden ha forever 
2eRDcCJFhX0,a boy I have I have a popin clean-shaven and week hey everyone Antoine Fant Wan here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new gold linked album and after that we didn't talk gold link is a DC rapper who for about a year now has been on an independent come up off the back of his last full-length album the god complex came out last year and I didn't really feel any type of way about it personally I I saw the versatility and the potential and what gold link was doing he seemed to have this kind of interesting cross-section of different hip-hop styles going on in his music a little bit of pop rap a bit of hip house some conscious hip-hop and jazz rap too and he's also one of these rappers that mixes singing into his flow and takes on a bit of a an R&B flavour when he does so so he's really a mix of a lot of different things however I think goldlink on this new album over here continues to emphasize that singer side of his repertoire even more but this is kind of the trend lately we have rappers who simultaneously are also singers and they hop on very bright uppity jazzy instrumentation think of people like chance the rapper who I actually think goldlink borrows from quite a bit on this album especially on the first two tracks where the beat also his flow I mean I feel like you could just plug chance the rapper into this track and he would do it just as well if not a little better because I do think chances voice is a bit more distinct and expressive than what goldlink is doing a lot of the time but goldlink does have his own little vocal quirks he has a bit of a rasp a bit of a cracking in the vocal as he's rapping to show you that he's putting emotion into it man and on this track Zipporah he has a few heady lines a few introspective lines on this song to make you know that he's relatable but he's also given you a little food for thought and the way the album is set up it seems all as if gold Lake is going to lay out a bit of a personal story album or something because his mom comes bust into the room and says get up you got to go to church but the album very quickly on the third track kind of loses track of its own story really right on the song dark-skinned women and believe me the title of this track excites me but the narrative that the two tracks had set up previously isn't really there and then we have this really cheap lyrical content going on gorilla or Estella the song is just really sappy and just kind of meant to woo any lady listeners that might happen to be with an ear shot and I have a hard time believing that that is going to end up happening because the singing on this track and actually consistently throughout the whole album is a somewhat horrendous I have no idea what convinced him he should sing this much on this song and the rest of this record especially given he has some incredibly capable guest singers on some of these tracks who consistently outshine him every time someone else is allowed to sing maybe if the lyrics were really sharp or creative or out there maybe if gold links voice was really distinct and eclectic I could see his cracking voice and his weak vocal lines and his strained vocals getting a bit of a pass from me but since his voice doesn't really have that many distinct characteristics nor is his lyrical content that stellar or fantastic or poignant I'm just kind of left not only bored by much of what's going on here lyrically but kind of wincing at a lot of what is going on here as far as singing and just vocal performances like on the song dance on me where the bad singing as well as the lyrics make sex actually sound gross goldlink doesn't have the charisma the character the personality or the swagger to make lyrical content like this work and if you want an example on this record of this working just listen to the song unique Anderson Pak appears you might remember him from working with dr. Dre recently bus driver when he appears and he drops lines like is that your ass I'm holding there is an element of comedy to that there is swagger there there's personality there it's cute it's luring the way that he sort of puts that line goldlink has no such charisma on this record not only that but the instrumental on this track is like a throwback to kind of this era where synth funk and R&B and and disco were kind of at a bit of a crossroads it's just really really homely but as soon as Anderson appeared just like the instrumental becomes instantaneously clear and good and funky I don't know what it is about the moments where gold link is actually singing but the instrumental is like horrific dude can just not catch a break on his own record unfortunately the song palm-trees delivers more flat redundant just completely unbearable vocal lines I mean unbearable to the point where I am praying for auto-tune I'm praying for it but that still would not fix the sappy lyrics and yeah I get it this album is not like ice JJ fish or anything but obviously he is trolling he is obviously trolling this album is totally serious I will say though and the second verse of this track Gold Lane's vocals do improve as he reaches into his upper register he actually gets a little passionate but it's at this point that the vocals really only become tolerable not that they wow me or anything like that as we go deeper toward the end of the album we have songs like new black where we have more rapping than singing and to me goldlink comes off is just so much more capable of a rapper than a singer and with the song spectrum not a song that I love but it's at least a kind of cool hip house track with a fantastic Missy Elliott sample it actually samples a bit of the track she's a bitch and it's a super catchy and funnily enough actually more you're grabbing than what a lot of gold link is doing on here lyrically but while he's a little monotone his was on point very speedy and impressive the closing track on here just brings more sappy lyrics and nasal just completely off point singing like waiting of that like my mama's house it does nothing for me there's nothing appealing about it he's just not bringing lyrics he's not bringing good singing I don't see the appeal in the really boring skeletal faux jazzy instrumental on this track when this album isn't hard to listen to it's just straight boring there there's maybe one single song here that I think I liked from beginning to end probably the second track the opener was kind of mild though decent and then the album just takes such a fast nosedive and it just seems to go further and further in further downwards I just can't really find anything nice to say about this record I mean consistently uh the song polarized as well I cannot stand the vocals on that track they are awful uh yeah I mean I'm sorry I'm feeling a like a decent - on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it what do you think I should review next and you're the best and hit that like button smash that like and I hope you have a nice day Anthony Fantana goldlink forever 
kH4xS9EFZGE,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and very exciting news i am happy to tell you that this review this review right here this review right here is going to be 100% meme free and kouchuu chesta free as well so for those of you who have been looking for the reviews to take a more serious turn they're gonna be no memes in this video whatsoever no memes at all

allow for my appearance in the reviews so I will say that this review will be 75 i 5% meme free no okay okay alright they will be 80 50 % meme free I am going to review for you this new bus driver project thumbs bus driver is an LA rapper producer Hellfire Club affiliate and he is fresh off of a fantastic full-length album titled perfect hair he's been at it since the 2000s the late 90s but his career in this new decade has seen another sort of wind a fresh breath of air because these recent projects of his have been some of his strangest and most challenging albums like bows and arrows as well as perfect hair like I just mentioned albums where bus driver continues to employ his very odd speedy one-of-a-kind flow and voice but also experimenting with singing into some really off-kilter and strange experimental production so with perfect hair being one of the most electrifying and intergalactic projects and bus drivers catalog thus far what is next for him what is he going to do especially since he's dropping another project over here just to after the release of perfect hair so again this thing is titled thumbs though it is online for sale it has been described to me as a mixtape of sorts and I could definitely see as to why that is the recording on this thing is raw the flow of the songs on this thing it's a bit of a mixed bag I wouldn't say there is as much lyrical and sonic cohesion as there was on perfect hair though I do think stylistically driver seems to be coming from much the same creative headspace and finally another thing about this project is that it's super aggressive at points definitely over the top I think it tries to make up for a lack of finesse with an overabundance of aggression and volume at some points miss me with as I said a lot like with perfect hair on thumbs you're gonna catch a lot of offbeat instrumentals with some jazzy melodies here and there futuristic glitches choppy samples it's a wonder any rapper is spinnin rhymes over any of this stuff much less bus driver but if one rapper was going to it it would be bus driver and of course on this project he continues to bring his really expressive voice his manic flow and there are plenty of highlights to be had especially lyrical highlights right from the start of this thing where bus driver is rapping about on the intro track how the feds are using your phone data for revenge porn I also like left coast rapper zeroes feature on this track as well although overall I would say this song is a kind of a sleepy start to this project the following cut is much more active though and in a way I think kind of a tribute to a historical figure who helped end the slave trade in Britain if not in tribute to him at least a character portrait that is based off of him or in reference to him in some way and that's certainly how the song kind of starts although after a while it sort of seems bus driver goes off in his own lyrical whirl but he does seem to center around a lot of racial issues as he's rhyming he's just not so direct with it a lot of the time and with hyperbolic - this track is so strange to me could be exciting for some bus driver fans but maybe polarizing - to others for me I found the track kind of grating but I have to acknowledge just how over-the-top and aggressive this track is in a way I think bus drivers flows a little Danny Brown inspired which I wouldn't be too surprised by considering Danny's appearance on perfect hair forever I mean obviously driver respects what Danny does in his music and and and going this aggressively which isn't that typical for bus driver at least not as aggressive as this track goes it was definitely interesting seeing him kind of go down that road although I wouldn't say again it was it was all that visceral for me more it was kind of patience testing and that's the thing about bus drivers sometimes I love his eccentricity but I guess it's just a bit of a double-edged sword I am just in awe of I guess how fringe some of his music can sound and actually is but then there are times where he's just gone so far out he's sort of lost me a little bit still though I think the project hits a stride when it hits the song much not only does the track have some really great production behind it but it's this amazing moment on the record where bus driver is equal parts odd and accessible and catchy I love the ear worm chorus on this thing I think you do want to much really great single from this thing and the next song Ministry of the torture couch featuring the frontman of future islands under his his rap name his feature on this track is great there's a nice Beach switch up at one point in this cut and bus driver is focusing on cops police brutality the systemic racism that sort of comes from the law enforcement side of our government the issues of inequality addressed on perfect hair continue to ripple onto this project over here as well also King cookie face that sort of character name that bus driver was throwing onto himself on that last project appears here as well which again is another reason why I don't really see this as as so much its own separate project as much as I do maybe a series of after thoughts maybe not necessarily leftovers like songs that didn't make the cut for perfect hair but maybe bus driver kind of squeezing the last drops of life out of the sounds and ideas and and lyrical concepts that he explored on that album which is mostly why the second half of this project after the very short interlude skit kind of loses me because this is where I think maybe the the least interesting of all the material on this tape ends up I will say before I go on I do love the cut featuring Anderson PAC as well as Milo Anderson's vocals are fantastic on this cut and I love that we're seeing such a great singer appear on all of these not just mainstream underground records as well and it's gonna be interesting with these two new tracks out that he has just had released that are very good what he's going to be doing with his next full-length project and and Milo came on first on that track and it actually instrumentally reminded me of a song off of his cavalcade mixtape seems like it would have fit into that pretty nicely especially with the psychedelic folk vibe going on with the beat and emotionally I think Milo really brought a great verse I mean he was so convincing on this song but the second half of this project is really where it starts to lose me the song featuring Davi Diggs of clipping Fame I was pretty excited to hear this song however I don't really think there was all that much chemistry here and bus driver is just kind of going at millionaires but with a different angle in mind lyrically on this track and and musically and and groove wise on the instrumental to this tracks I am really doing it for me and this is one of the few tracks in the second half here where I feel like the song is so short that it doesn't really bring that much in which is also the case on the track del the funky homosapien appears on on this cut for about one minute and 50 seconds and yeah I mean it's it's it's cool it's a cool change of pace I like del the funky homosapien also in the second half here bus driver indulges in a series of of really fast flows over some obnoxious break beats and really difficult vocal harmonies that are just really hard to digest as well as a song with Jeremiah J which was just incredibly incredibly sleepy as I read into the reasoning behind the album's title I sort of started to feel like it was very fitting because thumbs being this thing that we sort of like and dislike things with that's kind of it was running through my mind on this record I mean half of it was really thumbs up while the other half of it was really just losing me in some ways it almost felt as if a couple of EPS of extra tracks that has been mashed together into one project which if you're a hardcore fan of bus driver is completely fine I have no doubt in my mind the people who have enjoyed perfect air enjoyed bows and arrows and of course enjoy plenty of bus drivers 2000s era stuff will get a lot out of this project and will probably be excited to see him drop another series of tracks but I'm sort of waiting I guess for the next reinvention period because what makes bus driver interesting and exciting to me even through those times when he comes out with releases that I don't care for is I know something different something new something challenging is gonna be around the corner I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why goes to be and what do you think I should review next you're the best Anthony Fantana a bus driver forever 
5RUl-fZU2LQ,the world is going crazy the world is going crazy the world is going crazy the 1ov is going crazy hi everyone Anthony Fan Tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new OneNote Rick's point never album garden of delete OneNote Rick's point never is the most infamous musical pseudonym of electronic and experimental music producer Daniel laputan at one time primarily an ambient electronic music producer a bit of noise and drone as well and believe it or not at one point a vaporwave pioneer how aesthetic a sound that fans thought Daniel had abandoned on his Chuck Pearson project echo jams but he did indulge in it a little bit more on his last full-length album our plus seven there were tons of experimental and ambient electronic music pieces all over this record loaded with very glossy MIDI melodies some of the tracks here were a little short of breath a little underdeveloped I wish they kind of went longer but I appreciated Daniels ability to create an atmosphere create a mood there were some interesting motifs here and even though I didn't love this thing I still loved Daniels will to experiment with something different with each new album him sort of wowing me with his adventurous music production style as originally will won me over on his 2011 album replica a very strange plunder phonics album look up that term and intent and I want to say that this album was simultaneously gentle and relaxing while also being haunting and eerie I didn't really know what to expect from this new album over here honestly because Dan's always doing something different however I guess I did get a hint because I saw a website a really weird website no not pornhub it was this ugly looking gyeo city's looking website that was supposed to be the homepage for a fictional band named chaos edge and the reason this band was invented is because they were supposed to be an influence for Daniel on this album and there is actually chaos edge music on the Internet believe it or not and it's just like really weird noisy glitchy industrial rock music it kind of sounds like listening to Daniel trying to make industrial rock so I expected that sound to manifest itself on this album at some point and it does on a few songs add a few key points although it's it's one of many ideas and sounds and influences that run throughout this record I mean I mean take a number buddy one thing that I can say for sure is the music on this album is abstract it's fractured but it's also very pretty and well composed and melodic and Daniel's love of samples as well as MIDI continues the strange thirty second introduction on this record glides into the very glossy and futuristic no good there's a very serene introduction on this track and then all of a sudden the song bursts into these loud distorted walls of of synths chords that is topped with these really strange glitchy robot vocals that sound like a cross between Kanye West and Daft Punk I wish the track had a grander more ambitious structure to it but it was at least satisfying it was a very cool little experimental composition with a I'm just lost for fucking words on it and this pattern of a strange intro track complemented with a lengthier song repeats on the next couple of songs echo Jam c1 where Daniels vaporwave past is haunting him once again and we hear the echoes calling out I'm still here and then we have the song sticky drama where again more manipulated twisted kind of chipmunk lead vocals and on this track once again just like on no good we have a wall of very heavy chords a myriad of textures some soft some very slick others just rough like a saw blade Daniels compositions on this record are not only dense musically but texturally as well there is a cool little beat switch up in this track and that industrial rock influence I told you about makes itself known with some rolling kick drums on this song that are very fast very aggressive the first time I would probably call Daniel's music visceral the distorted synths on this track actually start resembling guitars at some point there are actually some moments I think toward the end of this album where some guitar sort of presents itself and the song sort of starts and stops and whines and unwinds and detours without rhyme or reason it's pretty insane while the structures and really ambitious it's definitely surprising and kind of unpredictable at points especially as the very melodic and and high-pitched vocals turned to these garbled very Basie roars the music is just really hard to to place it just feels like it's coming from either a different time or a different world another dimension and take a pick things take a very heavy turn on the song s DFK which is kind of a another transitional track a very tense build-up on this song with some booming drums toward the end which glides us into the song mutants standard which is even more intense with these persistent to get a good two ticka ticka ticka ticka rhythm patterns that are as dark as hell I feel like I'm listening to a sci-fi thriller or something like an alien's going to come out of the shadows and stop me the beats eventually give way to this wall of like blinking twanging notes combined with these washes of synthetic tones it's like waves of chords washing over little tiny notes of broken glass and this being the longest track on the record there are numerous phases to this song I mean the music melts it becomes firmer and more defined it eventually goes into a spot that I could only call a hyperdrive in the the last third the faded ending on the song doesn't really do too much for me but it's one of the many spots here where Daniels compositions feel really maximal and overwhelming and I really you like it and that's really just the first half the second half continues to deliver some really great tracks daniel is convincing me on the second half here that he is part man part machine I mean the the compositions feel so calculated but yet have this very wild organic human touch to them evocative sounds and vivid textures and and very strong emotional moods I love the stuttering mechanical tones on the song I bite through it this track is really really prickly there was some mind-bending shit on this track and it just gets heavier and heavier and heavier as it goes along the song freaky eyes sounds soundtrack ready it's got these really weird organ sounding sense in it that are really grand really gothic but eventually it sort of twisted through this really experimental odd abstract digital lens sort of as if this older style of music is very quickly and aggressively being filtered into the modern age the song eventually becomes this distorted drone that is both beautiful and frightening which is maybe a good way to sum this album up in general beautiful and frightening in conclusion I think the record is great I think the the closing track is a little inconclusive and that's the thing about Daniel's music sometimes he seems so focused on doing something so odd and and so strange that he fails to kind of tie it all up in the end in a really kind of cohesive or thematic way a cliffhanger you know that Daniel is never going to really sort of complete or in any kind of way because once his next album comes out he will be on to the next thing and not that I'm asking for that I think this album was really great it has a lot of the aspects that I liked about our plus-7 but a lot of the songs here are pretty satisfying and fleshed out and very progressive and not only that but I found a lot of the compositions here to be really explosive and in-your-face and just maybe Daniels least ambient record yet some spots I thought were kind of harrowing and very freaky maybe even a little Tim Hecker inspired at some points all I know is though I really loved a lot of these tracks individually and they do complement one another in that each track just sort of takes you in another completely unexpected and transcendent place I'm feeling a strong a - a light 9 on this thing Tran City have given this album listen uh-huh did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it what should I review next you're the best forever 
hVjTEGUsl_w,hi everyone Antoine fan Tuan here you know who it is before we get into this review I wanted to tell you in this quick little intro that my next few metal reviews are being sponsored by an up-and-coming YouTube channel started by musician and documentary filmmaker mr. Sam Dunn the channel is banger TV and it features documentaries uncut interviews with some of the biggest names in metal so if you are a metal enthusiast a metal fan a metal head this channel dives into the genre quite deeply many different subgenres explored the mainstream as well as underground artists discussed and you know sort of featured is the word I want to use featured so you can check out the URL to the channel down there in the description and it is also listed right here on the screen right now so check them out you're the best the review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Kailasa album exhausting fire which I swear to you has nothing to do with the Hunger Games series these guys are a Savannah at Georgia rock band and they sit on the heavier side of the spectrum this is their seventh full-length LP and in the 2000s after a series of kind of rough initial releases the band had a pretty nice stride with records like Spiral shadow and static tension and time will fuse it's worth pummeling heavy savage sludge metal records with tons of meaty roofs primal drums and the ferocity that you would expect from a punk album despite the the musicianship and just the the girth and the weight of a metal record not as progressive as Mastodon or as poppy and instantaneously catchy as a band like torch but the psychedelic undertones that work themselves into some of the Bands songs set them apart pretty nicely as well as singer Laura Pleasants movie current-day the band has been having a tough time keeping things exciting in this new decade they had a kind of b-sides that just sort of you know vault track album compilation thing get released the next full-length album they put out sort of embraced those softer more easygoing more psychedelic aspects of the Bands music and it just was not as hard-hitting and didn't really bring that much in in the way of new sounds or ideas to the table obviously the man is trying to redefine themselves in this new decade and not paint themselves into this really aggressive loud booming corner now there are 11 tracks on this thing nothing too long or too short they are continuing to lean on the watery psychedelic layers of guitars that were so prevalent on their last record and also a lot of these very eerie and cleanly sung vocals that are just elongated and beckoning which might seem familiar at this point but I personally think that things have improved on the instrumental side of things the softer and Spacey of rock passages on this record are are a lot more melodic and flavorful definitely more engaging and about as interesting as the crushing riffs that appear on the more aggressive half of this album on that and nothing all too new here but Kyle s is very heavy and and meaty riffs continue to WoW me and at least get my blood pumping but the band really does start to try new things like on the song blood moon we have all these echoed guitars and then all of a sudden these guitars are backed up by what sounds like alto sax or some kind of woodwind or some sort it's actually very pretty and they're really sinister guitars that follow this moment in the song seems like a bit of a doom metal throwback there are actually quite a few subtle spots in the music here that I think are great and and the moments on this record that are heavy they don't always just beat you over the head with their heaviness sometimes there's really a build-up to that of intensity sort of like on the songs out of my mind and night drive and shaping the southern sky the song moving day definitely stood out to me as strange it actually strikes me as kind of a a shoegaze ballad especially with the the very listless light singing that is kind of weaved into the layers of psychedelic heavy jeroni guitars on this track seems like a fusion between really just a sludge metal band and My Bloody Valentine so elements of psychoactive show up here sludge metal old-school doom metal as well as shoe case however I will say the last track kind of lost me it's this really slow and patience testing cover of Black Sabbath's paranoid one of the Bands more visceral tracks but Kailasa decides to play it real slow but I can't really say I cared for this revision honestly musically I think it's a really solid record however like the last album I do have some issues with the vocals the clean singing on this album it's just not that exciting most of the time and it's mixed so low that the guitars are smothering it the vocals just don't really have that much presence and a lot of the time they just seem kind of emotion listen and faint like on the song shaping the southern sky we're on here to me Laura sounds like a slow-motion Debbie Harry though I will say there are exceptions on here I find her singing on the intro track here kind of expressive and sort of bringing that chill that I know her her very eerie vocal delivery is is trying to bring and on the song growing roots the lead and the background vocals it's like Kailasa wanted to put a bunch of vocal tracks into the song but didn't want to bring the space for these vocals so they just kind of mushed together in this really unpleasant way and also is that tambourine in the background in this track is that a freaking tambourine to this track I've not heard a tambourine in in this kind of song before it was it was strange overall though I think there's a lot to like about this record I think guitars and the drums are produced really well I think the riffs are great I think a lot of the guitar leads and the solos are fantastic the performances are nice there's a lot of kinetic energy here the band is toi there are plenty of musical bright spots here and a few risks and and different musical experiments but the vocals just aren't really where they could be I think however it does not ruin the album I'm feeling a light decent seven on this thing transition have you given this tracker to listen if you have did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh brother 
3vJ49F2dVQw,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd nerd guy and it's time for our monthly segment the why you know review where I go through a series of records that I wish I had the time to cover in more depth in a single review this past month but I didn't get a chance to so I'm just talking about all these albums in a gauntlet in this video right here let's ah this record was definitely like some old school by the numbers trustworthy UK style grindcore sounding like a straight out of the 80s and while the instrumentals are totally generic the vocals are one of my favorite things this year sounds just like fuzz number one I just don't know what to say I just don't know what to say I thought fuzz 1 was just okay and this one sounds a lot if not just like fuzz 1 and so I just kind of feel like this one's ok considering the the weird spacey alternative approach that this EP takes R&B along with Arcas production on this I just kind of feel like she's headed in this direction that is just all too fka twigs ish and I like fka twigs but she is nowhere near as strange as fka twigs and that is part of twigs --is appeal so I mean there are a few tracks in here that I think are super catchy and and I think she's come through ironically enough with summer for best material yet didn't really care for her breakout mixtape so I mean I suppose she's headed in the right direction with the with a couple of tracks here that I think are pretty great like rewind good single I like the dreamy aesthetic of this record but the chord progressions and the melodies are just so faint and so drab that this record doesn't really leave that strong of a musical impression on me and even the vocals which I find very pretty and alluring sort of lose their flavor for me after a while as I listen to this entire thing as an album single tracks here and there I find to be very pretty but the whole thing is just really some one-dimensional bedroom spun dream pop this guy is an electronic music producer formerly known as Saint Pepsi who was producing quite a bit of future funk under that name a little vaporwave influence but now he seems to be kind of trending away from that niche style of underground electronic music and doing something a little bit more mainstream under this new name with this new album and there are some killer dance beats on this thing if you're looking for some new danceable electronic music that has very funky aesthetic to a little Daft Punk influenced as well then give this thing a listen this guy is an English rapper embracing a lot of the sounds of pop rap and alternative rap and trap music from the US and I think he comes together with some really artsy instrumentals I mean certainly the production on here is is left-field and and has a strong style to it but lyrically and vocally I'm not really sure I'm that into him as a rapper he's not really all that convincing or exciting of a character to me on record but he's certainly moving in the right direction with this production and if he can just be as envelope-pushing with his lyrics and his flow and his voice I think he will be a much more intriguing artist this album is so rock that it can fuckin be scissors whoa I'm trying over here trying not see write many jokes you lost me the future and this album another project from rob banks another project of his that just I don't know goes over my head and just doesn't really do anything for me I mean I get that he sounds Savage I get that his production sounds real mean real dark but vocally flow wise lyrically he really doesn't stand out to me in any way whatsoever he's not doing anything lyrically that to me seems unique or interesting or or I really don't know just there's no bars of his there's no quotables of his that just really stick out to me I get that he sounds mean I get that his music sounds dark again but beyond that he's really not delivering much I'm still trying to figure out whether this or the new Gio Gio record was more disappointing most definitely respect to Janet on this record I think she as an older pop artist probably was feeling a lot of pressure to make concessions toward more mainstream and more modern sounds and production styles on this record and I think in a lot of ways she didn't give in especially when it comes to the vocal side of this record I think there are actually some moments where she's singing in such a way where it's really tributing her her brother however there are some tracks on here where I think the songwriting as well as the production either is subpar or just really doesn't fit her voice and her style I mean one track in particular actually is kind of a driving EDM sort of style kick behind it that sort of builds up into this really synthetic chorus that just really does not fit her at all it just really kind of feels like a grab to sort of pull through with a song that just has a pop appeal to it this record to me was really a mixed bag and just too often showed Janet just not really playing to her strengths oh man Oh buddy they have done it again and by done it again I mean done exactly what you expected them to do again this was blank and this EP was some pretty mildly stimulating experimental hard-nosed left-field techno that is incredibly out there maybe so much where I wasn't really getting as much out of it as I would have liked but if you are looking for some supremely strange electronic music that is very cold is very calculated is very this is weird shut up then give this thing a listen ashin have you given any of these albums a listen and if you have did you enjoy them a lot more than I did most likely most likely but that's fine world's still turning and anything here that you haven't heard I encourage you to you know check it out for yourself and just sort of see what's going on and that's it Anthony Fantana mmmmmm um uh music 
bRDENHaT2lI,ah hi everyone shave theny soon tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Grimes album art angels wholegrains be nice Anthony be nice to Grimes don't be mean don't be mean to old Grimes II make sure you're nice to the Grimes shop Branagh rhymes is a Montreal pop singer and producer who had a meteoric rise to fame a few years ago off the back of her full-length album visions it was almost as if she had come out of nowhere really she went from relative underground experimental pop obscurity to millions of hits on some of the biggest singles from this album like the song oblivion as well as widespread critical acclaim for this album however I personally not enjoy this album the washed-out production and the really high-pitched nasal vocals and the incredibly rudimentary vocal melodies and and keyboards just weren't really doing all that much for me the record really felt kind of one-dimensional and at this point that feels like it came out so long ago which is odd but I think it mostly has to do with the fact that these past three years have been so silent for grime she has been putting out any EPS or anything like that we did have the go single which it seemed like there was a lot of negative reactions to unfortunately and from what I've read in between now and and visions that was actually even in albums worth of material that had been thrown away we also did have a demo version of the song reality which I liked a lot I think that's a great single we have a sort of studio version appearing on this album outside of that Grimes has really kept things about this album under wraps now I wouldn't say I went into this album excited mostly because I didn't really dig the singles leading up to the release of this LP all that much we have the song flesh without blood which for me was just kind of this really trashy radio-friendly pop rock tune sounded really Charli XCX inspired and the song scream was a total train wreck between its whistles and redundant beat and rapid-fire Taiwanese rapping at least what I assume is Taiwanese rapping from a underground rapper by the name of Aristophanes so yeah admittedly I did not go into this record with the highest of hopes however the intro really caught me off guard the kind of orchestral electronics on this track I thought were stunningly beautiful in what I imagined or assumed or some organic instrumentation in there as well the strings whether they're being bowed or plucked just sound really gorgeous and Grymes very high pitched singing fits in really well with the instrumentation the track doesn't really give us a taste of what's to come on the record but it at least shows that Grymes abilities sit outside of just the lo-fi bedroom pop that we're used to now despite this promising intro I will say I think the first third of this record is a mess the song California which I like it's very peppy beat and how sunny the song is and its really persistent handclaps but this track easily has the worst lyrics on the entire record and the song belly of the beat it's not bad but it's kind of bland sort of seems like a slightly cleaner version of what Grimes had already been known for doing on her last length LP doesn't really feel like a progression of any kind like many of the other songs on here do however once past this point the album gets instantaneously great abs deserve Lou is a total banger I like the driving rhythm guitars on this track Grimes vocals on these verses are super sassy a lot of personality there are moments on the song where she's like screaming like an animal which is actually kind of refreshing and the the pre-chorus to the song sort of takes this a cheerleader chant that's really catchy and then all of a sudden once that hook busting the yelping vocals that she does are actually fantastic it's a really energetic fun eclectic pop song with just a booming beat and a lot of personality and I think the good writing and the personality continues on to the next track here the title track where Grimes pulls heavily from ray of light era Madonna the instrumental is completely blissful with a persistent kick drum is a really strong dance beat and on top of it a really snappy guitar loop manage manage but she sort of puts her own spin on the sound with all these weird eclectic electronic edits and really breathy vocal harmonies I love the tune alive the song easily is an OK tune this little piano track seems a little Enya inspired I think not one of the better songs on the record but sonically it is very chill it is very serene and I guess it's a nice instrumental change of pace from what's on the rest of the album but following this tracks like pin we have more pop bangers here I mean to me this track is like bubblegum dipped in LSD it's psychedelic and insanely catchy and the song reality I actually kind of like this newer version I think the the older version was a little roar it was it was cooler but this newer instrumental that backs the song isn't really that bad sort of reminds me of Crystal Castles debut record in a good way and Grimes still of course you know has a strong song at the core of this cut just like I already knew was there because the the song reality originally in the demo version was great and again this is one of the many tracks here where the influence of 90s dance pop just continues to ripple on this album very tastefully and the song venus fly with janelle monae another highlight on this record for me a really great fun bombastic and eclectic dance tune I wish Monet's and as well Grimes vocals were a little louder on this track sometimes I can't exactly tell who is who or what even exactly is being said though I will say on this album in general the vocals are way more audible than they were on visions and despite the vocals being a little a wash and reverb sometimes I still think these songs hold a lot of character Grimes is turning the world of pop music on its head with a lot of these songs I think this track specifically where it sounds kind of like a fusion of Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation and some Spice Girl anthems plus a few mi a style refrains and some Diplo sized bass and the songs world princess in the closing track two are a little more easygoing bubbly lighter and just have sunnier melodies and album definitely needed it at this point because while a lot of these dance tracks are great I think they're a little syrupy a little darker and I think these two tracks are are kind of friendlier more tangible while I can't say I loved this record I liked it a lot and I think it was a really great improvement for Grimes I mean I think she's written better songs here I think she's got better production here I think she's taken more risks she's really diversifying her sound some of the experiments and some of the tracks here I don't think go over well specifically in the first third here where this album's Poppaea stuff and it's weirdest stuff show up however the rest of the material that sort of lands between that spectrum in the second half of the album or in at least the last two thirds of the album specifically I think consistently is great all I can say is that I hope the rest of her fan base takes to the record as well because I think there's definitely a brighter future in the sort of accessible but very left-field pop music that she's producing on this record I'm feeling a deist of strong sevit on this thing transition have you given this record to listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next what would you like for me to review after this review and I hope you have a nice day Anthony Fantana Grimes our angels forever

Matthew wendice we're gonna be having a discussion about the current state of music writing music journalism and I guess would you characterize yourself as a bit of a a grammar nazi of sorts not so much a grammar nazi' I try to steer clear of that because I don't know everything there is to know about grammar so sure someone who does is likely to criticize me and that's true my to minimize that I guess you're a grammar stickler I'm trying to think of the less extreme version cuz obviously you're not going stigler's okay he's a bit of a grammar stickler and maybe under sort of false assumptions I invited him on to this show thinking that I would I would not feel his wrath because my videos are in video form so I might just be sidestepping that entirely because while Matthew does seem to have a very kind and polite demeanor about him so far because I talked with him a little bit before I started recording this podcast his reviews of other people's reviews are absolutely scathing a lot of the time so I'm wondering if we're gonna see that wrath in the midst of this conversation we'll see Matthew how are you doing I'm doing quite well Anthony how are you I'm great I'm great thanks for coming on no problem alright so what exactly let's let's just get a bit of background here you you've been running this website for or sort of running rip for crypt work has been a thing since about the same year I started the needle drop you know and obviously I know my reasons for starting what I was doing but but what was kind of you know making you tick when you decided to undergo building this website and doing what you do well it was an interesting time in my mid-20s and I was thinking to myself okay I I'm tired of writing for other people I kind of want to start my own blog but the problem was that there were a million music blogs out there already so I'm thinking to myself what can I do that's really original I thought to myself okay what if I make a website or a blog that's dedicated entirely to critiquing music critics and I I mean people have been doing that already but I was thinking about the way to do it in terms of a tone just being like oh man your opinion of such-and-such now I'm is crap it's actually a good album I was thinking to myself well what if I take on the persona of kind of militant middle school high school English teacher and just savage the art of the critic which is writing and that's uh kind of how it took root yeah because your reviews don't so much seem like an ideological battle of which music is bad in which music is good more you are just kind of attacking the quality of the writing that you're seeing exactly because if I I found that if you do that then the writer the critic can just fall back on oh well it's just my opinion everybody is entitled to their opinion and your opinions no better than my bla bla bla bla so yeah that it's kind of a circular argument and I felt that was going nowhere sure absolutely yeah that that opinion or that point of view can kind of snuff that argument out pretty quickly but the approach that you're taking with the website and have been taking with the website do you find that you elicit a stronger response from music fans fellow music writers when you kind of discuss music critique in this way I think so yeah because the way I write it I write it directly to the critic almost like I'm addressing them just on a phone call or a letter by their first name i I've always hated using last names especially in music reviews where it's just so impersonal it's like they're writing about politics which is kind of ridiculous when you think about it so sure just taking on like a more personal tone I think both puts them on their heels because it's someone who's actually directly challenging them but it also appeals to people who are looking for more of a human face in the writing sure but uh but have you found or has it kind of been your experience in the past that are you eliciting you know serious and and maybe even offended or angry responses from some of these writers after you put out the reviews that you do you'd be surprised it actually runs the gamut some people are actually they taken its tried they think it's funny and they had some people actually thanked me for like taking them to task and they just honestly hadn't thought of things that way but on the other end of the spectrum there are people who have taken great personal offense and that isn't without justification definitely early on I was much more scathing much more of a dick you softened yes because I figure that I mean being a dick is easy especially today but if you just ease off of that and you just focus on the arguments and being respectful even offering feedback and things that they could change and possibly improve at least in my mind but doing it in more respectful congenial manner at least compared to my old days and I think that gets a better response but there are plenty of people out there who just it's fight and we aren't open to criticism being critics themselves I mean I've been blocked it trigger blocked on Twitter I don't know how many times by mostly pitchfork writers but it's it's just funny to me that there's that level of closed mindedness in the community the the time that you were starting this website you know you're talking about how is an interesting time for you personally and you can go into that as to why that was if you like but it was also an interesting time just kind of for the internet and for music because there was a huge boom of music blogs from all across the world that we're talking about indie bands of all sorts of different sounds and flavors but that sort of seems to is a that seems to have died out a bit with the come up of all of these music streaming services it seems that now that there are more music streaming services and more people are kind of gravitating toward those services to hear new music the blog is a lot of these smaller indie blogs have kind of lost purpose in a sense and and as a result you've got kind of a lot of dead blogs and all just blogs that just start functioning just aren't updated anymore and it kind of seems like things have fallen back upon the major players who were there before all of this I mean certainly some websites have kind of risen to the top and have thrived throughout this this era you know like consequence of sound and the 405 tiny mixtapes as well who I think is actually pretty old I also want to say Stereogum as well do you sort of take issue with the writing on a lot of those websites as well you know just kind of the general news blurbs that they're putting up and that sort of thing not necessarily I mean it's it's funny because part of the biggest thing that I rail against when I'm writing is against this kind of robotic like fake erudite tone that people take and just kind of like commodify music whereas a lot of the smaller guys I've found have injected a more personal tone into the writing and it just gives the impression that they love what they do they love what they listen to and they don't love what they don't and that's fine but I mean a lot of people I guess are doing it as a hobby and there's not a ton of money in it anymore if there ever was so plus we see with the like acquisition of pitchfork by condé Nast's lately a lot of these bigger ones are coming back but they're also being subsumed in these much bigger companies so it's it's definitely changed since when I first started out in 2009 but there's still plenty of variation out there for people are willing to look yeah and this current or this recent rather buy out that Conde Nast had with pitchfork this acquisition as far as you've been observing and I know that you've been reviewing you just reviewed that a Vanessa Carlton record that they reviewed or at least you reviewed the review of it sort of watching them as closely as I'm assuming you do have you sort of noticed any kind of shift in the writing style or the quality as far as what pitchfork has been putting out after this acquisition and sort of leading up to the point of this acquisition because I'm sure it's not the first time they've they've been in contact and sort of you know had kind of uh put the idea out there that you know this acquisition could take place I mean I think now it's too early to say and I've seen some things like I've seen the word I and me pop up in pitchfork reviews lately which I don't know if that has anything to do with it or if it's just like a freak occurrence but I think generally over the past few years pitchfork has been trying to remould its image away from this kind of clique of snooty mostly men and inject a much more diverse palette of writers onto the roster regardless of whether or not they write any differently is I mean that's a up in the air for debate but yeah it's to me pitchfork has slowly been evolving into just something that's very business driven I mean you can see it in their reviews just the amount of hyper linking within the website it's almost like they don't care what their writers are writing so long as there's enough crap in there to just click further into the site so it's honestly it's hard to tell I think when it really changes is the day that I find that I have not much to write about so I'll let you know when that happens and when you say changes do you mean changes for the better or changes in into such a way it becomes like really banal and just completely boring and then there's really nothing of substance being said well it's interesting to me because I've seen a lot of talk on Twitter people are like oh my god it's gonna become rolling stone and like I mean well honestly I think a little bit of Rolling Stone and pitchfork wouldn't be the end of the world but it's really a question of what you like and there are definitely people out there who like what pitchfork produces I'm not one of them but I guess time will tell it's really I'm not sure what the higher-ups are gonna try to create in order to garner the higher market these believe they termed it millennial males so we'll uh we'll see well it also kind of sounds like even though you are critiquing the reviews on the website and I and I would like to get a little bit back into that later you you you have opinions about the way that we're at the website runs outside of just kind of simply the the writing end of things you're talking about sort of the the business end of things and how it looks like the the website is running from the outside and just kind of these a recent pushes toward diversity that they've been making you know do you think that this diversity that you're seeing in the writing staff as well as writing reviews that that are using I and using me might be a little more personal in tone do you think this is for the better or do you think it's just kind of a bit of lip service or window dressing well I don't think it's just window dressing I do think it's good to have a diversity of voice and tone but I mean that still remains to be seen I mean a lot of writers new writers that I've started reading on pitchfork honestly I could just pull out of a hat of anybody I've read over the past few years but there are some new voices on it that that's another thing the way I write I don't force the issue so if I find that someone's review is I find it unobjectionable or fine then I don't try to pry into it I mean people might think otherwise but I'm not some vindictive cretin who just enjoys like savaging certain pitchfork writers just for the hell of it I mean I have my idea of what I like and what I don't like but I don't consider myself a you have a soul I have a soul contrary to popular belief I got it all right so I mean as far as what you're seeing in these reviews and what you're ripping apart in these reviews and this isn't just you know specific to pitchfork you know you just music reviews in general what is it I guess would be one of the biggest and most major pet peeves to you you know the first thing that kind of ticks you off to uh-oh this is going to be horribly written well I just in general I think it's people writing without a reader in mind I think this happens when people listen to music and they just think to themselves like oh I have this great idea in my head of what this sounds like I'm just gonna scribble it down and I'm not gonna actually read it and think to myself Oh does this read well does this flow well the ant if it answers the question does it sum up the collection of sounds I just listen to then it's ready to go and from there flows any number of ridiculous things you can find in a lot of music reviews I think one of my biggest pet peeves as people know who read rip fork would be the excessive hyphenation which just gets to the extent where it looks like you're reading 19th century Telegraph dispatches where it's I feel like I should just be like snapping my fingers when I'm reading this or like counting out beats it just and the sentence is a run-on sentences with parentheses and quotes where they don't need to go and it's just I just if you read your stuff this shouldn't happen I just it boggles my mind sometimes how this stuff can even pass through and I understand a lot of these sites don't have editors or proof readers on staff it's just the people send in their work and is posed on the site but there should be some quality control starting with the freelancers themselves III think um I don't know I get writing like that it can be kind of messy but it can also be sort of I don't know animalistic and just sort of I I guess there can be a kind of indie appeal to it as well you know we're breaking the rules of punctuation just as just as we sort of endorsed these artists who are kind of breaking the rules of popular music I guess there fair enough but I also to that I would say it's also kind of leaning in the direction of perversion of language where it's to me in a lot of cases it's just a sign of laziness where it's a lot easier to come up with a chain of five words to describe something that it is to really like delve into your mind with a source into a dictionary and find that one word that just encapsulate what you just heard and I think that can be a much more rewarding experience sure absolutely listen listening to you speak so far in the podcast you're very articulate you're very well-spoken you speak very evenly it doesn't sound like you're trying to fill up a lot of dead space like I do when I'm talking and that you don't have a million different sentences flowing through your head at once even though you know that there's one that you want to say so as a result of that I have to ask would you consider yourself kind of a language purist in a sense do you avoid things like slang or when you hear things like that yeah do you normally have a negative reaction whether it comes up in just regular speaking or in writing well interestingly enough my work for the past greater part of a decade has been in transcription closed captioning adit increased rips so really I spend the bulk of my time listening to people talk and so you learn how to construct sentences on the fly how to punctuate them on the fly good speakers speakers you speak and run-on sentences because we were a concise and snappy easy to type and I think that's just being able to think in terms of sentence structure is kind of a blessing and a curse in that respect but that's that's kind of how I tick okay is would you say that this I guess work that you're doing it's probably the biggest influence on unsorted how you perceive language and how you know your just like you're speaking to me right now you know her has has language kind of been a bit of a lifelong passion for you well I I'd like to think I've been speaking from a very young age but that's true I've always I've always had a distaste for jargon just for the sake of jargon I mean to me if you have something to say you can certainly be poetic and beautiful and saying it but it says to me if you just cram it full of unnecessary words that either a you don't really have something to say B you don't believe in what you say or C you're not trying hard enough to find an effective way of saying it well it's been that or couldn't that be a critique of a lot of the music reviews that you're reading that maybe they're so soaked in slang or kind of terminology that's so specific to the niche genre music that the album is dealing in that people who don't already go into that review familiar with the artists familiar with the type of music that the artist is playing the review can be a little alienating because I know that's that's something that's I'm diff excuse me I'm guilty of occasionally because sometimes I'm reviewing let's say a death metal record or a post-rock record and I want to do the review but don't necessarily have the time to kind of give people a crash course on that stuff so they're probably some descriptive go to terms for the type of musical characteristics that I'll catch in the genre and I'll bring it up and it's it's just kind of easy though I guess in a sense it does sort of make me lazy because I remember there was one point maybe in 2012 or 2013 probably more 2013 where me saying because I was just reviewing so many new hip-hop albums and at that point you know trap had just really taken the world by storm and it just became a thing we're just pretty much in every review for a little while I was saying trap influence beats traffic booby trap influence beats traps influence beats and it kind of became a mini meme in and of itself and like hey man take a drink every single time he hit the Fantas trap influence beats and it's still kind of chases me now even though you know I do avoid the term more consciously than I used to but uh but still I can't help but feel like at least a little bit of jargon helps and sort of can be necessary sometimes I I I don't have a problem with people being passionate about what they do and I hear what you're saying about a lot of this stuff is like seven levels deep and in order to properly explain something to an audience then you need to delve into it but I think by the same token you should also not fall into the trap of thinking that my own audience should only be people who already know the solid foundation of this and I'm speaking to my peers because I think that can be really alienated and I think what turns off a lot of people from pitchfork especially is just that kind of artificial bar for entry where they're the tone that's taken is this is our exclusive clubhouse if you know what the hell I'm talking about then you're welcome to come in and enjoy what I enjoy or not enjoy what I don't enjoy but the rest of you if you think this is over your head then you can just scurry along to listen to some Nickelback sure and and talking about a sort of the audience that you have in mind for when you're writing something and and this is something that you brought up earlier and and that's something I sort of take issue with as well when you're getting on your initial point about that it seems like there are a lot of music reviewers out there who are writing but seem as if only if they're kind of writing for themselves is not really considering their writing is kind of a communication tool they're not really thinking of a group of people reading what they've written I guess in a very sort of intimate way I mean when I'm doing my reviews I try to write and try to voice them in such a way that I would if I were speaking to maybe a small group of like a hundred people or something it doesn't seem like that same sort of wish to eunuch eight comes through and a lot of reviews that I read on more popular websites they read more like I don't know the something that somebody might just kind of keep in their own head without worrying about whether or not it translates to how other people might interpret it and on top of that maybe even reads a little bit like a uh a report you might hand in to a teacher which I think isn't entirely the fault of the writer I think that's kind of a a way that we're sort of stuck into writing or I guess a mindset that we're kind of frozen and a lot of you know Western writers you know younger people are frozen in because that's kind of the way we've been raised to write in the school system I know what you mean and I think well people who start out with music writing a majority of them come out of college having written like one or two three essays a week where they have to write this way otherwise they get penalized for it taking the congenial down-to-earth tone will get you points docked unless you have a very understanding professor but by the same token this is music and it's something that apparently you're supposed to enjoy and love and have define your life and just making it sound like a chore and writing for the internet just seems silly to me that like why would people choose to do this unless they're their editors and their higher-ups are forcing them to do it and that would raise the question why is that being done why why does this style of writing sell why is this the norm especially now when you're going up against the robots essentially with Spotify and Pandora when people don't need to read the reams of jargon they can just plug in a band they like and they'll get different bands bit right back out at them that they statistically will enjoy according to an algorithm hmm but I think um well while that is true I also think you know that there definitely needs to kind of be a place where people can talk about some of these up-and-coming bands that aren't necessarily picked up by these algorithms just yet and also in addition to that I mean I don't know do you kind of have faith in the evolution of algorithms to do such a point where you know it'll be almost as if you're being recommended music with a human touch I guess because I mean I had I know me personally a lot of these recommendation engines on a lot of these different music streaming platforms I've been utterly disappointed with all of them however I know not you know I know I'm not the average music listener you know I mean the only thing that's really come close to impressing me are some of the pretty eclectic playlists that have turned up on Apple music but you know really that's about it well I certainly hope we don't reach the point where the machines can essentially do the complete job of humans because that kind of brings us to the point like okay do we even need writers anymore and if that's the case then I'm out of a job and thousands of other desperate people are out of a job too but I think that people should at the very least bear in mind that I think companies are pushing towards that to try and I mean they're not idiots they're trying to get as many clicks as they can and if people have a voice and have a love for music and want to convey that to the world and I think they also need to be open to the idea that there are better and stronger and brain farts yes better stronger ways of accomplishing that if we were to get to that point where the algorithms were that fantastic you know and they were that great I can't help but feel like even if people were getting music that they felt like they really really liked out of those algorithms that there would still be something missing if they we're to simply rely on that to introduce them to new music and kind of experience the music world because the music world is so cultural and it's just so much about you know what our friends and what our family are enjoying and what they have enjoyed it's it's just you know the music is such a personal thing I don't think that the experience can just simply kind of be boiled down to I heard of all these songs through my web browser and I love them all and they defined my teenage years you know I mean maybe it's not as romantic as listening to music on the radio or the way that we romanticize radio in the past I mean radio for a while now has been total crap and I feel bad for anybody who's teen years are being defined by the radio right now yeah New England radio man it's uh it's kind of a bismal now that I've returned home oh are you from New England as well originally from Connecticut just like you oh wow fantastic yes when you were here last was WCCC still a metal station is that WCCC was the metal station 106.9 out of Hartford Oh Hartford oh I was I was a WAF guy at least in my younger angrier years I don't think I've even tried listening to them anymore it was it was mostly like new metal and stuff like that and Howard Stern yeah and Howard Stern actually got his start over there way back in the day but recently as recently as a few years ago they've been bought out by a Christian station that just kind of syndicates the same programming across every other station that they own sure so it's a lot of lovely Christian rock blasting throughout the day but it's music it's not uh not the word being being preached probably some points of the day where you can hear the word down in expand my horizons have you ever listened to WP KN wpan probably not I don't really listen to a whole ton of radio growing up so you probably know much more than me I mean I do have a background in radio so that would hum that would help that would help but yeah WP KNI is still a pretty great community station where I remember pretty pretty consistently throughout high school a friend of mine and I would tape episodes of a particular show and and the show would air once a month and that was how that was how busy they were I guess just how flooded they were with people requesting shows but people would just pretty much just have a show once a month and he would be playing from maybe midnight or 11 o'clock to like 3 a.m. or something and be playing nothing but just the the vilest nastiest hardcore punk and stuff like that like it was the first time we'd ever heard of anybody like GG Allin it's you know he was playing his stuff on the radio and stuff you brought your innards with and exactly rinse exactly so he was just playing nothing but that stuff and we were just like tape the shows and learn about all the terrible artists he was playing all the time this is a it was fantastic time and Anthony Fantana was born and the Anthony Fantana was born yeah I mean you know punk punk music really ruined my life honestly I mean if I had never heard of it I probably just would have continued on into life of Accountancy ah that would be uh that would be an interesting parallel reality going there a very boring parallel but you know whatever not not dissing any accountants I have I have relatives who are so it just kind of seemed like it made sense as upon CPAs out there offended oh my god there was a and and now we're just kind of digressing into personal stories here but I remember I at one time in high school I had gone to this career day thing and one of the career I want to say mentors who I had chosen that I wanted to sort of see speak because you had a whole array of people you could choose from was a CPA and it was it was actually very sad yeah I I went into it you know with with high hopes and I was very positive about the whole thing and I was kind of excited to you know legitimately excited to kind of hear people who were in the workforce kind of talked about their work because even as a kid I was very excited to kind of you know grow up and become an adult and you know just be making money and just kind of building a life or whatever and he went up there he was talking about his job and I don't know what it was he just made his job sound so painfully boring and and and and the whole class you know it wasn't even just him like the whole class like revolted against him in a sense and they started questioning his life choices of Jesus and the bottles I I wasn't even saying anything it was everybody else it was crazy they just like you know where it's it's like they just smelled blood like they could they could smell like a little bit of insecurity and what he was saying and then they started like you know pickin at him with little questions and then all of a sudden they had him kind of in a corner and he said he said well would you rather do something that you like or something that makes money and everybody was like I'd rather do something I like j-lo's both is the correct answer and and and I think the the point at which I think he really lost everybody was a point at which and and this could I think had been sold with a cool angle and and I don't think it's like you know a terribly uncool thing but he told this story about how in his work he's actually at a pointer was at a point where he worked pretty closely with the FBI pursuing some people who had committed white-collar crime and you know they would hand him the books and you know be like so you know do you see any evidence of any wrongdoing here and I guess in one particular instance they allowed him to come with them on a bust of one of these guys okay so in the midst of getting ready for the bus they handed him a gun but it was unloaded so that he could kind of have a prop gun when everyone went in there to fuckin bust the place he knew it wasn't loaded he was told it was not loaded you know he should not be if he's not trained he shouldn't just have a loaded gun and and now sorted enough now sort of in the age of I don't know the police militarization and all that it seems kind of disturbing but yeah exactly but uh but at the time everyone in class thought it was hilarious that his gun was not loaded and just like thought it was so dorky and emasculating that they would hand him this unloaded gun to charge into this room with like I don't know maybe he had before five other guys or ten other guys I don't know how many people bust into a room to bustah somebody who's like I don't know embezzling money whatever the guy was doing and yeah that was just one of many points where everybody had decided wow man I don't want to do this at all this guy's like super disappointing he was very very much an unmotivated speaker that's true that's very true so yeah having said all that I also had a class with somebody who worked in radio and and and he was actually very inspiring and that's sort of where I sort of set my sights I was like yeah broadcast stuff that sounds more fun than being handed an empty gun yes exactly exactly so yeah we've just fallen so off-course alright but moving on from that I wanted to ask you um moving forward do you think music writing is going to continue to - I don't know even be a thing or sort of hold any water and not even in the wake of these music streaming websites but in the wake of what stuff the stuff like what I'm doing you know and other people out there on YouTube as well who are doing these video reviews because if the goal is to kind of be personal connect with the reader and sort of recommend them something in such a way where it feels like it's coming from one person to another not some algorithm not just a block of text it seems at least to me hopping on camera is is the most personal way to go about it I think so too and I'm not I'm not discounting music writing I'm not holding a torch and a pitchfork and saying death - music writing and this this should just be destroyed I might have thought something along those lines very early on but I I love it when people write about what they love and I just think that it doesn't come through for a lot of people for any number of reasons and I I think that what you do with the video blogging about music is a great step in the right direction because you can't really fake your personality when there's a camera in your face so and I mean what you were saying earlier you were hoping I'm not gonna critique you well I was thinking about that earlier and it would be pretty it would be impossible for me to do it because essentially I would be kicking your your performance I would be like oh you you push your glasses up your nose too much that is a valid critique though I was thinking that actually that I would bring that up might need to uh tighten the screws on those they're just lying down just a dead I probably do yeah it's true but I mean it's again that's nitpicking outside of my wheelhouse which I feel is writing and again I don't want to toot my horn saying I'm the bed writer I'm the best editor I know this I know everything but I do know what sounds better than other things what reads better than other things and I'm really not gonna discount that I definitely have a voice I have an opinion and I think it's valid ya know I mean it's I guess some I guess I've just been disappointed with the lot of the current crop of not only music writers but just kind of journalists in general and and it's it's really I think no fault of any one person or any one editor or anything like that I mean I think the trend that's sort of slowly killing a lot of this stuff has more economic than anything you know I think unfortunately just a lot of these news websites as the Internet has sort of swallowed up a lot of print media and so on and so forth a lot of the journalism has sort of gone down the toilet I mean I was just watching something yesterday on um you know all of this native advertising that that people are trying to work into news websites now where it's just something that's essentially an advertisement but it looks like news and and I've had dozens of people email me over the years asking me if I can have them advertise on my site and you know I'm gonna say to them okay sure you know what's what's the advertisement and they're like oh well it's an article it's already written out or you know we you could write the article and you know here's all the things you need to say in it and then once you put it up on the website you will get X amount of dollars and thankfully I'm in a position with YouTube where I can just be like no like this is fuckin crazy are other people doing this you know it's it's actually kind of scary just how stealthily people are trying to sneak advertisements into our information now I know Jimmy and now that you bring it up I I hate the trend towards clickbait II articles and that kind of just headline journalism and yeah because it seems like you're either getting one or the other you're getting the Navy you're getting the native advertising thing or you're getting that clickbait stuff or you're getting stuff that it seems like the the author is writing it and this might be one of the only few times where it seems the author does have an audience in mind pissed-off people the the author is just writing something because they know it's gonna make somebody mad and I mean I know where people are coming from I know where freelancers are nowadays just the dearth of work the dearth of good-paying work I mean good-paying projects are few and far between and just the trend towards clickbait is reflective of economics but it's also people just under pressure just to get a voice get an audience and get revenue trying to do what they love to do and get paid for it is just getting harder and harder and it's really sad that really the trend that I've been seeing is just towards a lot more divisive articles just for the point of being divisive and just getting people to slug it out and it's it's sad and of course I'm a hypocrite in that respect too I mean like I'm divisive and what I write but but I guess it's kind of divisive in such a way where at the end of the day you could sort of have a bit of a giggle with it or think that it's sort of interesting that somebody would sort of take a particular aspect of music writing so seriously or dive so hard into something so much that they would you know write something so scathing you're not really you're not really drawing a line in the sand where there are thousands of people on one side and thousands of people on the other side I mean the interesting and the funny thing about what you're doing is you're drawing a line in the sand and the only person on the other side is you yes you know and whoever wants to be we have nice things on my side but but some of these other articles I mean you well know that they're drawing lines in the sand between large groups of people and you know that they're trying to create these these ideological battles I mean I think maybe one of the most notable ones off of pitch work maybe earlier this year I believe is when it happened was was that article about how painfully white Indy was that's quite vividly which was absolutely hilarious for a number of reasons I mean one I mean it's it's not by design you know nobody nobody's forcing or trying to make indeed white you know I mean in Indy first and foremost is is about the indie musicians you know and and it's about the type of music that they're playing and I mean just historically it's been white people who have been wanting to play it you know and and and I mean who who could blame people of other cultures in especially in America for not being that interested in it because it's such a niche thing number one and number two it's been so underground for so long you know I mean a lot of these people in the indie scene partially come from places of privilege and they can kind of afford to play this type of music that makes absolutely no money you know or very little money you know whereas you might have people from other backgrounds who who probably want to play pop music or want to play music that is probably going to register with a larger audience you know they want to play this sort of experimental obscure sort of trying hard to impress people intellectually type of music and and and that's not to say that there haven't been people of color who have been very successful in Indy there most certainly have and people outside the genre who play other styles of music who for whatever reason maybe they're a little left-field they've been kind of rejected by people who would typically listen to that kind of music but the indie scene has embraced them so uh you know I I feel like um it just kind of seemed as you were saying earlier divisive and just trying to you know create a battle where there isn't one I mean obviously the indie scene and perfect you know just like any culture isn't perfect I mean you know it has its issues that need to be ironed out you know we talk especially in articles like this about things like privilege but consistently we do not talk about things like class privilege because if we were people who have certain economic backgrounds would have to raise their hands me like yeah actually I'm very rich you know or I don't need to worry about you know where I'm getting my next paycheck well I think that was the problem I had with that article too is that it didn't really delve into much of anything other than white equals bad which I thought was kind of a dumb argument to begin with but the examples that were used in it I mean like Bono Taylor Swift Miley Cyrus Kanye West I mean none of these people are indie and it depends on what you're talking about I mean what is indeed these days is it the Belle and Sebastian of yesteryear or I mean what is it today but I just thought it was a very crude poorly worded and poorly written poorly argued article that was appearing on a website for for all intents and purposes from what I could see was just to garner clicks an outrage on Twitter which it certainly got but at what a cost yeah I mean and also I think the the article kind of in a way expressed a bit of completely ignorant American privilege because I think to sort of single out a band like balance of Astron is to completely ignore and erase the existence of Scottish culture and a lot of the underground rock culture of the UK which was a very I think something that was very specific to the culture of the UK whereas when you're from America you can kind of take it for granted that you live in a place where culture is kind of this amorphous thing and you know it doesn't really matter what race you are and a lot of respects as far as enjoying particular things or finding certain kinds of music entertaining I mean it's a little bit of a melting pot I mean sure you have your pockets everywhere where certain cultures kind of congregate but as far as mainstream culture there just like so many influences coming together in all directions and you know you have people in America who are essentially white but you know they have these different specific European backgrounds but nobody really kind of draws on that once you're in America you know everybody who's who's Caucasian is just white you know like nobody's really identifying simply as I guess their European heritage if you do happen to be white so again it's a bit of a melting pot and you can kind of take for granted that a white person here is just like a white person in Scotland and that's not the case yeah well that was another reason I was so disappointed because the article was actually written by someone who I believe lives in England and she was a passed out dissent but it was just written in a way that like you could have read this on any other clickbait article about like cultural appropriation and just kind of the very rough hewn arguments that kind of hit with a big hammered but don't really probe any deeper than that and everybody ends up getting annoyed and irritated and defensive or supportive of it but for reasons that I think are just not very nuanced and when you think about it music like you were saying is just such a great melting pot and it's so varied and do we really want to be policing people for just liking what they like and injecting what they like into their music and the motivation and the execution can certainly be called into question but I don't think we should really throw blanket statements about that like the unbearable whiteness of indie or something like that it just to me it just begs the question of why pitchfork even ran that article to begin with yeah I mean it's it's just kind of sad to see not only them but also a lot of other websites out there taking this kind of I guess editorial style with their opinion pieces that you know originally could find on websites like BuzzFeed and the reason these pieces would go up you know with not even just writing you know also um you know some of their weird lists where they would just throw pictures up pieces on their website where it's like these 25 women need feminism and then the next article is BAM these 25 women don't need feminism exactly these 25 cats wearing wearing overalls don't need feminism you know like that kind of shit and and the thing is it's it's it's it's an article style that was created just to drive traffic and just to get people pissed off you know not to educate people inform people enlighten anybody and it's this cheap kind of political discourse that sort of seems like it's it's ruling the day unfortunately and it's and it's only happening on these websites and the people who run these websites know it's only happening because it gets them clicks but unfortunately you know people who are sort of younger and they want to sort of learn how the world works and they want to figure the world oh and they and they want to know where they can kind of you know have political discussion with their peers and sort of you know get a glimpse of how to fix the world because people young people are they're very idealist you know and they want to make the world a better place but unfortunately the first places they're turning to are running into to sort of get a hint toward how to do that our places where they're putting up articles like this which are simply not very informative at all and are just kind of emotionally manipulative it's it's sort of interesting that that nowadays were so focused on things like let's say for instance cultural appropriation when you know we'll point somebody like Iggy Azalea for instance and say you know obviously that's an instance of cultural appropriation and I don't debate that but what I think is interesting is that you know even the stuff to you that is not passing for cultural appropriation now as far as like culture music art so on and so forth that only seems that way because it's coming out nowadays because the thing is everything we're listening now that's new it's based off of decades and decades and decades of some kind of cultural appropriation in some directions every single rock band you listen to you know it has has roots going far back enough to stuff like the blues Rolling Stones for being enamored of music that originated with African Americans in the South I mean it's just how far back do you go and how do you police this I mean like do you I've seen the example given across the internet of like oh we'll chill should we tell Chinese people not to play classical music because it originated in Europe I mean just it seems like a silly example but the lengths to which some of the counter examples go it just seems logical to pop up with stuff like this and be like okay what why are we arguing about this are we really that genuinely concerned that genuinely outraged why are we so pissed off about this it's music yeah and I mean you know we could police it so far back as to say you know we should probably step on the artistic hopes and dreams of anybody who is making electronic music because of a lot of the European history that that those that that genre has I mean you know take away the music making tools of anybody who came after craft work you know you know or something like that I mean you can get that ridiculous with it and and the thing is it just kind of seems like a bit of an eye-for-an-eye thing to me because you know once you sort of step on somebody's creativity and say oh well no actually that creativity comes from somewhere else you know the thing is somebody can come to that person and say well no actually your creativity comes from me and then someone can step to that person I mean you know while Iggy Azalea can most certainly you know uh you know have someone step to her and say hey you know you're really just kind of appropriating hip-hop right now I mean I'm sure that there are probably hundreds of jazz musicians who would have loved to have had that opportunity when it came to stepping to rappers and being like hey listen your your sampling my music right now and I don't like the way that fucking sounds and I don't like the things you're saying I don't like the things you're doing over it when you know honestly you know people might sort of just kind of paint hip-hop and and and and I think it's a good thing that culturally we've come to accept it as an art form you know but if we were to take it back a ways when people didn't understand it as such you know you can't say that those jazz musicians whose music had been sampled you know and they weren't just simply viewing hip-hop as black culture and around you know and a reflection of such you know they saw it as their culture their culture as jazz musicians being stolen and you can't say that their feelings weren't legitimate and I I mean I'm much more inclined to look into the world of the artists themselves and see how they feel about it than I am just like random people on Twitter and I think that's much more fascinating too because you get collaborations you get mutual respect and you get beefs between people and you get people calling each other out and it's to me that's fine because it's people who are within the craft who are feeling one way or another and it's not to say that fans shouldn't have opinions but to me it just that's a lot more interesting and it makes a lot more sense I I get what you're saying I mean unfortunately uh well I mean fortunately in a way it's it's been cool that social media has kind of democratized opinions in in in such a way you know it's it's allowed us to be in a position where situations like what had occurred with Mike Brown and Tamir rice and Eric garner you know had not been swept under the rug as most likely they would have prior to the Twitter age however also it seems as if music fans and I guess I'm sort of a part of this and in a way have more of a say as to what should go on in music than the actual musicians you know because there if anybody's gonna have an opinion on sort of cultural appropriation in hip-hop music you know I'd rather listen to an artist sort of say that if that's how they really feel if that's what they really believe you know as much as I do disagree with him on some points you know I'd rather listen to a Lord Jamar who has done many a vlad TV interview of Brand Nubian who's sort of well-known for his very controversial opinions mostly you know off of that YouTube channel you know I'd rather listen to him sort of say his piece not only because you know I know he's gonna state it in a in a way where he's a kind of got experienced because he's an artist but also because he has a deep history with the genre and it's funny that like the easiest I mean the common trope is to say well I mean if you don't like this don't listen to it I mean that could work too if enough people just don't like Iggy Azalea and just don't pay for music but we're also living in a time where paying for music is a much more nebulous concept so yeah yes same token like social media like allows that to happen but so like it's become a way of policing and in the midst of really a devalued dollar in terms of music yeah yeah and I mean paying for music it's just becomes so nebulous I mean I'm looking at I'm looking at the Billboard charts and I just don't know what the fuck I'm looking at anymore like when I look at your record and it's number one it's number two it's number ten it's number whatever I mean is there because people bought it is it there because people streamed it is there because they watched a few music videos on YouTube a bunch of fucking times I really don't know anymore what's the you know what what's the metric you know and that's the thing I mean a while ago billboard had announced that you know we're gonna be including you know you know streaming service streams you know and and and that sort of thing to sort of tell you how popular an album is is an album number one has it sold X amount of copies it just seems like it's all mixed into the point where it's just it just doesn't really mean much of anything anymore you know plus I mean a number one album just doesn't require the amount of copies that it used to you know what it really requires these days is for kind of an open playing field you know for nothing else relevant to be getting released exactly so I don't know but with this new Adele album coming down the pipe maybe we'll see another maybe we'll see another record where it's just like for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks it's like number one it's number one all freaking year oh that's that's true as well I mean that wouldn't platinum pretty quick yes um Drake's Drake's new tape would platinum pretty quick yeah I don't know how Kendrick is doing in terms of sales right now I should be doing pretty well but uh but yeah that's it I think we'll leave it at that I want to uh thank you Matt again for coming on to the show having this discussion with me about music writing but also just uh you know we we really digressed and talked about just kind of a little music industry shit in general that's quite all right it was a lot of fun I will leave a link down in the description box where you can check out Matt's website he should be putting up reviews newer views by the time you you hear this you hear this podcast dude what's what's sort of your uh your schedule when can people find new stuff uploaded to the site like once a week then it became once every two weeks it's been oscillating back and forth but there will definitely be a new one up by the time this podcast airs okay and it seems that you know you're always pretty engaged on Twitter as well if anybody wants to ask you a question or a know you or yell at you for whatever reason that's true I will have a snappy response in the holster all right we'll have his Twitter down in the description box as well in his Facebook and you just kind of check out his whole deal again Matthew wendice thanks for coming on you're very welcome 
LiMbXbv2nI4,and I know when that hotline ting mmm hey that you wanna sing sing sing oh yeah and I know when they're happening ting hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new car seat headrest record teens of style we need somethin over here we need something over here need something over here what do we gotta put here Thundercat Thundercat that's the guy Thundercat car seat headrest is a loaf I rock project and I guess a bit of a creative outlet for singer/songwriter will Toledo who has been releasing self releasing one album after another under this name for the good part of about five years now and now with this new record over here he is making his Matador Records debut so of course that means this record is going to be a point of exposure for a lot of people although if you have not heard wills music before I recommend that you hit up his band camp which I have linked down there in the description however I don't really think this new album over here is is really that bad of an introduction either because we'll really cleaned up his act a little bit and ro some pretty sharp songs for this record still this album is a little loaf I though not quite loaf i through and through it's kind of one of those records that sounds like it might have been recorded in a studio but some aspects some pieces of the instrumentation are a little rough around the edges to sort of give that rough and tumbled vibe specifically the vocals which are pretty fuzzed out and a little distorted and the guitars too which can be pretty messy at points now the vocals in the mix are a little buried but will happens to have a voice that that has a bit of depth to it and when he sings he's a little stone-faced somewhat deadpan rude emphasizing those lower notes and his register while his vocals are not as prominent or as clear as maybe I would like them to be he certainly does have a few vocal quirks that make him kind of enjoyable to listen to and another thing is I think he gives us a little bit to chew on lyrically with this project sort of like on the song strangers where all of a sudden in the middle of the track we have this introspective moment where we'll is talking about sort of falling in love with the music of REM and Michael Stipe thinking as a child that Michael's lyrics were talking directly to him I guess sort of because they were speaking to him emotionally in a really significant way you could tell that to will message in lyrics and music are important because he seems to sort of emphasize them on his own album over here however this is not one of those confessional diary style intimate singer-songwriter records Will's lyrical approaches much different than that in spirit this album is more like a lo-fi slacker indie rock record that pulls a lot of influence from bands like pavement and a little bit of The Strokes a bit of Beach Boys as well as the Everly Brothers especially on the very cutesy closing track which has some hilarious lyrics about saying goodbye to secret files there are actually few other spots on here where it feels like will is indulging in a bit of Internet age humor and the very short one-minute cut in the middle of the album actually took me back to a time that that it was just like totally radio-friendly 90s pop punk all the way but is slacker as this record might seem on the surface sometimes the instrumentation really comes through and surprises and and I think Wow's sort of like on the song Mod Grove where it's it's a very odd sunburnt little lo-fi pop rock tune where all of a sudden an instrumental bridge pops in where some saxophones start playing it's actually kind of beautiful and joyous and a really celebratory and their bits of instrumentation on other tracks that impressed me quite a bit like on strangers or time to die where one of the quirkiest things about this track is all these weird electronic edits of the vocals and the the lead instrumentation kind popping in and out over the foundational bass and drums the instrumentation on this record all in all is is pretty well put together though there are some spots where it feels a little sloppy but intentionally so and in a way it's kind of endearing now I will say that will is the most original singer-songwriter on the block and I think there are moments where a few of his songs do seem kind of drab and maybe a little run-of-the-mill not really sticking out to me in any kind of way but I think the the biggest Achilles heel on this record are the lo-fi aspects of the recording here I feel like will bring so much to the table in terms of lyrics in terms of melody and song structure that the loaf I think just kind of seems like this needless aesthetic that only Bland's out the instrumentation it takes the bite away from the vocals away from the guitars and and I think this record just would have done better with a fuller sound the strengths that we'll has on this record really have little to nothing to do with this album being lo-fi sometimes the instrumentation like I said could be a little messy could be a little endearing that's totally cool but the best spots on this album are lyrical and their musical and if a car seat headrest record is going to WoW me in the future although I'm sure that there are a lot of fans who are digging this record a lot because there are a lot of good things about this album but at least for me personally I think those strengths should be played to a little bit more and that's it I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this record to listen look at that look at that that's a nice over there we have nice things here what do you think I should review next and did you did you love and did you hate this record I hope you have a nice day forever 
IvKLOel4jhg,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for a review of the new panopticon's record autumn eternal panopticon's is a louisville kentucky black metal project fronted by one single main brain multi-instrumentalist magic man mr. Austin one I first caught on to his music at least under the panopticon name in 2012 with the album Kentucky which in some respects was a pretty standard homespun black metal record with your tremolo guitars and your ratchet vocals and your blast beat drumming very speedy very intense there were some great melodies written on to this album too but one of the cool things that sort of stuck out about this record was the extra instrumentation there was a lot of acoustic and Fulke instrumentation in this thing and not just any folk instrumentation full instrumentation that was borrowing from the american folk music tradition austin was even showing a little bit of bluegrass shining through on some of the cuts here as well as on his next full-length album roads to north an album that I liked a lot more because there were elements of the performances and the mixing on Kentucky that I thought were a little sloppy roads to the north were really where things got cleaned up check this record out if you haven't already the music on this thing was beautiful was triumphant but also very dark now his latest over here is autumn eternal apparently it is the third part of a trilogy that began with the kentucky album so this is kind of the finisher and it's got a slightly different vibe from the previous two panoptic on albums I think sonically this record is a little bit more traditional than the two previous records from this project I've very little of the acoustic dynamics that you might remember from the previous two records show up on this new album they are there but they show up a little more subtly or a little more rarely this record over here in contrast with the previous two is much more electric it's roaring Lee loud it is explosive it's visceral it's mean it's snarling the whole thing does kick off with a very warm sleepy acoustic intro but I think that's just a kind of get our mouths watering for the very intense and electric songs to follow the songs on this record are winding they're very ambitious song structures which are helped out by these soaring and femme acute are melodies that are often harmonized with other multitrack guitars to a very beautiful effect and those strings and woodwinds that popped up on previous records do show up here but like I said subtly like on my favorite track here sleep to the sound of the crashing waves which has this beautiful stunning little string interlude in the middle of the track the angelic bells and synthesizers at the end of the song into the Northwoods is really nice as well and these interlude moments are actually worked into the songs themselves on this record there are no little acoustic breathers in the tracklisting here like there were on roads to the north all the songs here are actually quite long and very expansive multifaceted now to go back to that song into the north woods one of the first tracks that kicks off this entire record while I do like that outro a lot the song itself is one of the more mild tracks in the tracklisting to me mostly because sonically I feel like it's kind of standard for a lot of modern homespun black metal even though I do like the production generally and props to Colin Marston on the production on the mixing on this record and even if the songs here might sound a little less unique because the instrumentation is a bit more standard still the compositions the melodies worked into these tracks are great in the performances it's just super top-notch the guitar crescendo it like the 430 mark of this song is really powerful and on songs such as Oaks ablaze or the title track here these are moments that while electric I feel like this album really starts to define itself some of the album's best guitar melodies end up on these tracks the drumming is intense and animalistic the bass lines have a little bit of crunch and distortion just add some bite into the mix these songs are just super blood pumping while simultaneously being really epic and progressive and just loaded with and inspiring guitar leads now sleep to the sound of the crashing waves again my favorite cut here is a really melodic pretty centerpiece for the album especially with that string interlude in the middle it's a nice little breather for the record and adds a very dynamic beautiful spot on this record just kind of take a little bit of a break from a lot of the intensity and compositionally it's worked into this very lengthy song pretty well but also some of the most intense and disharmonious drums and guitars are worked into this track too now the song pale ghosts I think is a bit more easygoing while it does have some epic Rock crescendos I think melodically and in chord wise as well there's not a whole lot here that feels as challenging is what the the album has delivered so far the whole vibe of the track seems a little post rock inspired which while that's ok I can't help but feel as if that's uh I don't know it's a little below what panoptic on has been doing up until this point and there's sort of a weird vocal switch up toward the end of this track where we get these moaning very emotionless clean vocals that really don't do that much for me I don't really think they add that much to the record pale ghosts really kind of standing out to me as a major weak point on the album but changing the vocals up to some cleans actually works really well on the next track a superior lament on this song we actually have a new singer entirely who's growls and cleans actually fit really nicely on this song the growls are really ferocious again I use the word animalistic and the cleans while maybe they're not super expressive they do have a bit of a cultish chant-like vibe to them that I think works really well into the context of this album especially lyrically aware we are told a lot about the theme and the concept of this record and the music itself is really explosive and grand I mean this 11 minute cut panopticon's really takes advantage of the time slot when it hands itself 11 freakin minutes it just really matches the the general ambition of this song and many others saw that are around this length previously released on other projects as far as American black metal goes I mean panoptic on with these two recent projects has just been killing it and with this last track that that ends this album off we get an incredibly climactic finish not only for this record but the trilogy that this album is finishing off in general the song goes back a little bit into that post track direction with these sliding slinky guitar melodies over this really moody backing instrumentation but it's really nice and the moments where the instrumentation does get intense I mean it rattles up into space it's super dynamic and and much more intricate than I think some of the crescendos that we were being handed on pale ghosts but regardless of any one moment to her song that I didn't care for it too much on this record I think generally this is a great album one of the better metal albums of this year and a really good finish to this trilogy so good I'm probably going to be going back and sort of revisiting Kentucky and seeing if that grows on me anymore now that I really loved the two albums that have followed it I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this thing trans hey everyone listen if you've given this record a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana pan optic on forever 
ltAcCZEZixI,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here you know who it is pretty exciting news from the people over a vine only please the fantastic record of the Month Club which I am a part of they are going to be releasing this month a reissue of Black Sabbath's 1970 sophomore album paranoid with a beautiful purple vinyl with some white marbling which is of course sourced from the original analog tapes just like with other vinyl me please releases there is a 12 by 12 art print that comes with this thing as well if you want this record to come to your door this month you are going to need to sign up for a vinyl e please subscription by November 15th in order to get a hold of this thing and of course you will be getting other future VMP releases as well link in the description of course the URL is on the screen as well and here's the review hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and I'm going to do a quick favorite albums from this past month video that this past month well to fruitful didn't love too many records but I'm going to recommend to you some of the records that I think stood out to me at least a little bit from the past 30 days or so let's go one the new proto martyr record the agent intelligence if you're looking for a dark moody post-punk album with some pretty cool lyrics and just to you know really devilish vibe at some points then give this record a listen gave it a review I will link all the reviews that I have done for these albums down in the description box like usual of course as well as a link to listen you're the best next we have the new Joey in a new some album divers if you're into joanna newsom you should have already listened to this album already but if you're unfamiliar with her and you're looking for a set of songs that are really expansive and sort of conceptual lyrically and we've got some really beautiful piano and harp on this record some arranged instrumentation as well and of course joanna newsom is really eclectic idiosyncratic voice give this thing a listen if you're in a Kate Bush if you're into these artsy singer songwriters that are kind of odd and difficult to make heads or tails of then I think this record will most likely be you know that musical puzzle that you will enjoy solving until the end of the year following that I also loved the new game album documentary 2.5 West Coast rapper game came through with a really great sequel to his sequel of the documentary it's almost like a sequel hip hop record time paradox but what I liked so much about this album is that game gets really personal on a lot of these tracks conceptual and topical on a lot of these tracks and the production track for track or track is really beautiful and I think he flows through a series of different vibes and production styles and emotions on this album that comes together really cohesively really nicely it's a really ambitious record and I think a really mature record for game total respect for him on this album thought it was great another record that I thought was really fun from this past month was the new me on Indian album international big international night school if you're looking for some analog flavored synth bunk that sounds like it came from the past but it's so nostalgic and oddball that there's no way it could have been from anywhere else but the future then you're gonna want to give this thing a lesson and finally I will give a shout out to the new the world as a beautiful place and I'm no longer afraid to die album harmlessness this album fuses some indie rock and pop punk and emo and post-rock together and do a series of songs that I didn't think I would like as much as I did I think some people have been a little disappointed with the band changing their style as much as they have on this project but I think a lot of the music here is pretty beautiful it's idyllic and when the lyrics actually do shine through is saying something that carries quite a bit of weight to it I think the record really hits emotionally and yeah those are the records that I think that you should be checking out from this past month I like you thank you for watching my videos all the time I appreciated it position and you've given this record a listen we just came in from the transition every review I do I am on a mission tell you what I think about the album just listen tell me what you think did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best love you oh yeah this is for a great albums video all these albums are good I think all these albums are great have you heard him and if you haven't then check them out what albums from this past month we're some of your favorites I hope you're well forever
