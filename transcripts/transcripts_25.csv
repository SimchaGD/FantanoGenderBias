X2wt88DjLtE,hey everyone Anthony Fantino here internets busiest music nerd and we're we're getting through this record collection we are about halfway through this thing as we dive into part 8 of my alphabetical trudge through my vinyl collection series let me kind of set my timer right here you know we do things raw here in this segment we do not edit it is just flat and in my last video I actually wanted to mention to you guys I showed you guys this hives LP one thing that I did not mention to you guys something I neglected is that this thing is on milky white vinyl although for some reason there's like a black streak there this early came out in the printing it's not anything that affects the play or anything like that but sweet milky white vinyl wooo chair squeaking man sure is squeaking alright we are back to Canadian electronic rock hybrid outfit holy whose last LP I was not really huge on and I remember I really loved this album when I first heard it when I listened to it now I do feel like yeah you know maybe the songs could be more developed than they actually are but I still think this album is really really fun to listen to I mean yeah lovely Alan got overplayed a little bit but I mean damn milk sheep milk sheep milkshake is on here such a great tract it's like the 80s on steroids that track but you check that album out if you've never heard of old before and the idea of an electronic rock hybrid kind of interests you more on the rock side though let's put this up here put that there Huey Lewis send the news man sports pick this up over to use record store for two bucks I mean you can't go wrong for two bucks with a very clean and in great condition copy of this record which you know I'm sure a lot of people are gonna be like really Anthony really like new wave new wave poopie yes really new wave poopie I mean you know freaking walking on a thin line the heart of rock and roll and where's that other song I want a new drug is on here and the Ghostbusters theme basically rips that song off you know I'm just saying new drug cool tune do you like Huey Lewis in the news I can't wait to see all those comments grab this for five bucks Human League dare you know not their biggest singles on on this LP but still you know here if you're heavy into a synthesizer pop you know it's not like I'm only humanism it's not like human is on your assembly you know do up that song but it's pretty sweet you know as first synthesizer pop it's it's it's decent they have definitely put out more interesting releases I think had had better singles the vocals on this LP are okay they're just okay their points when it's like a but still you know it's when it comes to vintage synthesizer popping you're looking for those sounds you know you're looking for for for that era you want something that kind of you know relives that brings that magic home I mean this is it and for five bucks you know it's not a bad steal iceage new Brigade reviewed this LP for you guys not incredibly you know stellar you know black record great condition thick although this LP does kind of come with this is interesting this is interests on teh to complement the album release they came out with a booklet are their lyrics and hearing can't remember yeah there are some those look like there are some lyrics in here but for the most part which you like pictures of the band stuff like that ice age tattoo right under the nipple of this man imagine member of the band is some kind of a cult imagery going on here throughout mayhem patch on the back of the shirt or jacket rather that's classy you got a punk show someone's on the floor maybe moshed a little too hard more lyrics fingers cut off more pictures these guys are just finished in the middle of nowhere but rocking the hell out I mean really classy classy dudes shoutouts to Ice Age for just being awesome Interpol come on the bright lights man classic I mean as class as it goes as classic as a moderate record is gonna get right now you know Matador really did a nice to reissue with this thing I do like this plastic sleeve that they've been putting things out with even though they can't get a bit dusty and the the record pressing is thick I mean it's gotta be 180 but yeah Interpol turn on the bright lights you know if you're looking for a a classy post-punk revival band definitely check that out I'm sure a lot of you already have it already hired meetin killers I wish I had more Iron Maiden on vinyl this is my hole in the Iron Maiden on LP my only hired mating record on vinyl you know I do love power slave and you know the Bruce Dickinson records after this this is pretty convenient is still great you know but uh some great songs in here I'm not going to sing because mmm let's let's just not even get into it but uh but still a solid LP you know solid Iron Maiden LP murders in the Rue Morgue is is definitely my favorite track I remember when a friend of mine and I kind of like simultaneously started like picking up Maiden stuff we were just like look that's fun too you know and they were just like singing the hook back and forth to each other all the time like we're placing with other lyrics just to be obnoxious Billy Idol white wedding single man 12-inch got this from my aunt from her record collection that was just like yo you want this and she's like habit and a great condition man Noah those scratches are nothing on it why it's gonna be a little bit of dust but you know it's still in great condition I don't even think I've actually played this since I grabbed this from her I mean I've heard the song you know it's like I like this song but I don't think I actually got a chance to put the the record on the on the platter on the b-side we got white wedding part 2 and white wedding parts 1 into on the a side there we go it's gonna be a white wedding the jam man this is the modern world one of these sort of like mod punk bands I mean definitely look these guys up they have some classy songs the modern world around the world let me see mmm London girl hmm it's a good solid LP you know their other songs of theirs that I like them a lot of songs on here but this is still a really solid LP and just like a show of but they were doing at that time I mean you know they definitely had kind of like a punk aesthetic but there were bands around like the jam that were you know not necessarily considered to be you know just thrown into the the punk arena you know not quite going for that same I guess punk ambience you know maybe a little bit more refined a little bit more classy more influenced by the WHO and stuff like that all right Nicholas char spaces only noise I got this up German import I have a German import is every great Nicolas JA record yea space is only noise this actually has kind of like an extra track on it that did not come with the the US release you know nice nice depressing the record I love how textured you know so it's it's not like a it's not that it's not a glossy it's sort of like a you know it's like it's the cardboard finish you know the of the thing it's it's very nice rough texture to it and over here I've also grabbed a but don't break my love 10-inch that that Nicholas put out I mean really solid 10-inch not really any kind of like obvious markings on this when I first put it on I didn't know where to put it on 45 or 33 it really kind of confused me but still good no need a really great couple of tracks one of my favorite EPS of that year it's not my favorite EP escapes me at the moment Jethro Tull a quill along grabbed it for two bucks a to use record store I think in Northampton um great album I think the first track skips a little itty-bitty bit the covers kind of beat to crap yeah it is I had to tape the bottom of it the rectum flip out but still a fantastic album I mean Jethro Tull if you're looking to get Jethro Tull flute filled prog rock Faulk tinged Ian Handerson is the man you know do check out this album look it up man equilon class and got thick as a brick as well not the super special you know original print of it where you get the newspaper and everything like that you know really just kind of like the the pleat cover but still a great album thick as a brick where we going man we got a journey man escape which I'm pretty sure I also got from my aunt who you know had a lot of 80s records and you know I'm pretty sure I only own this for don't stop believin just saying just putting it out there just yeah you're squeaking okay man Joy Division right there all right we're gonna continue this at a another time love you you hatha new Fantana record collection forever [Music] 
orJVZPz8XXU,hi everyone Anthony Pham tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review dark time sunshine a and X dark time sunshine is the hip hop duo of Cape Cowen hope I'm pronouncing that correctly he is the MC in the duo and Zavala the producer this is the follow-up to the 2010 album vessel and here they kind of continued their tradition if you can use the word tradition with a band that has such a small discography a tradition of creative beats and kind of a subdued rapping style paired with some pretty heady and and dense lyricism a lot early Aesop Rock before I go into this review I'm gonna say this is not a hip-hop album for everybody I mean surely anyone can listen to it but this is not one of those hip-hop LPS that that goes hard or really kind of shows any kind of major dark side or aggression or anything like that I actually think it's significantly less dark than their previous LP overall ANX even in its loudest and most hyped up moments is is a very introspective and and contemplative hip-hop album which may be exactly the kind of hip-hop albums one of you needs right now any fan of dark time sunshine is going to notice right off the bat that the production has has really changed not only in sound but in mood as well and people who are new to dark time sunshine - I think you're gonna find the production on this thing - at least kind of stick out to you maybe not be the most unique thing on the block but but definitely bring a kind of heavenly tone this help you for sure is not really the kind of sample heavy cluttered moody and and sometimes noisy soundscape that vessel was by contrast on a NX the production here is is much more dreamy smooth Spacey I would throw in the word sweet too and and maybe even call me there are loads of tuneful choruses on this thing for example the track can't wait which is one of the songs that kind of kicks this LP off has a really really strong synth melody just soaring over the chorus as do a lot of songs on here and the track valiant which is really one of my favourite tracks on here has just a myriad just a casserole of synth sounds and phrases layered on top of each other playing on this really really tight and and busy drum break there's a really dreamy vocal contribution from child actor on that track and she shows up later on the LP too and what I like about this song is that this thing has maybe the most synthesizer layers on it than any other track on the album but they are organized so methodically that it all kind of just makes sense and functions in harmony there are a couple other guest singers on this thing like on the tracks I'll be damned and never cry wolf and and honestly I find a lot of the singers on this LP to be really kind of weak when it comes to power behind their voice emotion behind their voice I mean the same song he chorus is on this LP really did nothing for me absolutely whatsoever I actually thought these particular tracks were kind of the low points on the album even if the production was good even if the lyrics and the verses were pretty good or profound but still these guest singers and all the synthesizers and and the lack of just moody sounds that make Vessel such a potent album this ANX is is so much more of a blissful move for dark times sunshine I mean it's really just kind of like a hip-hop dream which is fine because Kate Cowan actually acknowledges dreams as being a pretty big influence or maybe not an influence but a great way to find lyrical content because so much of his lyricism has like borderline surreal qualities to it now the rapping on this thing from him overall it's kind of monotone actually a little bit more monotone than he was on vessel I mean he's really shooting for something much more laid-back way more contemplatively you too you know Nash your teeth or moving your see or anything like that I mean really just kind of massage your mind even when he does manage to spit out something pretty fast which can be often because he does have a fast flow I mean there's a lot of technical ability to his rapping it's still pretty you know hmm I mean the only tracks on here that kind of stick out to me is not having a blissful feel to them are like rock off look at what the cat do which features bus driver and a song on here that really kind of reminds me of a song or two from vessel that had kind of a competitive feel to it because you had numerous emcees on it take my hand which features suam burger and Aesop Rock you know and I do have to admit I do enjoy the darker and more gritty side of dark time sunshine the constant sonic ecstasy of a and X does kind of bore me a little bit does get a little mundane but I still acknowledge that that dark time sunshine does it really well I mean they've made a great transition they have really kind of made a 180 with the mood of their music in a lot of ways and and have done it to the point where it doesn't feel like a huge letdown I'm sure for a lot of fans it's it's kind of an improvement an exciting progression to kind of touch upon the lyrics and the subject matters of these tracks one of the songs that opens this LP up can't wait kind of talks about the progress of dark times sunshine and just like I don't know the the travel of their music of their kind of musical journey there's a line in here about wrapping it or just basically making music until the coffins dropping to me this track kind of actually feels like a letter to the listeners kind of maybe assuring them of what this album is gonna be where dark times sunshine is going to go how devoted they are to this vision to this direction the track cult class kind of takes a religious point of view or maybe not religious point of view but maybe kind of just like a fantasy religious point of view talking about getting on a rocket ship paid for by money from the church's collection plate and then going to heaven on it and they're talking about Apple employees being apostles I mean there's a lot of surreal imagery on on this thing but not necessarily I guess some kind of strong theme or message or point to what is being said at least to me anyway Rochester AP comes in on one of the verses later in the track and he just really is awesome on his verse I mean all the guest rappers on this album are great to be honest and there is space imagery in in his lyrics mentions of Dreams at this point you're kind of seeing the recurring themes in the track rock off dreams come up again where there's there's like more meta conversation going on in the lyrics with Kate Cowen mentioning that you know he uses dreams as an inspiration and then mentions how you know he took all these ideas from them and then wrote a track from their previous album and the track I'll be damned kind of feels like a self-improvement track just really kind of has this this feel of striving wanting to get better there's a great line on here about the art of storytelling that you've got to hear if you give a listen to this album the track take my hand that I mentioned earlier is just 100% lyrical fire with swamp burger and Aesop Rock on there and I actually think ASAP rocks verse on that thing the third verse on this track is like the most brutal verse on the entire LP with the mention of death cards and the trick and just kind of like how death is on hold on the phone and that's great but kind of a downside is that not only his verse but a lot of the verses from the guest rappers on this LP grab my attention and impress me whether it be with with Flo or just concept so much more than what dark time sunshine has going on you know I did like this album a lot but there were just kind of like some some glaring not huge glaring but glaring nonetheless negatives for me just constant bliss a lot of hooks that I didn't really care for and I do think the bright flashy scents and and just heavenly production do kind of overshadow the wrapping at times especially considering how much more subdued the flows are on this LP in comparison with vessel which I foolishly did not review in 2010 they just kind of got a new direction here that I'm not agreeing with 100% but still a really solid left-field hip hop album that you should check if you claim to be a fan of this genre you know you know if you know kind of feeling a decent strong seven on this LP what did you guys think if you've given it a listen did you love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana dark time sunshine forever 
Pa8lYyHRGZ4,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's a time to just sort of give some name drops give some mentions to what have been my favorite albums of this past month the month of sep tember my most recent super positive review was given to the new gaslamp killer LP breakthrough really in album to me that is a celebration of just the psychedelic and experimental beat music scene going on California right now in LA specifically not only does the gaslamp killer up his production chops for this LP but he brings on numerous artists who come from this style to kind of help him make this album the extremely colorful textured moody and diverse record that it is next i bet on sky the new dinosaur jr LP here dinosaur jr. basically does what they do as well as they have ever done it lots of very catchy kind of wimpy and whiny but a motive and and moving indie rock tunes with a lot of volumes very strong a lot of guitar solos that are just breathtaking awesome and some solid songwriting to next what I think is probably my favorite album of this entire month the new on the throw pika LP this is a self-titled album from a Colombian cumbia supergroup with a rotating cast of over 40 musicians playing on this thing some of them old Latin music veterans some of them new bright young minds who are experimenting with the genre bringing in elements of hip-hop and rock music electronic music as well and just all these flavors from Scott music to Middle Eastern music kind of come in and influence these vintage Latin sounds however the fact that they all play very well and they have a very strong Latin music foundation really pulls everything together and makes this album consistent despite the fact that it is genre wise and influence wise kind of jumping around all over the place it's just a fantastic album with a lot of great playing great improvisation and just enough change and and just enough again variety among these 20 or so tracks that are on this album to make the hour plus length that it lasts entertaining and engaging another LP i love this month the new corrales album years past matter this is a progressive rock album that uses the tremolo guitar playing the vocals and just the overall aesthetic of black metal to kind of bring these very tightly wound complex and and dizzying guitar compositions that go ten-plus minutes on a lot of tracks here I mean it is it is not a light listen it's very challenging it's very dense and it's really something that it took a while for me to kind of get through but once I got through it was just like dark tortured ecstasy yeah and as long as we're on the subject of dark and tortured the new murder construct album that came out this this year is freaking awesome if you're looking for a solid technically proficient and very methodical grindcore record that has some fantastic vocals from Travis Ryan of the band cattle decapitation he really just brings some hellish vocals on this thing the drums are very detailed they're all over the place and there are some nice moments where the base kind of steps out and does something melodic to on this album I mean it is an intense record it is just a brutal record not something that I think is necessarily going to step out and kind of pull in people who are not necessarily fans of grindcore already but still very solid and enjoyable album for this style alright those are those are the album's I am recommending for this past month of September let me know what you're you know enjoy recently you know what records did you love this month and and that's it you know that is it Anthony Fantana music recommendations forever you 
YYjbcGzONkc,hey the highly anticipated and requested review for the new cruel summer compilation from Kanye West's GOOD Music & Company is out and it is a collaborative review with my dudes over at a dead end hip hop you can click somewhere here to watch that or find a link below this video for good times and and yeah Cal's going to close us out with some good music 
DMzJ6KkJz_g,ah hey y'all Anthony Fantino here Internet's scratchy throat music nerd and it's time for a review Lupe Fiasco food and liquor to the great American rap album part 1 Lupe Fiasco is a Chicago rapper who made a pretty nice entry into the hip hop industry with a debut album that was lauda Daz just one of the best hip hop albums of 2006 this album was filled with catchy emotive production from the likes of Kanye West's soundtrack The Neptunes even Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda produced a track for this thing and of course movie brought maybe what he is best known for his very sharp thought-provoking lyricism with a very socially conscious edge it was just awesome to see somebody so high up in the hip hop industry with hit singles like kick push and daydreaming but also had kind of a refreshing perspective you know wasn't rapping about the same stuff that everybody else was now the very next year Lupe put out another LP the cool this album featured way more production from soundtrack Lupe lyrically was getting a bit more bold a bit more maybe preachy in a sense and he took a more conceptual route with the overall theme of the album and I feel like his more topical tracks on this LP were way more pointed like the song hip hop saved my life this LP is not as celebrated as food and liquor and of course there are reasons I mean it's not as immaculately produced you know definitely some questionable decisions I guess on this album but nobody saw what was coming down the pipe with what Lupe did last year with what was his latest album lasers the LP had a lot of pre-release drama the album's coming out a way it's not coming out then he claimed that his label made him make decisions that he wouldn't have made otherwise in regards to the hooks or the instrumentals no matter what the drama where the real story was what the end result was on on lasers was basically a socially conscious hip-hop album yes but with some very glitzy electronic and kind of sterile instrumentals that made Eminem's recovery look like it went as hard as Death Grips lyrically Lupe was still on point sure you know you couldn't really knock a lot of his messages on these tracks and and there were some decent singles on here like the pretty inspirational the show goes on but these pop beats are just too sweet on the ears not really representative of the urgency of some of the situations that Lupe was rapping about especially when you're getting these very bright loud auto-tune courses on the track beautiful lasers I mean that just really kind of made songs on here despite what Lupe was saying cut of unlistenable I kind of feel the same way about the track state-run radio I mean you know I could really agree with what a lot of Lupe is saying on here but you know I'm not into music for just the philosophy of it you know I mean I could totally agree with you and and that's cool you could be making a point that I am 100% behind but if it doesn't sound good I mean you know that I'm not liking it you know nothing against your ideology but I'm not liking your music and I feel like ever since the release of lasers Lupe has kind of been in the midst of damage control he put out the friend of the people mixtape shortly after the release of lasers and that mixtape ironically featured him rapping over more electronic beats which I previously thought were being forced upon him on lasers but now about a year later we have a new full-length album whose title evokes Lupe Fiasco's most celebrated album food and liquor specifically food and liquor two the great American rap album part one the part one is really there and I'm sure eventually we're going to get to Lupe Fiasco food and liquor too the great American rap album part two electric Boogaloo you know usually I could just totally give a she she she she she in terms of what the album title is with an LP but there's just so much pretense that comes with this title not only does the title imply that this LP is going to continue upon what made food and liquor great but the great American rap album part one well I feel like I can confidently say that this is not really a continuation of food and liquor and if it is it's it's really one of those movie sequels where 90% maybe 95% of everyone involved is like completely gone the lead role Lupe is still there but we've got different directors the love interest we remember from the last movie is like a completely different woman she was like a blonde in the first movie and now she's like a redhead and they're just kind of crossing the fingers and hoping that no notices and the fact that we do have a beat from soundtrack on on the second song here is really the only thing production wise that makes this album resemble food and liquor the biggest issue with this album and it continues to be an issue with Lupe is the production a lot of the instrumentals on this thing sound like they would have been popping behind gangsta rap club hits in the mid or early 2000s the beats on this thing with the exception of a few are just really forgettable bland and in kind of generic thin and just not a lot of punch not a lot of energy to them though they are not as bright or flashy or electronic as lasers I do think they're as poppy despite the fact that what a lot of Lupe is saying is real I feel like musically and instrumentally he sugarcoats it all the way I do like the soundtrack instrumental on strange fruition even though a lot of people kind of had some drama over the Pete Rock inspired sample on the track around my way and I don't really think that sample was executed in the most tasteful way possible I mean the beat is a little bland I do like the fact they are kind of tributing you know that era of hip-hop with that song and the instrumental behind the track cold war is pretty great too i like the the breathy vocal sample on there and jane totally just murders that hook was very powerful and passionate vocals but outside of that tracks like bitch bad I mean the instrumental on the thing just sounds so kind of cheap thrown together not really all that detail same thing with a track like Lamborghini angels I don't like that instrumental at all either and if there's one thing that disappoints as much as the instrumentals on this thing is the hooks like on the track it tau which kind of comes out right at the gate with this LP where Lupe Fiasco really says and some kisses for the babies like is he for serious I know the song has positive vibes it's well intended it's wishing the world were a better place it's optimistic its idealistic but could Lupe have maybe tried either instrumentally or or lyrically to make that idea sound maybe a little less corny than it actually is and when he's singing that hook later on the track with the auto-tune it just sounds terrible the track heart donor has a terrible hook as well and the song is unforgettable youth and battle scarves actually kind of sound like hooks that would make it onto an Eminem LP one of his new ones you know it's it's definitely not as shockingly bad as lasers but maybe that's only because the shock is kind of worn off at this point I mean if there's anything I can applaud on this album it's the lyrics I did like a lot of Lupe's lyrics on lasers but what kind of makes this help pay better than lasers is that you can actually hear them a lot of the time whereas the production on that last LP was was overshadowing hibbett points I do really like Lupe's verses on the track Lamborghini angels where he is throwing some really sharp and pointed criticisms at religion and I like the way how Lupe has three verses that tell kind of three sides to the story in the track pitch bed and then you just kind of ties them together at the end there are times when I do kind of feel like Lupe takes his point and he kind of just beats the listener over the head with it as opposed to being abstract maybe kind of letting people come to their own conclusions I'm not really sure how much further I can I can kind of go on with this album I mean I'm just going to keep running around in circles at this point if I talk anymore yeah I can keep praising and keep talking about lines that Lupe spits out in song concepts that he pulls together on this album the track hood now is great so is cold war so it was around my way lyrically but I'm just not liking the instrumentals on a majority of this album they really just kind of take the energy and the power out of a lot of what Lupe is saying I mean there is more urgency and and passion in the slam poetry on the track Ayesha says that kicks this album off then a lot of these songs with Lupe rapping over these weak instrumentals so again I don't really disagree with a lot of Lupe's points and I like that he's you know spreading this message and giving it to his listeners and a lot of them take it seriously but I mean me instrumentally and maybe even philosophically too I'm just going to kind of hang with the league of great socially conscious rappers to come before Lupe most def telling quali black star Boogie Down Productions A Tribe Called Quest Public Enemy the roots common and despite the fact that a lot of those artists are older you know let's be honest a lot of the problems that they rapped about are still kind of problems so to be completely honest I'm really feeling a strong four to a light five on this album definitely improvement over lasers but Lube eight really needs to get back to picking some good production did you love this LP did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Lupe Fiasco food and liquor - forever [Music] [Music] 
SjFIvCue6oE,hi everyone Anthony fan Tiano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the Gaslamp Killer breakthrough this guy is a California beat music producer as well as DJ whose music thrives within the worlds of glitch hop instrumental hip hop as well as turntablism I've been following the guy's work for a little while first caught on to him in 2009 I believe when he released a compilation of tracks called all killer on B music which is kind of this record label that just like releases B hi I guess I don't want to say quality that I for lack of a better word quality music just rarities a visit while I do wish he was a little bit more experimental or just a little bit more adventurous with the way he sampled things maybe manipulating the samples a little bit more from Heroes just totally clear that the Gaslamp Killer is really thriving off the legacy of albums like introducing for example later down the road he had two pretty solid EPS on brain feeder records the second which I definitely definitely recommend but when I really fell for this guy's work and got interested in him was when he made that collaborative LP with going to Sufi a Sufi and a killer in 2010 just a lot of unique textures sounds and in source material just nice beats again there were moments that when I kind of dug through what I found to be the source material for some of these tracks yeah you know maybe things could have been manipulated more maybe things could have been sampled more creatively but you know this is kind of what the Gaslamp Killer is he is just a master crit digger now everything the Gaslamp Killer has been releasing musically has been building up to this the profile of his label brain feeder records has has been growing over the past couple years to I mean him and veter are really icons when it comes to a certain musical scene right now and I don't think the selfie disappoints in my opinion it's actually one of the more ambitious LPS I've heard come off a brain feeder so far throughout the 17 tracks on on this LP the Gaslamp Killer actually pulls together some pretty distinct tracks of different shapes sizes sounds and textures styles and complexities too and he does it with an array of guest musicians producers and and ganja Sufi hops on a couple tracks to the Gaslamp Killer brings on beat Brethren's like dim light and computer Jay and shigeto and Daedalus he also brings on live instrumentation from people like RSI on this LP and there are some brain feeder cohorts on here as well like Miguel Atwood Ferguson and Sam I am as well and there's more where that came from I mean there's just a really hefty guest list on this album which helps bring some amazing variety to these songs the introduction on this LP is kind of a musical collage just like nothing but crate Doug magic kind of overlapping fed through this psychedelic fog it really kind of sets a dark weird mad-scientist assemble tone for the album go Andrew Sufi kind of does his thing on the next track over a string sample not an incredibly developed track but it does kind of get the flavor out there you know there are quite a few moments on here that do not feel developed by traditional standards however dudes like J Dilla Madlib and of course Flying Lotus have proven the power and in kind of delivering albums with this more ad D oriented style jumping from one idea to the next and I'm not necessarily against a one or two minute motif or or B or anything like that as long as the artist can make something impactful or moving or memorable meaningful within the short amount of time that they've given themselves I really dig the track holy Mount Washington which has these really just loud pounding sharp crisp drums backed up with these just very eerie string shots and then kind of a strange whistle really kind of hanging in the ambiance in the background I like the juxtaposition of the instruments on this track it's really like just some bitter and moody ear candy the gasps I'm Keller brings on some guests for the track dead vets which is like some psychedelic hip-hop infused funk but things get really layered and complex and detailed on the track flange face with with Michael Atwood Ferguson where you have the Gaslamp Killer delivering these just heavy drums synthetic distorted muck with some synthesizers and Ferguson just lays on these wonderful strings that have kind of a middle-eastern quality to them but at times they they kind of start dripping down the wall like droplets of blood in a horror movie that's one of the longer tracks on the album and it's kind of epic peaks like that that really in my eyes justify the smaller and shorter moments it's like you kind of have these well develop giants and then these you know shorter little morsels and bits hanging around them maybe buzzing around them like flies it gives the album an interesting flow a disjointed but but interesting flow there's always just kind of like a surprise turn about to happen and I like that the track he does with Daedalus is another darken and moody number and I love the really bouncy keyboard arpeggios that that come off that they sound like they almost have kind of like an 8-bit quality to them or something like that me then there's just something videogame about them and if another dependent I love the two tracks that close this thing out seven years of bad luck for fun is a great track really glitchy really tortured and the closer in the dark goes six minutes and stays engaging throughout I mean it's really climactic finish for this LP and kind of wraps things up brings things together it's kind of like it tells you everything and then it reminds you of what it just told you on this last track with some very spacious progressive synthesizers and and the strings come back as well the drums are heavy and just the mood is is so thick you can cut it with a knife just really tense you know are there negatives on the cell P for sure their tracks that I feel are kind of forgettable or maybe didn't have that impact in the short amount of time that Gaslamp Killer gives himself to make these tracks like the the sam-i-am track for example which I didn't really get a strong emotional pull from but that's part of the reason I do like love a lot of the tracks on this album because they just have such a strong emotional vibe to them this album definitely has a really heavy and dark quality to it lots of texture lots of great production I feel like a lot of people may get kind of annoyed with how disjointed this album can be and certainly a lot of the talent and a lot of the interesting ideas that come up on this album are outsourced through a very long series of guest musicians but you know what does couchy chesta think about this LP mr. gesslin pure violence is met the answer in the Anthony's a probably feeling is string saving or a lady and your album and that my friends is the review I hate counter chesta what did you think of this LP if you've given it a listen did you love it hate it why and what should I review next besides cruel summer let me know Anthony Fantana the Gaslamp Killer forever 
o6JTc1c1yVw,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and you know despite the reviews despite lectures all other kinds of crazy things that happen we cannot forget to stay on task with this my ever going trip alphabetically through my music collection I believe when we left ah we had a bit of Fugazi on our hands although since then I've recently incorporated the new Fox again EP into my collection whoo but nothing really awesome about the packaging you know just solid really awesome record you know what I mean just the music's good you know go figure alright so next in my collection I don't know if I own any more LPS maybe Bob Dylan rivals these guys or maybe did it one time I know I got a got rid of a few records that I had from him at one point but as at this point I'm not sure if I own more Fugazi LPS than than other artists well I I guess I guess Fugazi may be number one in my collection in terms of LPS I own Fugazi red medicine red medicine also got a copy oh what's this one steady diet of nothing this one solved this one has a track off of it called a uh what the hell is it called well I can look at the back reclamation that I think is awesome and long division is great as well this bag features a Makai of a mire threat as well as a guy Picciotto before the band was featured in rites of spring and you know it's they're just a really great stellar and just one of the first is just one of the best post-hardcore outfits just incorporating elements of hardcore punk whether it be the the fierce vocals or just the the guitar tone the guitar playing the the kinds of chords you know those power chords and the speed at times but maybe kind of developing the melodies a little bit more developing the song structures a bit more getting past that simplicity while incorporating more development more maybe technicality maybe more detailed to the songs and maybe different kinds of emotions to you know really kind of fleshing things out diversifying things while still kind of maintain that that punk energy that punk ferocity and you know Fugazi I mean just cover a lot of bases over the years in terms of just you know different instrumentation on their songs I mean you know there are some songs that are there some moments that feature piano on this LP red medicine that I highly recommend you know if you're getting into Fugazi also if you're getting into Fugazi try out this this uh this little red Deeley which I believe is uh is a self-titled maybe not you know I'm not seeing a title on the front I've never actually thought about what the title of this is all I know is that I've loved it what is on here that I think this great waiting room is a great track and as its given me the Cure so you know check this out as well good handful of songs on that this is great too in on the kill taker and on the kill takers solid and you know maybe if you're starting a Fugazi I mean start here start with their first LP I mean this is this is definitely one of my favorites from them but paid up you know just like so many great tracks on this thing really badass LP am I in focus let me make sure [Music] Fugazi repite all right fun times alright let's continue here gentlemen Jesse and his men introducing gentlemen Jesse and his men these guys are a you know I just showed all that stuff nothing really amazing about the packaging in those records you know not Gate folds or anything or like that but just a really good lp's um gentlemen Jesse and his men here sorry didn't dive into that I usually do an album on I thought this album was on a ridiculous label or something like that that was gonna make him laugh but I forget really nice pressing of this LP salad but um these guys are a power pop outfit you know like a little bit of Elvis Costello influence going on here yeah with the cover but with the music as well really catchy tunes not exactly a you know a new kid on the block in terms of style but like really great tracks on here butterfingers one of my favorite pop rock tunes mmm this thing came out 2008 I believe let me see rest of my days is great all I need to know is you that's not really how the song goes but now green let's stay together some speaks excess owl this is actually uh this is actually my mother's copy that she had when she was a kid and gave it to me great condition Al Green man that's data smooth Al Green is a cool bro some jazz jazz that a friend of my Derek gave to me a Apollo Hall concert 1954 live recording of Lyle Hampton hmm actually I even listen to it a really long time I don't even remember what it sounds like I mean he gave it to me listen to it but that was years ago there are some things in here I haven't listened to in a while this I have listened to you recently though Herbie Hancock headhunters if you're looking to get into funk and jazz fusion I mean really just seminal record and an incredibly influential really great album I mean just so many funky freakin riffs and the electric piano on this thing the cents on this thing is great and man just like if you don't get a copy this record at least look up the song chameleon look up the song chameleon you were gonna love that bass line alright let's see this is a nice one this is good this is a good one any great anything crazy about the packaging here you got some lyrics a little collage but this is Richard he'll and the voids which for some reason I remember when I first read that I was thinking the voivode's what no Richard hell and the boy toys Richard hell is like one of the original CBGB's dudes there was this really terrible movie that was released in conjunction with this album to kind of promote the release of the album like any Warhol's and it's like really bad but the album's let me see love comes in spurts man look up that song look up new pleasure to Richard hell new pleasure blank generation is great and there's a Creedence Clearwater Revival cover on this thing of all things great record you know great punk slash / no punk record Jimi Hendrix compilation Smash Hits I mean Purple Haze fire hey Joe I mean everything's on here you know well not everything all along the watchtower well you know the hits unfortunately I don't have any other Hendrix on vinyl other Hendrix I have is either CD or digital so now that's all my Hendrix vinyl unfortunately high on fire new high on fire LP did Burmese mysteries really sweet gatefold but they put together with this LP you get the picture of the band they're looking badass get a picture of the lyrics really nice back cover they got going on there I like the kind of old-school labeling that they've got going on here I like that a love bhai on fire logo looks classy you know it looks classy and it's a it's a heavy pressing too which is good alright continuing whoo I believe I have another yeah you know another one from these guys hives first two albums back when these guys were just you know more of a solid punk rock outfit or the solid punk rock outfit we're in the ages dudes from the ages The Hives I mean not one of my favorite punk bands in the world the album they followed this one up with was an extreme disappointment for me really started incorporating all these elements of the Rolling Stones which you know isn't a bad thing but you know just really I don't know it just wasn't for me it wasn't it wasn't that great in my opinion but but this LP though it does not have the flavor of this album it is really catchy it is fast you know it is a good modern Punk record okay okay you know so here we go again some of their badass track I mean you know a lot of the formulas that they used to write their songs on this LP are applied on this LP but you know here's where they really you know had their best hits and stuff like that you know what else they get together to tear it apart die alright of course what else is on here where is that song where's that hot hot need to say I told you so you know there are moments on this album that sound light you know hate to say I told you so but that really kind of turned out to be the hit you know it's a decent nice little reflection on the lettering you know it's put a good cover together it's really nice packaging on this LP this is a closing track on here first closing track it was a nice little find another girl find it other girls a nice tune it's one of the nicer moments on here got the lyrics on the back too classy packaging on this I think this is just a sleeve I'm not mistaken not we got a cut lyrics here as well pictures of the band looking sweet file under punk rock or whatever or whatever holy these guys are like a Canadian rock electronic music hybrid um you know okay you know I'm gonna have to cut it off here we'll continue with this next time we do a vinyl video how's that sound Anthony Fantana vinyl flavor [Music] 
aUClt-ivlH0,hi everyone aunt Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review title fight floral grain these guys are a Pennsylvania man this is their sophomore studio LP and since their earliest releases they've been incorporating elements of punk rock pop punk post hardcore into their music with a bit of an emo twist they're a band that really just kind of celebrates all of these underground flavors of rock music that were big in the 90s for the mecca's of creativity that they were if you give this LP listen you're definitely going to be picking up hints of jawbreaker of um of knapsack of hot water music maybe you could even like in some of the rips to Nirvana some of the really strong melodic guitar playing to Dinosaur Jr and and some of the shots of noisy feedback filled distortion to Sonic Youth the thing is to me this album is just pretty much like a Frankenstein monster of all of the records that kind of drove title fight to make this record and you know the thing is whose music isn't that to an extent sure I can see that what kind of bugs me with with title fight though is that I can really kind of see the seams of what they've sewn together the ideas and the influences on this album aren't really melted together with a bit of title fights own signature personality kind of thrown into to make it their own thing and the only reason I really feel that way is because when it came time to really kind of write this review after listening to this album again and again I was writing and thinking well their music is influenced by a B C and D but and then I just continuously drew blank after blank after blank I just couldn't really say anything after that do these guys do anything new or novel with their influences you know do they use modern hindsight to kind of think about these records that came out years ago that influenced them in retrospect to kind of you know develop upon them maybe do something better do something a bit more fresh and I can't really say that happens here for the most part title fight is reliving an era of rock music that was very emotional very passionate part melodic part aggressive that that thrived into the early to mid-2000s if anything has kind of kept me enjoying this record despite that the band definitely has a very punchy modern loud recording I mean really good production on this thing and maybe the band's two respective songwriters are a bit more aggressive with their vocals a little bit more unrelenting you know just like consistent with that despite the extreme lack of originality if you are into music like this that you will be noticing what I did end up liking about this band a lot is just their energy their passion fact they're playing these tracks really well and they're writing some really good songs too and they brought quite a bit of variety to this LP with some pretty hyped tracks with some slower tracks too one of the lead singles to this LP secret society is just a really rowdy single I love it it just makes me want to jump into a circle pit of joy very catchy vocals on the hook and some subtle vocal harmony that goes on under that oh they you know made me but the chords are just the bomb on this track just in a that's like the way the guitars are being played is just so blood pumping right after that track the song head in the ceiling fan is is much slower much more emotive and and really one of my favorite tracks on the LP it's the first spot on the album where things just really slowed down and when I say slow down I mean like they are going like half speed like quarter speed in comparison with the other tracks and it sounds great at this point on the album I would actually say title fight sounds kind of blissful and here it becomes very obvious that not only is the band able to just write some really fast aggressive captivating moments with with that kind of flavor but they can be captivating going slow and then very kind of heavy sonically and and and emotionally - I like that versatility and then there's the track make you cry that comes in after that where I feel like both of those worlds kind of come together with a nice nice rich melody that comes in on the hook however for me the LP kind of hits a stride after that's not a good stride the tracks sympathy to Calais for me really just kind of breeze by and into me because of the lack of a fresh idea of a distinct idea or a distinct take on these sounds these tracks really just kind of sound very nondescript to me there are moments toward the beginning of this album that feels same though I like that some faster and more aggressive tracks are coming in here and that the band follows those up with with two great closing tracks which are slower are a little more toned down and to me are more interesting nothing really hit me on the album is being terrible but like I said it all kind of comes back to what I mentioned earlier that nothing on here really hits me as being oh this is title fight this is what they do this is their thing this is what they have conceived you know that didn't stop me from liking this album a lot but I do think because some of the tracks did come off forgettable because of that it did keep me from loving it you know I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this LP what do you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it hate it why and what should I review next let me know Anthony Fantana title fight floral green forever [Music] [Music] 
d71IRVl7PX4,"like turn it into their own personal you know kind of everyday thing kind of like you know turn it into their colloquial you know kind of a phrases in everyday language I mean you know that's that's the kind of thing that that really is extremely flattering to me and you know and is a signifier that I must be doing something when it comes to just connecting with people which is you know my ultimate goal when it comes to doing this you know to be able to turn people on to music that I think is interesting be able to show music that I think is good and you know as long as I sort of stay open to what comes down the pipe you know and I've had my times where I'm like I've heard a new thing and I've just been like yeah you know little be for example remember when I heard little be at first like most people you know in this room I'm sure you just did not get it you were like who's this dude he's like bitches on my dick cuz I look like Jesus and it's like what does that even mean it'll be in the house got that shirt but then it's let you know then afterwards after watching like 100 of his videos because they're so terrible you're like man I got to keep watching this train wreck and then you realize like wait he's joking he's making fun of everybody doing that and then you actually run across one of his songs where he's like rapping about something meaningful and you're like oh he still sounds kind of dopey but he's making sense now you know it's I guess the lesson in that is that you know I'm going to try to do my best into the future to be open to different in new things when they come across even if I am turned off to them at first and you know just continue hearing them if even if I am disappointed with the first album or the second album even if i don't end up reviewing it at least try it out to kind of see where where things are going I mean you know there are a number of artists that whose earlier stuff I hated and then I ended up like in their next album of vampire weekend for example didn't really care for the debut just thought like what is this duty you know this is just to you know kind of flurry for me you know it's too freely but uh but you know just ended up listening to the second album and I don't know if it was you know I know they changed a little bit on the second album but also you know I felt like I had changed but changed by the music just by giving it another shot you know giving it another chance let's take another question blue shirt and then white shirt very good question and something that I think also kind of goes back to the fact that trends are ever changing so much faster in the Internet age you can go back to you know if you think in your head hey dude tell me like the best like don't tell me like the best genre to come out of the 90s like the like one of the biggest or best Chandra's post-disco that's like a total liar so liar that dudes from mu mu planted him here and try to sabotage my show anyway you know and you think nine you think stuff like grunge man grunge came out in the 90s like because of the internet from now on I don't think you're ever going to have one genre defining a whole decade you know what I'm saying because people get tired of stuff fast you know you don't have the radio and you don't have MTV to constantly be hammering that stuff in your face over and over and over now radio and MTV are just taking songs and bands and artists that get popular on the internet first because the Internet is the perfect place to crash test things like that you know oh this is really popular now we didn't even need to spend a dime trying to promote them now we already know that they're popular let's do it you know let's get Kreayshawn on here she'll do that Gucci Gucci song kitty pryde two people go nuts mean kitty pryde her like Facebook each other it's weird like she was Facebook friends with me for like a year and that she did that video and I'd even know and then she's like oh yeah i watch your show unlike what really what's why like you're doing your cloud rap thing and she's like hey don't ever review my music I'm like why and she's like if you give it a bad review no one will listen to it anymore so inside info right there but i do think she's entertaining and i'm just going to leave it at that i'm trying to do a friend a favor all right um first live show I ever went to my dad's friend from work had Tesla tickets VIP seats saw Tesla dad was dead didn't even go dad totally let me hang out with his friend and his like like weird skeevy biker girlfriend and you know he's like this X rock drummer and like totally went to go see Tesla with them people at the VIP corner over there were like smoking pot and it was drifting over here they bought me a pretzel and I just you know I was like how old was I so like 13 maybe I was like 13 maybe and then you know that was the time that was the first rock band first rock band I wanted to see with my friends you know like a VFW show and just kind of seeing some local bands and stuff like that but also kind of like Aunt go back because I definitely wanted to finish answering the question that she asked I mean personally I think it's going to kind of be touch and go with with who is remembered 10 or 20 years from now I mean it's like you know there are bands out there kind of like animal collective and you know God's speed and radiohead that are still popular today but still kind of like you know go back before that Internet era before you know you had to be giving away your music for free in order for people to listen to it you know before that huge competition kind of bubble blew up before all of that you know it's like these bands don't really have to put out albums every single year in order to stay relevant you know they have that fact that they come from the past people who've been listening to their music love it and always sort of champion it they've had time because there was less music coming out at the time to sort of sit down and let it become a part of their lives whereas right now we're sort of listening to an album than just on to the next one on to the next one on to the next one and is that a terrible thing I don't know I do it and I'm happy you know you know I paid for the record you know the artist got their dough they're sort of you know I hope making a living you know it's it's not like in this day and age skipping to another record because you know I like it you know and just kind of feeling another mood is necessarily hurting the artist but um you know I I know for a fact that also a lot of people out there today are just not even really like i said earlier listening to complete albums but maybe more so just the songs that appeal to them most from those albums and kind of letting them stick to them and it's kind of funny how you can kind of take music and just sort of put it into the back of your head and just sort of apply it to time and apply it to time in relation to memory like I remember when I was listening to that new st. Vincent record strange mercy there was a certain guitar riff on there that totally just sounded like Dirty Projectors esque and just like like everything like 2009 came back it was like was like back to the future or something I was just like thinking a bit of Orca sing about posted on my shitty blogspot blog I was thinking about like you know how I had my furniture positioned at the time and who I was hanging out with like you know just just like weird stuff but I think because of how you know hyper-inflated the music industry is right now with artists it's going to be hard for us to kind of like be hey remember that band ten years ago you know it's like along with the ten thousand other bands that we listen to it's hard to kind of come out and define that thing you know because as soon as you come out with a style like you know little be with the whole cloud rap thing you get a dude like ASAP rocky who totally comes out of nowhere does the same thing you know with maybe a slightly cooler look and then people end up like in that more and you kind of you served you know what I mean it's like hyper hyper competition where as before when everything was controlled by the major labels in terms of who you're getting exposed to and who you listen to you know they control that you know we made sure we had one Nirvana you know we didn't sign the 10,000 other bands that sound like Nirvana we just wanted them you know now you can hear that band and the hundreds of other bands that sound like them to your leisure you know nobody's stopping you did I answer it okay okay another question Oh another question from the Twitter from the Twitter's the tweet people is Alec skinny who has the handle at Stu step and he asks you gave your first 10 out of 10 review this year is it still a 10 for you yes I am yes it is it's still attend for me like I said earlier you know I don't expect my opinion 30 years from now on that album to be the same you know I'm going to be a completely different person whether i want to be a completely different person or not you know i'm going to be a totally different person that music may still appeal to me but maybe not on the same level you know death grips the money store gave death grips the money store or 10 first 10 i ever gave to a new album you know and and sort of while we're you know on that topic of what a 10 is you know because people take the score so seriously i don't know why but you know a tent to me doesn't mean perfection it doesn't mean that you know you should drop everything you're doing and if you don't like this you're dumb and i hate you and i think you should just stop listening to music in general you know doesn't mean any of that i think with you know kind of giving a score like that people automatically assume that well if i don't like it he must think i have bad taste you know not the case you know it's just an album that appeals to me excites me that I enjoy to what I imagined to be my peak level of enjoyment and that's it you know so so yeah it is still a tent for me at the moment will that change eventually probably yeah but it's not going to change in like six months you know is I'm going to change in a year you know though my opinions on albums do change and I acknowledge that it's not something that usually just happens overnight you know it's something that usually happens with time whether it's for the better for the worse see another question yes mm-hmm I mean usually when I'm listening to an album I kind of liked to to the best of my abilities listen to it a little bit you know a few days before i'm going to be reviewing it you know maybe give it one cursory listen maybe in the background or in the foreground it just kind of you know at least know in my head what the style is I'm going to be going in for you know like oh this is this style you know I know this or I don't know this you know just kind of like acquaint myself with you know kind of what I'm going to be hearing then you know over the course of the next few days and I usually have some time you know throw it on my iPhone I'll be there in front of my computer burnin onto a CD put it in my car maybe I've got it on record you know just find some time no one I have the review up just actually going to listen to it all the way through and then maybe the day of the review actually you know kind of get it like a 4-2 like solid five listens if the album isn't like you know like for that swans record I had to be like doing some pre listening because that thing is two hours freaking long and that kralik's album that i'm going to be reviewing next was an hour long and you know sometimes albums like that can really just like take their toll on me but um you know basically as I'm doing that and kind of the day other review I'm just kind of like writing it out or as I'm listening at first you know just sort of like write an introduction and then just kind of leave my impressions for the album later you know because if i get that intro written out you know this bands from here and they've made this many records and this is their style and yada yada yada you know i can usually just like fly right into doing the review itself pretty easily because as I'm thinking about what the music is I hate thinking about what the band used to do you know because it's just so distracting it takes my mind away from from other things so as I'm kind of writing out mostly bullet points and just kind of like you know ideas and fractured sentences I'm listening sort of deciding individually how I like each track what I like about each track what I don't like about each track and then finally what I think about the album as a whole or the collection of songs or whatever and then from there just kind of like turn it on my canon t2i and kind of hooking it into my mac and uh you know shooting the video everything that I've read out you know kind of like get some Cal thing down playing the pan out say something ridiculous maybe respond to the band name being silly and you know just kind of thinking hard about you know because I know how people react to them you know what the score is going to be which I usually kind of accumulate due to whether or not I like every song I kind of look at every song individually and then I'm like mmm well you know it's like I hate this first part of the album i love this second part you know in the third parts great i'm going to kind of you know given that this part you know this section of third of it is this a third of its that a third of it is this i'm going to kind of give it this roundabout thing because i don't know i started doing that because i found that when I didn't think about it that way I was giving way more positive reviews than I think I would have otherwise because I would normally start writing the review and I would completely forget about all the things I hated and you know and the people would say but what about that part the you know I'm like yeah I didn't like that part at all actually a lot of parts i didn't like and then i would just like sort of realize that i actually didn't really like the album as much as i did this to me is sort of like i don't want to say it's accurate you know it's not the way everybody should approach reviewing anything but it's what works for me personally you know and then from writing the review and just sort of you know doing my best to sort of explain how i feel and why i feel that way just talking about it on camera throwing it into final cut putting it together if i actually have to end up cutting a sentence off you know or another sentence or cut that I did starts weird throw in one of those skippy edits and you know from there you know we have the review any part that seems like I skipped over no okay ah okay we're good was that goat was that for like 20 minutes was I talking for 20 minutes in the microscope I think a lot I think it has to do a lot more with the fact that access to recording technology is much cheaper than it used to be you can make an album on your laptop and even though a lot of people make terrible albums on their laptop you can make a great album on your laptop if you wanted to and have the you know some good microphones that you could buy for several hundred dollars at your local music store online that has definitely changed the process of making the album in a great way I mean you know and that has its pros and it's cons I mean if you make an album in a professional studio you may be working with a producer who actually knows their and knows how to record instruments and actually has great ideas for how a song should flow and build in the different sections for a song or you know you could kind of have an instance where you've got to do like the microphones you know Phil elver more or you know smog you know who make music themselves recorded themselves and don't do it in an orthodox way and because they're so outside of the normal rules of recording music they have a completely different and unique sound all their own you know the way certain things are mixed and the way certain instruments sound are due to the fact that they kind of experimented with recording music themselves so the art is changing because different things just like that loaf I craze that I mentioned earlier are you know kind of oh wow this sounds great you know it's like this would have never been made if you know somebody was like hey listen you know you would never make that album at a professional studio you know a dude who runs a board with looking like you're weird you know we're just like I don't know what you're doing it doesn't make sense to me but okay you know you don't necessarily need to pay thousands of dollars in a music studio to make music like that and it just ends up appealing to people I feel like that kind of has its ups and it's downs you know people kind of have less expectations for good sound quality but there is the opportunity to record something that's sort of outside of the box and really creative and new and kind of exciting you know so the art of the album has definitely changed in the recording aspect and you know I don't know if this is going to be worse into the future um but you know the the art of the making the album has definitely changed in the fact that you have to put out so much more material in order to stay relevant and have people thinking about you and actually interested in the music you're making you know there are so many rappers out there right now who just put out mixtape after mixtape after mixtape you know and and you know they know going into it that a majority of their fans are probably not going to like all the songs on the mixtape but just because it's free you know you just grab a few songs from it that you liked and you just kind of take it from there I mean you know especially in the case of a you know little be not that every single song he makes is terrible you know that's not what I'm trying to say but I mean The Dude's a genius when it comes to marketing his stuff you know he knows that you know the key to staying on top and the key to staying relevant just having people thinking about you and talking to talking about you is to always be putting out new material and is that going to have a positive or a negative effect on the quality of music we listen to overall I mean I don't know I think we're always going to have bands like you know a block party or you know arcade fire or something like that that put out albums every several years you know that people really anticipate and it's because they've they've sort of reached a certain level of popularity in order to you know be able to kind of live that lifestyle but you know who knows I feel like artists like that are going to be less and less into the future those still there because just the sheer amount of competition you I do mostly on the weekends when I actually kind of have an hour or so to myself a free hour you know because most days during the week I'm just kind of like waking up at 9am going to bed at 4am you know doing the review I was up that late in until I was doing the Krause review although I edited this morning because I was just like I got a migraine I was just the CT music awards I'm tired I'm just gonna go to bed you know but it's like it's a really demanding schedule and you know because of it I don't have a lot of time to listen to you know older albums or albums I may have on vinyl but when I do it's usually on the weekends and yeah I do listen to them whenever I get the chance okay I think I get you with independent music coverage increasingly going towards video is long form text criticism still relevant what you don't do basically is that still relevant um I think it's still relevant and I think it's still going to continue to be relevant it's just that you know there are tons of people who review stuff on video just like I do no matter what the topic is who do not get popular you know if what I did was the thing to do everybody who did it would be popular I mean you have to convey your feelings in a way that people can relate to if you could do that on text if you could do that via podcast or if you could do that via smoke signal you're going to have people who want to pay attention to that thing you know if you can convey feelings that people relate to and people can understand and just kind of you know project onto them and then they feel themselves then they're going to be interested you know like I said I feel it video is you know growing it's going to continue to grow and I feel like part of the reason I've seen the success that I have is that you know I consider myself a better talker than I do a writer you know I convey emotions better with my hands then I do text or anything like that you know I like person to person conversation I mean you know of course the YouTube videos aren't exactly that but when I'm making one or I'm sort of talking to the camera I imagine that I'm talking to a group about this size or something like that you know sort of giving a book report on an album a really awkward way but um but yeah you know if text is going to be relevant as long as there are people using text to convey feelings that people are interested in reading about I mean you know hipster runoff for example though a lot of people you know have said all over that website those websites crappier than it used to be you know they still go on it though but the thing is you know Carl's who writes that site or you know we still think writes that site you know has a certain style with how he writes and you know you go into that website expecting to read that style and you know even though he may say something that has been said a hundred times over because it's in that way where it's little comedic and it makes you sort of think about the situation a little bit it's more appealing than just reading that opinion somewhere else so yeah you know text and in every form of media i think is still going to be relevant and like i said just as long as people are still doing a good job of conveying their feelings through it in a way that people are feeling themselves last question the pressure couch esta solo album / EP all right to be completely honest I was sort of thinking about I might do some more shirts or something in the winter you know or something like that and what I may do is sort of like push Cal to do an album or something that people can like get for a free download along with a shirt or something like that you know I was thinking about that so you know something i was kind of plotting on so so so i'm thinking yeah thinking yes at the moment good done a blog on what if it's bad what if it's bad you heard that beat when I came out Cowell made that who like that that wasn't good one guy liked it got one fan in the room everybody else no hands so you're looking forward to this little forward to it okay and that's it that's forever thank you for coming everybody hopefully you enjoyed our talk with Anthony Fantana if you're interested in WSU we got table outside and hi to all the people watching on 4chan we saw your board all right good night "
JW5_AedbPa4,that they didn't really care for right now thanks to the internet you can listen to people your age and younger making psychedelic rock music that sounds like it was recorded in 1965 you know what I mean like everything is fractured everything is niche right now and and that's what makes today's musical day and age so interesting I mean so what if it's if it's like a total ripoff of this other thing that happened four years ago if it moves you you know if it means something to you you know and I think something that's like totally gonna happen like 15 years from now is kind of like when I went to high school there are these kids who like when I went to school and when I went to high school in the 90s they were totally like these kids my age you were like I don't listen to that radio stuff I listen to classic rock no my parents turned me on to that I listen to Led Zeppelin I'm listening to the Beatles that's real music you know like 10 15 years from now it's totally gonna be kids like I don't listen know that new hip hop I listen to NAS and Biggie and all that other stuff I'm into the classics stuff you know and that's fine you know but the thing is as music changes people are going to be attracted to certain kinds of music would no matter what kind of era it comes from and that's what's so awesome about the internet because it makes it easier now to do that you can go listen to something that came out in 1970 in 1980 and it's as if it kind of came out today you know you don't have that oh that's something that happens so long ago or that's something I can only hear if I listen to a certain radio station and they don't really play a lot of the music that I like I only like that one band from that one time period you know I mean you can kind of jump on the internet and just hear whatever and and really kind of put it here and and and now how long have I gone all right so I'm gonna get into quickly something that may be funny for a lot of you who is Cal to chesta does anybody want to know who couch your chest is get this question a lot people want to know the origins of couch esta okay origin of couch esta in under 30 seconds no all right so counter chesta kind of started when I kind of went on this binge watching and re watching the movie American movie has anyone seen that movie I'm gonna seen that film Wow nobody has seen American movie you've seen an American movie it's great it is great American movie is like this insane document documentary am I saying that right documentary sorry I've had four hours sleep can you tell this actually happens in the reviews and I cut it out is this insane documentary following the exploits of this dude from like the Wisconsin area trying to make this really short film and it's like this horror movie that you end up watching at the end of the movie and it's really bad and you know the dude despite the fact that like the movie makes is really bad he's just an insane guy he's insanely passionate he has like mom and his friends in the movie and you know they all kind of talk with this ex in over here you know especially his buddy who he went to high school with and he took a little too much drugs and is a little out of his mind because of it and they're just some really colorful characters and I remember as a joke at the pizza place where I work after a friend of mine were a friend of mine and I who works with me we're kind of fooling around you know my boss yellows and said only talk about business we're like all right so I started talking only about business in that accent so so then he started repeating it and then we would only talk about we would only talk in that accent you know just to like break our bosses balls and just be like hey you know oh hey you got that pizza over there it looks great you cooked that are real good okay so then we just talk back and forth and that accent just driver boss is nuts so then you know also kind of coming from this pizza place there's a lot of people there's people from Peru and there's people from Mexico and there and there's people from El you know the Eastern Bloc in there as well as Italians and there's a lot of like language mixing and like a lot of people saying each other's languages like incorrectly and I remember you know one one kind of thing that gets thrown around a lot Scot chooce so and which which the meaning escapes me at the moment but I think it's just like you know what's up but um tell me if I'm wrong but anyway you know to me that oh that someone else mispronounced it is something else and I remember like hey you know all this like ridiculous well it kind of sounds like names or something I remember one thing that my boss always says an agenda mode on where you kind of taking the mother Mary's name in vain and you know we just said what do you say John Marone you know it's like who the hell's that you know just like breaking balls again and then that other phrase kind of turned into Cal Church s tone we just kind of made ridiculous names after all these phrases that people are always saying just because we're totally bored and nobody's buying pizza no people actually do buy a lot of pizza but anyway so then from there you know I kind of recently had just hit 222 subscribers on YouTube and I just thought is like a ridiculous joke to you know do an interview with with me because I'm so famous now and you know I knew I needed a character to kind of ask me questions and then I just kind of came up with the you know Cal to chest a character to ask me these questions I got a fake mustache and just thought how else I'm gonna make me look different I don't have like a wig or anything you know I just put out on I just put on a button-down shirt and then you know just kind of did that accent clothes squid in my eyes partially because to do the character I had to take my glasses off and you know just sort of like took that to the next level and it just kind of got ridiculous and people are like I love this guy but the thing is like what's so funny is like the character the whole concept of the character and the dynamic of what I do with that character is so inspired just like so engrained into me already because he's so like he's the heifer to my Rocko he is like the Stimpy to my Ren he is like the Daggett to my Norbert your Norbit I can't remember his name like I haven't watched angry beavers in a while just like all these Nickelodeon cartoons that like came out from the 90s in the early 2000s you know I mean you guys could say Patrick and SpongeBob as well you know it's just like just come up with this clueless funny character that you know doesn't know anything about any constantly mispronouncing everything and I just kind of always get mad at him you know it's like I kind of figured that it wouldn't be funny if I didn't get angry even though I'm not really a a extremely angry person you know I just figured I have to have this guy say something so dumb that it was just like annoy you if he was real you know and people ask me all the time you know and it kind of becomes a game like hey why are you so mean to couch Chester why can't you be nice to him just be nice to him he sees funny he's a lovable guy you know but that you know kind of also adds to the to the other joke that I have in my head that it's like everybody hates you know a critic everybody thinks I'm a critic you can't like a critic a critics a jerk so I have to be like mean to him I have to be hateable when it comes to you know him even though he's dumb you want to love him and you want to take him home and you want to cuddle them you know make him feel okay and you know that sort of seems to be just the rundown of what I do how I do it who is couch your chesta why I do what I do and how I started so I want to open the floor up for the cues and A's I'm gonna answer so many Q's I'm gonna try to get as many AIDS as possible without looking like an a-hole what is it yeah yeah we'll be taking audience questions from you guys I mean I thought they knew that already I'll be only answering questions from people who are not you know not true okay so I mean if you raise your hand we will pass you the mic okay we got a question right mom's right there with stepdad Brian right there hands up and big man in the back with my stepmom Marsha I have to tell them people ask me all the time gets so many comments that are like what nationality are you Asian yeah that's like 1/4 Sicilian 3/4 french-canadian and that's it that's how I'm not Asian as most people think I don't know like I even went to a party once and this drunk asian dude said like I remember somebody made some stupid Asian joke and he's like there's another Asian guy right there and I'm like come on you know it's like I don't know it's like you don't think I look Asian do you it's like I don't look Asian you know I don't know but people just you know people who don't have I guess a lot of experience with Asian people think I'm Asian or something I don't know I mean I'm sure to Asians I don't look Asian you know I think you know I never had an Asian person telling me except that drunk guy but I think was most because he was drunk so anyway next good question right now I make money off of Adsense ads that run on the blog you know there's sort of those embedded ads as well as YouTube ads run before the YouTube videos you kind of get those text ads on the videos after a certain amount of subscribers on YouTube and pretty much about any major video website they will kind of partner you and allow you to start making a hat revenue off of those videos and with every you know amount well with every extra view you get you know that's sort of more revenue for you and I am just sort of like kind of approaching the area where I can kind of do this as a full-time job I mean right now I could probably scrape by and what I do simply on YouTube but you know I like having you know a good amount of groceries at the end of every week and you know that's basically the the how of it I mean it's just sort of generating enough subscribers and views on your videos to the point where they want to approach you to monetize that video they're also you know standalone websites where you can kind of host video on there and they'll run ads on it for you video is really on the internet kind of a burgeoning business so many websites especially music websites out there are trying to go video you guys I'm sure a lot of you who go on pitchfork you've seen pitchfork kind of revamp pitchfork TV after stopping it for a while and that's because people really kind of want to connect with the artists and in the music that they are listening to on a deeper level you know that people in music you know especially in today's day and age are so image oriented you know people are so easily persuaded by someone who looks cool someone who looks sexy someone who looks nerdy and because of that you know it's like it's it's nice to have the video element there it's definitely a growing thing I mean most people right now if any of you have seen the recent radio oriented video that I put out recently most people right now are getting a majority of their information still from radio and television but when you take that demographic down to teenagers and 20 things the Internet as far as at least you know getting exposed to new music it's in like the 60 percentile it's in the 70 percentile people using YouTube and using you know websites like Spotify and stuff like that to find out about new music and as soon as you know all those people older than us go off to a better place you know you guys will still probably using the internet to find out about things that are relevant to you and you know just imagine people who are younger than you being even more in tune to the Internet you know once they have I don't know Google bringing microchip or whatever that you installed in your head and you know you just like browse the Internet while you know goofing off in class or something like that so that's kind of how I make money right now at the moment I know where I am it's gonna be growing you know more people are going on YouTube every day to look at video content and that's basically how people are stumbling upon what I do because part of the another part of the reason that I started just talking about music in video is that not only did I see nobody was talking about music in video on the blogosphere but I also had noticed that hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people go on YouTube every day just to stream music in comparison with Pandora Spotify all those music streaming websites that are legal YouTube's music plays only the legal music plays though dwarfed their numbers by ten times you can combine all their numbers together in YouTube's plays just the legal play is the songs that are uploaded on YouTube legally dwarfed all those numbers combined you know and there's not really any show of that kind of switching anytime soon because people get so much more access to songs on YouTube that they wouldn't hear anywhere else you know even though it's not technically supposed to be that kind of website next question what do I use to get my new music good question I use a bunch of blogs that I have linked on my blog that I read on a weekly or bi-weekly basis as well as you know a few websites that I kind of have album listings on but I also get PR email sent to me promo sent to me but the biggest and greatest source of recommendations and just sort of like you know mmm ideas as to what's good and what could be covered as from you guys when you guys email me and tweet at me and just sort of send me YouTube messages I mean that kind of lets me know when something is either really really I mean like really authentically hot and you're interested in that and that's really popular right now because you know Stereogum and five other blogs that are just as popular can blog about something and I mean I'll tell you happens all the time nobody cares you know I don't get not one message about it sometimes it ends up in something that I actually end up liking and I'm surprised nobody really took two and sent it to me but I mean you know messages from the people who watch on a day-to-day basis are extremely valuable when it comes to you know knowing what's actually relevant to the people who view and that's and that's pretty much how you know I find out about new music and from you know friends and people who are kind of colleagues of mine who I know also run blogs whose tastes I kind of take very seriously but you know that's that's a majority of it and and I follow a lot of record labels too you know at least like you know several dozen record labels maybe even more maybe even at least like more than 50 you know record labels of various genres two dudes together you on you first and then him honestly I've never been like huge into pinback so my feeling is on them reuniting you know it's like I can't really say but it's like I kind of made this video once about how I feel about people reuniting in general and it's like you know there's kind of the tendency to be really like hyped up on it and excited and you know it doesn't always end up as being disappointing but like you know it's it's good to be excited about your favorite band getting back together I mean you know I'd love to see Neutral Milk Hotel put on a new record but you know I'm not sure if that's gonna happen but uh you know it's a but me personally about pinback reuniting it's like you know I even whether I'm a fan of the band or not I'm usually pretty mm-hmm I'm just gonna see where this goes you know oh yeah live music is incredibly important because not only did that friend of mine you know turn me on to punk music by just going over to his place you know and just kind of like hearing some records and stuff like that but you know when I was much younger in my teen years and I was you know telling these guys over here over over dinner that in waterbury you know there were quite a few shows going on in VFW's at the time and I'm sure a lot of you guys maybe have gone to like manic production shows I mean you know mark is like the mark manic mark is the same age as me and it's like you know when he was booking shows I was kind of growing up going to a lot of his shows he took a lot of hardcore and punk shows over at the VFW in Wallingford but in Waterbury you know kids from wool kid and prospect and Waterbury two would kind of like you know booked some bands that were in their high school and just kind of like charge five bucks at the door and then you know you'd see some people who bought amps down to say mash turn them all the way up and just go work you know at the time hatebreed was pretty big so there were a lot of bands copying that metalcore sound and you know some like screamo core bands and stuff like that a few bands that were like copying tool you know things of that nature I mean not a lot of just like hardcore punk I mean I think I saw a few bands like that at those of you have double use but you know I was going mostly to metal shows and just sort of like being able to kind of the camaraderie around music in person and see people moshing and having fun I mean that's always great I mean you know being a fan of a record or even hating a record can always be enhanced or your mind can totally be changed by seeing a live show but I mean you know just live music in general especially in an age where so many people are just like listening to tunes off of their iPod and off of their laptop speakers being able to go to a show and like actually feel you know the physical sound hitting you and you know everybody around you enjoying it at the same time can be a really extremely fun thing like an entirely new experience and in viewing the music in a completely different light so I mean live music is immensely important and it's something that I urged that that you guys make sure you support the best that you can even though we're in an age where record sales are kind of on the decline thanks to pirating and just the sheer number of artists out there right now kind of giving each other competition mom-mom has a question okay um no I have no clue I mean you know right now I'm at the point where like you know once in a while I will get an email from somebody who works at a PR firm who are promoting a band were like hey you got a review that album you know where as before they didn't really care so I guess I have some kind of impact you know once in a while an artist will come to me and say hey that album review you did for me two years ago like I still get traffic from that you know or you know people still bring that up to me I mean it's like you know you could put something on the internet now and still three years later people could be seeing an impact I mean after Danny Brown talked about me and that ASAP Rocky interview that him and ASAP rocky did I still get comments today they're like yo Danny Brown shouted you out and you know you have to be nice you know you can't be like I saw that dickhead you know it's like I saw it that was funny you know those for the hundredth time but it's like you know but I mean you know I understand the excitement when the first time I saw it I was like what what no way but yeah hopefully I got invited to see him over here so you know maybe get the chance to see his you know missing tooth in person I'm just kind of hear that fiery flow and see that crazy hair but um but yeah mom totally cannot I don't know if I'm selling a lot of albums or anything like that right now so just just as far as fixing pirating and everything like that I mean things have definitely moved in an interesting direction I mean when I was younger if you wanted to hear music you had to pay if you wanted to hear it you had to pay for it and people were older than me as well unless you went over to a friend's house to listen to it now listening is free listening is completely free I mean you could listen wherever there are tons of websites right now or you don't even need to pyrin you can just stream it online and just listen at your leisure owning it is what costs money you know and if you don't like it well then of course you don't buy it I mean back when listening is what costed money you had to buy it and then find out after whether or not you liked it and then try to get four bucks for it down at the strawberries or the FYE you know because they're not gonna sell back to you had a good price no they are not so you know that was kind of your options and and right now especially given that you can go on the internet I mean you anybody like can go on the internet put up an album and they want that album to be heard I mean you know they don't have a record label behind them they want people to hear the music you know they think that their musics great and it has you know just as much merit as anybody else's music the best and easiest way to you know kind of let people hear your music is just to let them stream it just to let them download it just give it away for free if you want people to listen to it and share it and because of that I mean even though we personally perceive some music to be better than others you know other music and because of that we perceive the music we like to have more value it's kind of brought down the overall value of music you know entirely because there's just so much competition out there you know imagine if there were as many you know aspirin companies out there as there are you know bands and rappers and electronic music producers I mean you'd be paying a cent for a bottle you know but it's that's not the case you know and and the thing is like it doesn't even make sense to you know charge that price for aspirin because it costs so much more to make you know it's like there's a certain level of competition in that industry that there can be you know in music there's like unlimited because it all just comes from you you know as long as you have the instruments and the passion to make the music it's pretty much free to make you know so because of that just the mere plethora of everything out there even music that we think is great you know the overall value has gone down because the fact that you can go on the internet in search of music of every genre in every style you could find way more albums today that you think are amazing that you could have found 15 to 20 years ago you know because your resources to find out about them would have been limited to the radio TV music magazines and things like that yes what do I see this changing an independent music I mean the biggest thing to me that that is changing and like independent music is just style what people prefer you know I mean I remember when I was in college and I was listening to a lot of you know indie bands just at that time Indy had become like a style like a sound it became sort of like Arcade Fire and Death Cab for Cutie and Modest Mouse and stuff like that whereas before hand independent music just meant you were on an independent label or unsigned it didn't mean you had a certain sound it didn't mean you sounded a certain way you know and now I feel like things like indie folk and you know indie rock and and things of that nature things that would have been just like huge back when when I was going to college are just you know slightly less interesting to a lot of new music listeners now you know things more like I don't know it's not a genre but like swag rap you know and like dubstep you know that stuff is hot right now even though dubstep was around when I was in college and you know I thought it was okay but now dudes like James Blake and Skrillex have kind of like reinvented it into something that sounded way different than it did in 2001 and now it's sort of like hot all of a sudden so it's like you know a trend can come out of nowhere you know something that's been around for 10 years or more you know so to me I mean all those things that I just said about the price of music that's definitely a huge huge change the amount of musicians and bands out there also a huge change but just trends you know are ever-changing and if there is another huge change that I should note it's that the Internet has definitely accelerated the speed at which things go out of style I mean you know who's still listening to there chill wave albums anybody still listen to there chill wave anybody still pop that washed-out on every once in a while you listen to that Loma Prieta  and you're like but don't but don't like then you just vibe out like that okay all right I think of you could take a few Twitter questions okay so this is from Twitter user use why us and then his handle is used to not use okay and he says do gimmicks have a place in music I'm talking about bands band names like young magic Grimes shoulder mic stand etc etc oh man like gimmicks have a huge place in music and the thing is gimmicks though people react to the word gimmick badly I mean it's not necessarily a bad thing I mean a bunch of dudes getting together and spitting on these kind of like beats that the sample karate movies and spend about like doing sword isn't a gimmick you know of course it's a gimmick of course it's a concept but that doesn't mean it's bad that can make an album funny that can make an album entertaining I mean the issue comes into play when you basically have a gimmick but you don't really have the music or you don't really have the foresight or you don't really have you know an idea or a concept outside of the gimmick you do the one thing and that's the one thing that you do and the thing is you know a gimmick can be really great for an album you know it can be really great to start out with but as soon as you put out that second that third album especially in the Internet age where people get tired of past you know people are really quick to be like you know whatever you know I've heard this already you know I've heard the gimmick it was fun two years ago but I kind of want something else new now you know just like I was saying with that chill wave thing you know loaf I kind of came and went I remember when waves blew up like I was getting 30 emails in my inbox today like we're low five and we're a little five and we play lo-fi it's like of course you do you were playing low five before waves blew up to you like you record like really badly but now it's sort of like now it's in fashion to be recording really badly and there's still a lot of good badly recorded music out there you know it's just that you have to have more than being low fie you know to be good you have to be more than a seapunk my friend you know yeah let's do another tour just one more let's do one more okay anybody here go on mu he's saying new I like saying mu I've been going on there since 2006 I've only called it mu they're called mutants or muffins or muchachos anybody go on you Bam Bam Bam Bam you filthy animals there's this music board that is on the website 4chan it's called mu I call it mu its letters mu that's why I call it that I don't care mu they're probably gonna leave some nasty comments on my videos or thumb them down or like hacked my YouTube account and just like put pictures of kittens being destroyed or something I don't know but anyway this music board that I've been frequenting for a very long time I remember like oh this music board is so funny man it's like I should try to make a joke that people will repeat all the time and it'll be funny you know and be this make a meme that everybody will think is cool on this board then then I'll be the cool guy and then I remember for awhile I didn't go on there and then it's like I ended up being that joke on the board so it's like you know so now pictures are come always like you know really like pictures of me like this you know like all over the board pictures of coucher chests you know count Cheska like all these memes all these jokes and it's like you know hey you know it's like hey what you think of that album oh it's such a light three you know or something like that you know it's it's it's funny how people can kind of take something you make and they're just kind of

that Loma Prieta shirt oh man I'm like surprised people showed up to this I'm like totally stoked on this alright so this is like what I had an idea for I'm going to talk about what I do how I do it how I started why I do it and who is cow does that sound good not a good run down for everybody a little good like itinerary does anybody opposed that show hands up opposition okay good alright what I do I do a thing that should never even really be a job and yeah it's like a job I review music all the time on the Internet daily basis just kind of give my opinion honesty honesty honesty honesty how I really feel just don't even care whether or not it pisses somebody off or make somebody happy I'm just sort of telling I can't say BAE because it's you you're there and you're the guys you're the ladies and gentlemen to watch just sort of tell people how I really feel and I guess like I'm flabbergasted that I've even been kind of semi successful at it because I made my start in radio started going to school at w.w started going working at a radio station in wsin on the southern Connecticut State University campus I was the music director over there general manager for two years and after that I just kind of had hopes given the education I was kind of giving myself to go work at a radio station either as a DJ or as like a reporter or something like that I got any turn ship over WNPR in Hartford where I still work part-time and at the time they had just gone from being in all classical station to an all talk and news station and so because of that they were they were repeating a lot of programming and I just kind of made some demos for the general manager and you know for a music show kind of featuring one album for like half an hour or just kind of talking about the inner workings of it introducing songs or just talking about the dynamics of it the history of the band and all that stuff and the general manager lo and behold liked it ended up being a podcast on their website and eventually I think later that year and this is like in 2007 maybe toward the beginning of 2008 just turned into a half an hour show on the air and you know I was just kind of making the radio show that I I deal II would love to hear on the radio um not a lot of talking you know just some introduction and information always say the name of the song because I hate when that happens and your song that you like and you don't know what it is and you know just kind of do that but you know after after a while of doing it I just wasn't getting anywhere wasn't kind of making a living off of it just kind of wondering how the hell am I going to move out of my mom's house you know doing this show that isn't really getting me anywhere and then from there the the news director over at WNPR urged me to get on the internet start putting some stuff up on the internet get your podcasts up there let him know you're there and so I just decided to start a blog you know with the needle drop and at the time I didn't know about blogs and covering music on the internet and know about any of that like you know I would put typos in there spell things wrong misinformation screw up a million times and then I found that there are like five hundred million approximately other websites on the Internet covering music already dear much like hey gonna get anywhere that's a lot of competition and I don't know I don't have any money you know it's like I work part time it's a place still work part-time at a pizza place only on the weekends now though used to be like five six days a week cutting those days down hopefully by the end of the year no more pizza no more pizza though I just got a tattoo over here to like commemorate it like ten years in pizza first job I ever had and I'm like still working it but you know as I'll talk about later that's kind of like if you really want to chase your dreams you know some that's something you may have to do I have to work this crappy job every day every other day just to kind of so I could do this thing so anyway so so I was at the radio station news director told me to start a blog got up there realize there are all these websites oh my god there's Stereogum oh my god there's pitchfork oh my god there's guerilla bears like how am I gonna compete with all these sites you know how am I gonna compete with the hipster runoffs of the world and I don't know with no budget I'm just like well let's just try something different I've never seen anybody on the blogosphere throughout the months that I've spent on it talk about an album on camera and I swear to God I would never touch a camera again after I took a news television news course at southern with a professor named Jerry Dunkley very imposing man because he knows his but you know after screwing up in his class so many times I'm like never gonna touch a camera again I don't need to be on camera I have a degree in radio I studied radio all this time but now radio is kind of like and so I have to go on the internet now - kind of like experiment make a living and just from there like I remember in a few short months sort of like got a hundred subscribers I was kind of making these really dingy videos in my basement had this long-winded introduction you know and really kind of like making these funny little jokes sketches oriented around these albums not really giving an opinion or anything like that and it was just kind of like attracting a few eyes here and there and you know I remember when I got my first hundred subscribers I was psyched I was like yeah this is going somewhere in that blog I'm stopping the radio show this doesn't make any sense I'm on like you know the fast track right now hundred subscribers that's hundred people it's like at least 100 people in this room right I don't know maybe you guys were the first hundred my mom my mom does not my mom subscribed so that was definitely one of the first hundred my dad recently got YouTube so now he's subscribed both in the house right now mama and papa Fantan oh so I mean you know from there just making these really dingy videos and just kind of getting you know a few comments here and there people are like yeah like you know that was a funny thing but what do you think about the album you know and then I was like flabbergasted I was like why do you care like what do you think about the album like why should you give a what I think you know I mean that's kind of what I thought about my radio show you know I give my opinion I mean obviously I like it since I'm playing it no reason to go into detail as to why I like it you know I just thought people would prefer you know the music just listen to the music but no it turns out people like something too I agree with that you know so much you know why do you hate Animal Collective why don't you like the new Radiohead you know people like something you know David Anthony that Kanye album rules and you know it's it's an it's just an opinion it's just an opinion but sometimes people take it too seriously you know they take it too far and what's actually kind of funny and ironic is that you know I see a lot of music websites out there that just give one positive review after another to every single thing like every single thing is the greatest thing in the world and for some reason like the reviews that I make that generate the most traffic and like get the most eyes are the ones that are like negative you know and I don't want it to be that way but it is like you know I could say like this obscure album that I just reviewed you know I'm gonna review this Crowell s album tonight videos totally all rendered gonna upload it gonna give it like a strong eight I think it's an awesome black metal album but like it's but you know if I say the new 2 Chainz album sucks and most people on the planet who watched the review are already going into the review knowing they don't like it and they already know I'm not gonna like it but they'll go on and we'll see yeah that album sucks good job Anthony so basically what I do is that that's what I do I upload videos onto YouTube like on a regular basis and just sort of let you guys know what I think and you know I've had a lot of time over the several years that I've been doing this to kind of think about why you know what I do matters to a lot of people and like you know why sort of telling a lot of you guys what I think about an album whether it's good or bad is is more important than just sort of putting up a blog and then just kind of like linking you to the mp3 and then you can kind of listen to it at your leisure I mean I remember when I was in high school I started out listening to like a lot of new metal loved Marilyn Manson he was awesome he was the like after I did that Marilyn Manson review I so went on Amazon and bought a copy of Antichrist Superstar for like 5 bucks like use copy it's like sitting in my music collection now you know nostalgia you know it's totally like in a rage against the machine which I still think is cool that like you know drowning Pool and Mudvayne and it's funny people like still come to me and ask me about those bands that they're like you know teenagers and they're like hey what do you think of Mudvayne I'm like man you you're like that was when I was your age like listening to that but but anyway like I remember this turning point came when a friend of mine named Derek who said he was gonna be here but he didn't show up but it's okay I love you anyway bro you know it was like you know he like looked at my CD collection like back in the day before we had mp3 players you know we had discman brought them to school and we had like these headphones that like wrapped around the back of your head made you look real cool and you know basically we had like you know these these little CD books which now if I see a CD book I'm like there is nothing good in that like you know that's like the number-one rule of a CD book like I'm sorry too anybody goes and just breaking balls you know it's it came down genetically for my father so you know blame him after the show so I had these CD books and you know I remember a friend of mine named Derek you know he looked at and he's like don't you listen to anything before like 1999 I'm like you know it's like that was the only band I like came out of the 90s that I listened to so he's like okay you know what I'm gonna burn you a CD because everything here sucks you know the fact that you listen the Coal Chamber sucks I'm gonna burn you some Black Flag and some Dead Kennedys and some Ramones and some freaking the WHO and Led Zeppelin and I'm like yeah sure okay you know so he makes me this like to CD compilation and I'm like dude this is the worst music on the planet like how could you how could you even like any of this and he's like I think it's great you know but then I remember this one song from the Dead Kennedys like off their album in god we trust' incorporated we got a bigger problem now which is kind of like a reworking of the song California ooh BRR alles which is you know in that song they're kind of singing about the Governor of California but on that we've got a bigger problem now they're singing directly about Ronald Reagan you know and I remember that song like it was the best recorded song out of the bunch and for some reason the intensity of that song just hit me and from there I was just like kind of going back you know kind of taking the speed and kind of taking just like the the the rough guitar playing from that song kind of like you know listening to in the other songs I'm like okay hey this misfits song isn't like so bad you know this other you know band isn't so bad you know this vibrator song is pretty cool and from there just kind of being like okay like what the hell is punk you know and then just like going over to his house he had all these records like listening to one record after another it was totally having my mind blown and you know much like that person that was talked about before you know I came onto the stage like I guess what I'm doing to an extent you know not in a hey let's hang out listen to some records kind of way is is kind of doing that for some people you know hey you know I'm turning you on all this music I'm telling you what's good in my opinion and that's sort of allowing you to you know sort of say well I take this person's opinion seriously he sort of seems to you know be passionate about what he's saying I mean I like to think I'm more passionate than I am knowledgeable I mean you know I I have I care about music you know I love music I love listening to it all the time people ask me if I ever get tired of listening to music and I don't I mean only music I don't like but you know being there to kind of open somebody up to a different kind of music that they never heard before it could totally potentially change the way they think and the way they view the world and that's exactly what happened to me when a friend of mine had turned me on to punk music because it just signaled to me that hey you know this thing is obscure nobody knows about this and yet it's like a really great idea you know and from there you know I kind of went to think well here's this underground version of rock is there like this underground more obscure version of this other genre that you know I haven't heard of before that's really cool you know you run across people all the time that say I hate country and hip hop or you know I totally don't listen to metal metals for children or what's that hipster that you're listening to you know but the thing is if you can get past whatever initial problems you have with a genre there's got to be some band or song in there that you've never heard of before that will just totally maybe even just make you like the genre as a whole as you've never liked it before I uh mean I remember when I got older and after I got into punk music I was like you know getting that punk ideology totally anti materialism bah bah bah and as a result I just thought all hip-hop was like crap you know and I just thought well you know I mean this ethic I'm into this ideology you know it's like hearing people but rap about money on the radio isn't we're on that dog but then you know from there you know researching on the internet talking to people at the college that I started going to about you know hip-hop and I was getting turned on to old school stuff like Gang Starr and wu-tang and and stuff like what else am i thing the Public Enemy you know who I loved throughout college thought Public Enemy was the and you know what I think is really awesome is that now you know especially now in my opinion kind of going off topic a little bit I think because of the internet hip-hop is kind of having a punk revolution at the moment where you have all these smaller artists right now kind of coming up and giving the bigger artists huge competition and rapping about things that are outside of the normal ideology of the hip-hop that you hear about on the radio and not just necessarily from you know the backpackers standpoint that people would always kind of label socially conscious hip-hop within the 2000s but you know kind of rapping about weird or just like wacky stuff like Odd Future or gasps racist you know it all doesn't have to be about one thing so gonna go back to my notes because I'm pretty sure I touched down on the what I do think pretty hardcore all right let me see how I do what I do geez I mean people ask me all the time how do I listen to music what do I use to listen to it I mean it's not really a big thing you know it's just sitting there and concentrating and just kind of thinking about what you're listening to you know thinking about it in the same way that you would a movie but often today because of all the distractions digital distractions that we have around us especially you know and I'm not you know making an anti-technology stance right here you know just kind of saying that with power comes responsibility with the you know thing in your hand that has you know 200 or 300 songs on it you could listen to any of them but you know how often you actually listen to an album all the way through sitting down and thinking of it as a whole you know doesn't happen as much these days as it did back in the day unfortunate we but that's pretty much how I do you know it's like I'm just sitting down and thinking about what I'm hearing I'm thinking about how I feel about it you know and I'm thinking about what in the music makes me feel that way is it a certain melody is it a lyric is that the production is that the personality of the music is it the chord progression I mean what is it you know I mean of course you're having a reaction to a certain thing in a song or in an album whether you hate it or whether you like it you know how often you actually think about what in the music is actually making you feel that way I mean that to me is the easiest way to open yourself up to other genres because if you're into a certain kind of characteristic or certain kind of instrument or a certain kind of you know tonality in a song you could find that in other genres that you wouldn't usually find yourself listening to you know so basically when I'm sitting down and just listening to what I'm listening to I'm just thinking about it writing some notes just kind of finding out inside me how I really feel about it and what makes me feel that way if I can't tell you guys what is making me feel a certain way about an album I don't review it yet you know and that's it and a lot of people come back and ask me you know hey you gave this a negative review you know do you actually like it now or do you like it less now I mean I find often that when I make my year-end list and I hate making lists of albums that I think are great you know I often have to like rearrange things you know according to just how I feel about them at that time and that's the thing like things will grow on you and things are going to fade away you know people sort of approach me and expect that if I think this album is the most amazing thing of all time I'm always gonna think it's the most amazing thing of all time forever despite the fact that I say that at the end of my videos that's not the case I mean opinions and your feelings of music are so so so based on your genetics and your just internal wiring and where you are in life and and all that stuff and you know and and how you perceive music in general and the kind of things that you want to hear I mean I have friends that you know have totally turn their backs on certain bands not because they put out a terrible album but you know they've listened to it too many times they don't want to listen to that anymore I mean that very same friend of mine who you know turned me on to punk music years and years and years later I found out about the band crass and I was like holy you know it's like this is some dirty weird like anti-establishment freaky stuff you know and like really great album called penis envy that they have out you know really great like kind of artsy post-punk female vocals on there it's it's a really rowdy album but I remember showing it to men he's like this is okay you know whereas I know if I had found out about that when we were much younger he would have been like everything got to get a shirt with that you know who's gonna see the misfits in New Britain on the 30th go see Jerry only I watch your skull but they will not play anything off of Earth ad which pisses me off it's like my favorite misfits album they never play anything offer ad the new misfits so you know basically that's kind of in my opinion how I do what I do you know opinions are ever-changing opinions are not static things I mean I like to think of my reviews personally it's just kind of being how I felt about something at the time do I worry about 30 years from now am I going to put on Death Grips the money store and think this is you know I don't because there's no use in it I mean you're never gonna feel the same way about an album forever and if you are I mean I think it's because you've stopped listening because I mean you should always be turning yourself on to new stuff always be into new things and introducing yourself to new things even and you know if you kind of feel deep inside of you 20 years from now you have that thing like when I was a kid we had music you know what I mean not this you know what I mean I feel like there's there's a bit of that now when you know there are some dudes who are older fans of certain kinds of music you know maybe 10 or 15 years older than me and then all like something like tonight you know anybody listen to that new EP they put out like a lot of loud banging electronic music on there with not a lot of you know not a lot of complications on there just brow brow I remember somebody wrote in there's one music video they put online where like some dude is we're in like a needle drop t-shirt at the end like you can catch that and like I remember after I reviewed it like a few days later the top comment on that video top thumbed up comment was Anthony Fantana throwing dollar bills at strippers like that that's like that's like the soundtrack and if I was going to do that I gotta agree you know like I mean honestly it's like it you know it's it's it's like colorful and weird but the thing is like you know people who are older and you know grew up with like acid house and tech house and like you know stuff like that or like Anthony if you grew up during you know the 90s and was listening to prodigy and stuff like that you wouldn't like this you know and maybe you're right you know but that's not where I am so who cares you know I still like that you know what you're just brought up but it doesn't mean I can't like this other thing you know and and that's another thing do not get yourself bogged down and like okay like I hear a song that is soft that is delicate and is beautiful and because I like all those things I have to not like anything that is the antithesis to that you know I can't like something that's loud and harsh and fast and you know screaming and things like that you know I'm into the and that's good you know that's that's really good but the thing is you know you can't just turn yourself off to the opposite just because you're into the one thing and you know these are the things that I'm always thinking of when I am thinking of whether or not I like an album am I am i disliking this because of some kind of bias am i disliking this because it's or am i liking this because it's just something I've never heard before but then maybe five weeks down the road I'm gonna think oh that's pretty bad you know keep yourself open to different kinds of music especially as you grow older and I think it's going to be easier to do that as you use the internet because you know a lot of people who are older than you pretty much had to rely on the radio to turn themselves on to new music and of course as soon as the kind of music they grew up with went out of style they were forced to listen to you know this other stuff right now that "
sR8LEe8pjMs,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new how to dress well LP total loss to my right your left we can see couchy chesta dressed in one of the finest polo shirts known to man coming straight from the Anthony Fan Tan Oh dresses like a total nerd collection and has no fashion sense whatsoever which is most likely why he wears graphic tees all the time we can also see him adorned in a beautiful little sweater vest right there wonderful our guy'll pattern which is getting messed up in green screen a little bit but you know that's that's the way the cookie crumbles I just said that how to dress well is the project of singer and producer Tom Krell who made quite the polarizing full-length debut with the album love remains which he kind of built up to with a series of EPs and this LP was was really great at just gathering attention because of the unique musical and and stylistic approach it had just incredibly low fire recordings of falsetto vocals slathered and reverb singing over beats and a very very clear R&B influence coming through on almost everything he was doing the album was just dark and murky and and moody it was like listening to prints going through a severe depression and I did really liked his style and in a lot of ways you could say that this dude was ahead of the curve when it comes to all the experimental and and forward-thinking R&B wvwv artists that are out there right now but I did not like the recording quality at all I like the style I like the direction I continued to keep my ear to the ground with this project I was very impressed with the EP that was released shortly after this album would which had orchestral versions of the suicide drain tracks that love remains album that sounded beautiful also last year how to dress well was featured on one of my favorite singles of 2011 active child's playing house the track was just smooth atmospheric slow-motion R&B with just sexy as hell vocals lush and glistening instrumentation with synthesizers that had kind of a retro feel to them you know if he could pull off something like that I know I would like his next album and with total loss lo and behold we do get a better recorded and in a lot of ways more realized version of how to dress well not only that but the moods between this LP and and love remains are almost night and day love remains being much more noisy experimental in just dark while this has a really kind of heavenly quality to it there's still a really strong R&B influence I would argue that maybe it comes out even stronger in a popular fashion on some of these tracks but the atmosphere the ethereal atmosphere surrounding the instrumentation on these songs sometimes even has like a new-age music quality to them overall sonically this is definitely an improvement for how to dress well but I kind of feel like these improvements do come with their own set of cons even with the massive amounts of reverb on some tracks here there are just no veils to hide behind on total loss which is kind of making me re-evaluate how I feel about the music and the vocals now that I feel like I'm getting a full picture of them and I got to say sometimes the music sometimes the vocals they are on and they are off when how to dress well is on fire it's on the track cold nights I love the distance synthesizers just hidden in the atmosphere on that track they're really dramatic piano and the and the lumbering beat but now that I hear Krauss voice just front and center it kind of exposes that the falsetto that he always sings and doesn't really have a natural grace to it or anything like that I mean I pick up a lot of points where he is straining and consistently I don't really think he has all that much power volume wise when it comes to singing with this falsetto there's no real force behind it still that doesn't keep cold nights from being a great track for me mostly because there are other things to hear and focus on later on the LP and it was you just has Crowell singing raw over these looped finger snaps and you just really just hear his voice that's it he's singing with a bit more energy just a bit more get up and go but he still kind of ends up coming off like a shy Michael Jackson impersonator I don't know if that appeals to you but it's not necessarily for me I could see what he's going for but it's just not really moving me so there are songs on here like fully realized songs that do feel a little underwhelming but there are tracks that feel to me even more forgettable that don't really have all that much structure to them at all overall on this LP the songs are longer you're not really getting those tracks that dip underneath two minutes like you would have on love remains you know those tracks that would kind of sound like a motif or an idea but they wouldn't last too long so they sounded fine they sounded great kind of swimming around in the murk of the other tracks but this time around you still get motif tracks but they last three minutes four minutes and they tend to kind of get mundane like on the track say my name or whatever where Tom Krell is kind of vocalizing over these sparkling loops that just continue throughout the entire track and it gets kind of old fast just because of a lack of progression same with the track running back which I think has a great intro a nice smooth bass line some fluttering guitars too but some of the loops just get there just a lot of tracks on here that I felt could have used more progression more climaxes to stay engaging if Tom Krell was going to repeat himself ad nauseam like this I mean the music and his voice would have to be a bit more stunningly beautiful maybe it's that way for you but but maybe not on the same level for me you know if more tracks on here just swelled like the string kiss song talking to you or the Xplosive closer we would have a very impressive album here I think I wasn't in love with it I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing but he's definitely going for something beautiful something pretty something moving maybe it will be that way for you more than it is for me if you check it out and give it a listen because I still at the end of the day admire Tom Krell is going for I like that he really kind of came forward with a nice variety among these tracks what did you think of this LP if you've heard it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and and that's it Tom Krell how to dress well total loss forever 
eR0cWuLWhzo,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's review time David Byrne and saint vincent love this giant this is a collaborative album collaborate collaborate on music collaborate collaborate music a collaborative LP from David Byrne and saint vincent great musical artists each of them in their own right you could say two of modern music's most eccentric characters this is assistant I mean they're both out there but I wouldn't necessarily say they're both cut from the same stylistic cloth you know once their creative juices mixed what would the end result be that was ultimately my question would it be some kind of strange Talking Heads bush of ghosts everything that happens strange mercy actor Frankenstein monster of sounds but David and Annie completely sidestepped all of that stuff now a letter about this album released and written by David Byrne along with the first track to drop from this LP who revealed that the challenge that David and Annie were facing on on this LP was horns an entire album of songs heavily dependent on arranged horn sections and the first track to drop from this thing who kept excitement and expectations high the track had kind of a herky-jerky groove to it something I would expect David to kind of bring to the table farty colorful and and zany horns playing some pretty complex arrangements you've got David Byrne and Annie Clark singing together trading off vocals spots it was kind of a dream collaboration but I can't help but feel like this thing was ever so slightly a little bit like a little baby letdown but not because of a lack of effort I actually feel like Byrne and Clark kind of pushed one another's ambitions a little further usual especially when it comes down to the focus of this album the horns they really labored over these horns on every track and there is no 1 track you know singling out saying oh this is very you know a nice densely layered horn piece that that's very busy I mean every track is like that some arrangements are crazier have a little more attitude than others like the track weakened and the dust which has Annie Clark singing lead on on that track and I imagine with the horns on that song I just kind of see her doing this weird dance with her eyes crossed and just making these weird crazy faces I don't know why I imagined that but I really get that personality from the horns it's a track that really kind of throws inhibitions out the window but on the other side of the spectrum there are a lot of arrangements on here that are very beautiful very tender kind of touching especially the introductions to the tracks dinner for two and an ice age and the entirety of the closing track outside of space and time which kind of almost has like a musical theater quality to it or like a Disney soundtrack as you first listen to this LP like it happened to me you're most likely going to just have your attention grabbed by the horns you're not going to hear anything else you're not gonna hear the songwriting a lot of which is great and just kind of be distracted by how flashy and and kind of gaudy these horns can be it's rare to listen to an LP with just so many horns on it from front to back kind of get acclimated to that let them settle in and try to get a view of the overall picture of this album because when I did I realized that you know what even though some of these songs are structured the same they do have those horns that are prevalent on every track there is a lot of topical variety on this LP volume variety emotional variety where my disappointment my huge disappointment that literally ruins some songs on this album for me my big disappointment where it comes in is in the other instrumentation mostly the drum machines on this thing hearing drum machines paired with really lush gargantuan horns sections is is not really a combo I like especially considering a lot of the rhythms on this thing do tend to fall flat and and suck the viscera right out of a lot of these tracks weekend in the dust dinner for two Lazarus an ice age to I'm either just not digging the beats they get too repetitive or the Timbers on them are just really really bad and and out of place the only beats on this entire LP that I do like are the ones that are maybe a little bit more spacious are using some more realistic drum Tambor so they sound somewhat real or the drum beats that are manipulated to the point where you are getting some kind of interesting sounds out of them like on I should watch TV and I am an ape now like I mentioned earlier there are a lot of great songs on here st. Vincent is is pretty freakin awesome on the track optimist similarly captivating vocals from her there I feel like Dave hits upon an interesting song concept with the song I am an ape and and no where is he at his Burnie as' than the track I should watch TV where he's kind of singing about using the TV to get to know about his society and and blend in and become a normal person and then sort of just you know fit into society but maybe learning that that's not really what he wants or kind of the pains that that come with that so David Byrne and Annie Clark did put effort into the horn arrangements into their songwriting and into the lyrics as well you'll notice little quirky interesting things about not only what they're saying but how they're rhyming and how they're saying these things too overall I did like this album I liked the tunes I liked the horns it's pretty easy because the drums are buried in the back to kind of get lost in those and and just enjoy them after the initial shock of being like oh maybe this is just way too over-the-top David Byrne and an Annie Clark I could really see them as being enablers of one another in a way because of how strange they tend to be musically like oh hey you want to do that crazy thing let's do this and make it five times crazier as a result they really went out on a limb and I'm actually happy with that even if there are a group of beats a group of tracks on here that did not appease me if something flashy catchy and harmoniously and melodically complex seems like something you want to dive into then by all means even if you have no experience with David Byrne or Annie Clark I mean just try it out I would even kind of maybe recommend this to of Montreal fans yeah I could see that working so if you've given a listen to this LP what you think of it did you like it hate it why what should I review next oh yeah strong six to a late 7 and yeah yeah David Byrne Annie Clark love this giant [Music] 
0Kb4w7dGSN0,oh hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for an album review dinosaur jr. I bet on Skye these guys were massachusetts band first time i'm reviewing a record of theirs and these guys really helped to define a lot of the more underground sounds of rock in the late 80s and early 90s a lot of them actually kind of bubbling up to international popularity thanks to bands they inspired and they've done this with their early debut stuff the album you're livin all over me bug green mind the band is has a really solid alternative rock indie rock grunge and a noise rock sound and while it is easy to kind of toss these labels on to dinosaur jr. they do have a personality that that is all their own with their amps turned up to 11 and their guitars fed through some pretty hefty distortion pedals they deliver just really rich harmonious chords backed up with some really melodic guitar solos and leads coming from frontman and singer-songwriter J Mascis who writes these songs that are occasionally sappy and and sings them with these really kind of wimpy shy vocals with a voice that is kind of deep but also a bit nasally and slightly whiny as well a quality that I think has has grown ever stronger in J Mascis 'as old age now with the band's hard-hitting riffs and just pounding drums and and and just high threshold distortion combined with the melody combined with the great hooks combined with the J's J Chief J's kind of soft voice you can get something very loud kind of abrasive but the edge is is taken off by how amazingly captivating Dinosaur Jr songs can be now in the band's current phase of their career they're kind of in the midst of a reunion after a series of lineup changes in late 90s J Mascis kind of ended up being the band's only original member and they disbanded in 97 but dinosaur reunited in 2005 with the original lineup and it's kind of become one of the more successful Rock reunions of the 2000s the band returned to putting out studio albums without a hitch in 2007 with the LP beyond and in 2009 the band put out farm which was easily one of the loudest records in their discography some pretty hard riffs on that LP as well as some just blaringly loud guitars the drums just kind of snap just crack like a gun going off which did kind of have its pros and it's cons for me you know it's it's no secret that on this channel I do love some loud abrasive and heavy stuff but I have always been more partial to dinosaur juniors more melodic more ballad oriented side that's where I really think the magic of a dinosaur junior comes out because genre and style aside J Mascis is a master of memorable hooks and and moving melodies and that's what kind of keeps following dinosaur jr. so fun even though the band is essentially working with what's kind of a dated sound at this point now overall between the 10 tracks on this LP Dinosaur Jr does present a few new ideas but for the most part they're doing what they usually do as well as they've ever done it the track you don't pretend to know actually bring some strings and and some piano into the equation and even though you know you would assume that with the way Dinosaur Jr plays guitar especially you know when they're strumming their chords and everything like that it may end up kind of messy maybe a little underwhelming and overly chaotic it really works the track backs the strings up with some really tight rhythm guitar that I love it's got a really nice hyped up energy to the instrumentation but J Mascis his vocals are like in a completely different gear and they're doubled up and turned up a little bit in the mix to kind of lovingly cradle the the fast rock instrumentation that they're singing over you know it's something that really kind of chills me out even though the instrumentation is going fast I just feel like J just has such a calming voice that I love hearing on on record to record to record from these guys the track watch the corners right after the intro though I love even more the track has this badass introductory riff that when it eventually goes into the the verse chords of the song I'm just loving that rich distorted guitar tone as it kind of bounces back and forth between those chords and a really kind of sweet blaring guitar interval in addition to those two introductory tracks there are a lot of good rockers on this LP like the track I knew it oh so well which kind of has a cheesy introductory riff but I love the chord progression on the hook and the end of the song is finished off with a guitar solo that is just epic and and seconded only by the really anthemic closing track the track pierced the morning rain is just a barnburner but not every J track was was complete leaders love for me the track almost fare was kind of an acoustic pit stop on the LP but the groove on the track is just so kind of rigid and underwhelming and I thought the pacing on the track what was that was kind of underwhelming as well of course bassist Lou Barlow who's also known for his work and in the full completion and and Cepheid owe his contributions to the album aren't bad definitely not my favorites I do prefer Jay over Lou in terms of vocal delivery but what Lou does bring to this album is is definitely some much-needed variety the first contribution of his route is is kind of a country tinged rocker and later recognition on the album really stands out because of its staccato riffs that that open the track up this is not a bad album I mean great closer and I think the first two songs on this thing are two of the better rock songs of this year period but overall as an album and just as a band I don't feel like dinosaur jr. really went above and beyond in any way you know it's comfortable it's consistent which is something to be admired for sure even though there were several tracks on this thing that I did find to be slightly forgettable I'm feeling strong seven to a light eight on this LP what did you think of this album did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next Anthony Fantana dinosaur jr. forever 
CIqPtFREokI,it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion this week taking on the new little be single California boy Lil B rapper Entertainer basedgod and prolific purveyor of the most controversial mixtapes on the internet ever 2012 has proven to be an exceptionally fruitful year for the bass god this year little B has extended his flame series with the white flame and green flame mixtape he's also challenged the legacy of rap icon Jay Z with the release of the bass print 2 he also released his first classical album he was also trapped in bass world and once he escaped he released an 848 song mixtape which I did not listen to but the bass God's crowning achievement of this year thus far easily hands-down was God's father a mixtape with over 30 songs on it featuring some of his most lavish production yet as well as compelling Rhymes I mean God's father is the bass God's potential fully realized but this new track from little B from what is going to be his upcoming rock album reaches for a potential of a different kind little B is the base gun and the bass God is little B but because of that it's sometimes easy to forget that little B is also Brandon McCartney Brandon McCartney is a humble young man very sincere somewhat shy as well in short a good-natured California boy and that's what this song is about not the real side of little B but the really really real side of little B I know in the title of this track it says little B is the performer little B is the creator the conceived ER but little B hmm not really the artist on this song this track is purely branded little B is merely transmitting this song to us now this track kicks off with some arpeggiated guitar chords and once the bass and the drums and the vocals enter the equation the song turns into a celebration of everything that was grand and fantastic about 90s pop rock as well as grunge with a mix of acoustic and electric guitar very melodic leads this track capitalizes on everything that bands like Dinosaur Jr stood for it really loves to lay it on with the hook its segues nicely in between verses and choruses but easily the most interesting thing about this track are the lyrics now on the surface little B has delivered what essentially seems to be a love song but the lyricism on this track once interpreted properly exposes this thing to be something much deeper take notice - how he says these words little B is stuttering when saying these things obviously showing some level of nervousness but he tries to assure this person saying that when I look into your light blue eyes I think about you and I I am focused I'm thinking of us when I'm looking at you I'm not thinking of other things I'm not thinking of other places I'm not thinking of other people and yet later in the track this person will not talk to little B when she sees him at the beach but you know he's the bass God even though he looks weird it's ok but he reminds this person that love is in your heart and if you knew that you would you would know it is there you would find it there and once you find that love in your heart you can take it and project it onto the bass God and and love him and you will find this love outside not inside on the internet where people are saying very nasty things about little B every day you have to go outside if you're going to find this love get up from the chair step out the front door little B will be there waiting with open arms go outside right now he'll he'll be there just go go outside though B we'll be outside go why are you here now that'll be over all appears to be up to the challenge of getting this love from this person but he also kind of acknowledges hey you know I'm just a California boy he's not Miley Cyrus he's not Obama he's not even Ellen DeGeneres on this track he is the embodiment of a California boy I enjoyed this track quite a bit it's quite infectious I would say it's incredibly based and and that's really all I have to say about it what did you guys think of it if you've listened to this track did you love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next remember the good comment the great rate the only the strong subscribe Anthony Fantana little B California boy forever 
HcE__4Fv5Hk,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review grizzly bear shields counter chesta [Music] I'm an grizzly bear is a New York band consisting of Chris Taylor Christopher bear daniel rossen and Edie drost and it's kind of weird for me to think it's been like six years since I first heard of these guys thanks to the release of one of my favorite indie psychedelic folk records ever yellow house it's an album that is very pleasant and gentle on the ears but is extremely bold in its vastness and very complex baroque instrumentation there are plenty of experimental and progressive song structures all over this LP too and it's also important to note that this LP kind of comes with the addition of two members beforehand grizzly bear was pretty much Edie and Christopher bear on drums but together Edie and Daniel made a really fantastic songwriting team on this LP just one great tune after another with lullaby and central remote knife and little brother which there is an amazing electric version of on the friend EP in between yellow house and the friend EP what those you know albums or releases were kind of forecasting I thought grizzly bear would definitely be a favorite band of mine for years and years to come but then they put out their next full-length album the Cata nest and while that LP did bring them a lot more fans gained a lot more attention for them it wasn't really a love at first listen for me there's some really strong singles on this LP for sure some of the catchiest songs of 2009 like the bright piano chord smashing track two weeks even though it was catchy er even though it was a bit more straightforward and that I'm sure you know made it appeal to a lot of people I for one was was missing the kind of excessive instrumentation you know the the heavy interludes the massive crescendos you know there were still some subtle and and refined tracks on there like Dori and and I do like the album for me it just really kind of felt like a step in a direction that that I wouldn't really care for if I felt grizzly-bear went into that direction any further now we have grizzly bears latest LP their fourth full-length LP shields and the T is toward the release of this album by first releasing the track sleeping ute which was pretty quiet for a single and brought back that kind of multi phase progressive songwriting that I loved hearing grizzly bear partake in for me a kind of signal a return back in that direction and I did kind of get that on this album but only to an extent and I'm going to be completely straightforward with this I feel like personally I got that only to the extent that the end product that we have here with shields is is kind of a middle-of-the-road record for grizzly bear to kind of measure things up to economists a little bit there's not a single track on here that is as joyfully infectious as any number of tracks on that album especially two weeks so while things are not really that poppy or catchy on this album except for a few moments maybe yet again being an example of that but still not really kind of a climactic pop enos or just an explosive popping us on that track maybe more of a subtle pop enos to continue the band has also not tried to approach the same level of lavishness and and detailed orchestration that i know they're capable of thanks to the choir version of an alligator off that friend EP I mentioned I just kind of feel like overall on this record I'm getting less finesse less detail and less volume as well the strongest tracks on this LP in my opinion are the ones that were released beforehand sleeping you is a great tune like I said goes back to that more progressive structure grizzly bear kind of brings a surprise into the mix with these psychedelic arpeggiating synthesizers and a really strong explosive hook and the track yet again has a really nice groove too I love the very huge gargantuan just grandly strum guitar chords but just kind of cascading all over the mix and the ending is is something kind of different or interesting for grizzly bear I mean it's just a really loud noisy chaotic freak out the rest of the songs on here for the most part I feel like they're likable but are also kind of mild like the track the hunt a quiet song kind of subtle song there is instrumentation kind of hanging in the background on the track and the hook is very painful cuts like a knife but the verse melody coming from the vocals is just dull dull dull and a simple answer has got to be my least favorite track on this LP it's just loaded with these very ham fisted piano chords thumping throughout the track that just have no grace to them whatsoever it's kind of like if you could imagine a morbidly obese ballerina stumbling out of stage in front of an audience of thousands also this track is one of the longest on on the album and and one of the most needlessly repetitive songs that grizzly bear has ever written the track gun-shy also lacks an interesting approach it's it's just way too straightforward way to surface but at least that song is definitely more sweet on the ears and I could see that growing on me for sure right after that the song half gate kind of brings those strings that I wish came in on gun-shy but they're just applied so lazily on this track the strings are just piled onto this track like dirt from the grave that these guys are digging for their old sound apparently the closer Sun in your eyes is the only other track on this LP that I really kind of felt love for it's a very climactic finish and it's multi-phase very progressive just like the song that kind of kicked things off I kind of loved how you had that moment of quiet as the song comes to an end the pianos there and then the ending kind of builds up into this very synthesizer heavy crescendo the vocal harmonies are wonderful and even though that moment of enjoyment is there as I finished the album I still kind of leave this thing being a little underwhelmed I will say for the most part the songwriting is there and for sure the recording quality is is there everything sounds good but there's just not that level of ambition and detail and an instrumentation that I have come to expect and enjoy from grizzly-bear I still did like this I liked a majority of tracks on this but I think this is easily grizzly bears spa deist release so far but what do you guys think of it let me know kind of feeling a decent two strong six on this thing what did you guys think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why what should i review next and anthony Fantana grizzly bear only the strong subscribe forever [Music] you 
qni6vhBYrBc,my needle drops Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review woods bend beyond these guys are a New York full crock outfit with some very freaky experimental and psychedelic tendencies taking cues from artists like Neil Young and crosby Stills and Nash as well as the Grateful Dead but also kind of going in their own direction as well and if I'm not incorrect this is their seventh full-length LP the follow-up to last year's Sun and shade which is the first woods LP since I had been following the band that was kind of a just disappointed with still despite that I love the band's style I love their sound breezily strummed acoustic guitars performing very dreary chord progressions a little bit of reverb for added effect some psychedelic sounds and then guitars and some very eerie falsetto vocals singing the lyrics with some great melodies and a lot of strong moods on their tracks it's it's kind of hard not to fall for woods at least a little bit if you're already a fan of the genres that they toy with because even though their songs do have a tendency to be a little low fie they are quite charming no wonder their popularity just kind of skyrocketed with the LP songs of shame which to me had some of their most painfully sad songs on there like rain on and the number woods definitely groomed things up a little bit with their next LP at Echo Lake where they were playing songs that to me were more succinct than they were sloppy they were fleshing their songs out with more instrumentation hooks were exploding and even catchy the plane was spruced up a bit as well and to me it kind of proved that Woods could definitely pen a series of songs that are catchy beyond their you know aesthetic beyond their beyond their style because for me this thing does have a nice set of on the fringe folk rock tunes now the band's next LP and then keep in mind Woods latest four albums have all been released within about a year of each other however I couldn't help but feel like on this LP maybe the well was running dry a little bit a lot of melodies on tracks for reminding me of of melodies I had heard on tracks from the previous three albums and I think been beyond is actually trying to break up that monotony a bit but not with a gigantic style change or anything like that more an attitude adjustment on the twelve tracks with this LP you still get woods falsetto vocals their ragged guitars low five veneer and just combination of a funk and psychedelic music but overall the band presents a brighter warmer and kind of friendlier sound even on the more quiet and acoustic tracks like something surreal and it ain't easy there's a very inviting quality to the music going back to the album at Echo Lake I feel like with been beyond woods are again writing songs that are more instrumental II realized more groomed with pretty much every song feeling very strange sweet and rootsy the opening track on this thing the title track is is very dramatic and and whimsical opener I love the guitar melody on this thing it's really kind of got me waving my head like this yeah like that it's something that I would kind of expect from woods which makes the the warmer tracks right after even more of a surprise but I think the only downside to the track is the end of it where the band just kind of throws out one guitar solo after another that aren't even really that good and it's kind of disappointing because I've heard better guitar playing on other wood songs I actually think a lot of the jam ear moments on this LP are kind of weak and underwhelming especially on the fifth track on here cascade and surprisingly this album doesn't really have any kind of one or two longer more psychedelic improvised tracks which which usually do turn up on a woods release still right after the opener comes the very awesome track calli in a cup it's got this really cute tree groove to it and a nice reverb harmonica to open things up and lyrics about leaves and snow and how seasons overflow it's a really endearing track I mean it feels like a cup of tea and a sweater and balmy weather in the middle of an acid trip is it honest is is another cup of tea to me but one of a different flavor it's it's kind of crisp crisp like stepping on dead leaves toward the end of October it's a straightforward tune the Seas woods using some string sections surprisingly that just adds to the warmth of this LP the track wind was the wine shows them working with a chord progression I'm I'm yet to hear them toy with and it's got kind of a vintage feel for me definitely something from the 60s and though it is the shortest track on this album to me it's one of the most emotionally powerful and to mention one more track sized meets the sound really one of the best songs woods has ever written in my opinion and an extremely captivating theme melody opening guitar lead wailing on that track and this track also contains one of the only Jam style moments that I actually think go over really well II and this track just meets this very intense just crashing Lee laughs climax overall with this LP woods just pulls together another solid set of tunes the only real major letdown with this LP is that there's nothing excitingly new on this album for longtime fans you know there's no huge exciting surprise there are a few tracks that do kind of feel like you know oh I'm seeing woods at a slightly different angle for sure and there is that mood change I talked about but still woods continues to be one of those bands that lets new or different ideas leak into their repertoire little by little it's something they have to be conscious of because they do it so methodically I am feeling a decent too strong seven on this LP what did you think of it as you loved it did you hate it why and what should I review next you'll be Fantino woods forever 
fg_z_80Frfw,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the new debut self-titled on the throw pika LP these guys are a Colombian band sort of a lot of transplants and people from all around the world in this band actually and they're kind of a cumbia supergroup that came together under some very rare and interesting circumstances being able to have access to one of the biggest and and most legendary Columbia recording studios of all time discos Flint days it's an analog recording studio and you get a really kind of crisp old-school sound out of just the tape that they lay these songs on there are dozens of musicians on this thing actually over 40 and to kind of guide all of them are two producers and together they all kind of have the passionate goal of trying to update and diversify this classic style of Latin music by experimenting with new sounds and styles now I wouldn't say at this point these guys are resurrecting cumbia or anything like that it's not like cumbia just up and died one day a lot like other forms of popular and roots music it kind of got incorporated into other flavors of the day you know there's cumbia rock out there there's techno cumbia there are sounds and instruments from cumbia being incorporated into music in Latin America that showcases sounds from dancehall as well as hip-hop so it's not like on the throat because like the last cumbia groups standing or anything like that or the only one who has ever experimented or taken the sound into some of the directions that they are on this album still there's something just really really unique and and jaw-dropping and special about the characteristics of this album the analog recording studio the really great musicianship and writing and a rain the mix of old-school seasoned vets who brought cumbia into the sound that it is today and new musicians who may have a passion for cumbia play cumbia themselves but also experiment with the genres that this album kind of finds itself weaving in and out of on this LP that kind of unpredictable mixed bag of musical styles that own the throw pica takes on here and the really bright attitude that this album brings I mean it just makes a phenomenal album that bright attitude to me as this album's greatest asset to me that attitude is is something that transcends musical style and culture no matter where you're from you can sense that there's just this really just just bright upbeat just smile inducing aura around this music simply put it's a fun album no-brainer now cumbia in short is is just it's very tropical music it's festive throughout these tracks you're gonna hear hand drums congas of different shapes and sizes upright bass piano accordion as well and horns horns horns the percussion section in these tracks just piles on polyrhythm after polyrhythm with with drum kits cowbell we a there are other traditional instruments on here too like the Meo which is a little wooden flute type instrument and for kind of added effect on these tracks guitar shows up as well synthesizers clarinet bagpipes marimba and there's even a song on here that features an 82 year old man rapping for the first time in his life though these guys are great musicians they write some seriously great songs and and perform them really well they do get kind of weird with their studio times sometimes and just let kind of whatever whim hits them just take them there is a really strong Latin music tradition on this album every musician on this thing just celebrates cumbia with with so much passion but what really makes this album so fun to listen to and just so new and invigorating is the sense of adventure the fact that producers will Holland and Mario galino sort of made sure to direct every track into a different area sort of have a different recipe to it and the fact that you have so many musicians involved has just made this album so versatile it's really a feat of patience and focus that will and Mario were able to guide this album away from the chaotic mess that it could have been and do it for the almost two hours of material this album has if you incorporate the bonus tracks this album opens up at the track tiene sabor tienes a zone the track has a really strong vintage Latin music flavor it to me is is maybe the more classic and and less messed with song on the map with this album and I love the horns on this track that kick in right toward the beginning and the chorus melody on this thing is killer it's a long one too I love a long develop melody but the lead singer on the track is great too and I don't know why like when I was first listening to this song when I first popped this album and not really knowing what to expect I just like yeah I was like it's not even like a sad song it was just it was weird it's just a really great track and what sounds even more fantastic about the song is that these guys are totally just playing these tracks performing them with minimal overdubs in the studio you really get the sense that you you know you're hearing them play together you don't get that a lot these days especially with bands this size where you can kind of punch in everything afterwards and whatever it creates an atmosphere where it sounds like they're having a lot of fun playing and it's hard to you know not have fun listening it just really makes me want to get up and dance my gringo ass off now the next track on here which was one of the first singles to drop from this LP put it on my love list punk arrows Sony Darrow is an accordion filled groove with a lot of spice and it kind of throws a curve ball into the equation by laying on some psychedelic guitar that you would think wouldn't work but actually sounds great there's some strange soloing on the track too there's a lot of great tracks that just like I say have that sense of adventure just kind of throw that curveball and just sound kind of refreshing like the tracks cough Lente's that sees these guys taking their Latin music instrumentation and chord progressions and applying them in a Scott context I mean you get the upbeat in there as well and we'll and Mario actually adds some dub effects into the song too as the horn melody on the hook kind of you know starts melting and just then it's a great part of the song it's it's cool stuff the Trank Libya sees the band incorporating a Middle Eastern melody into a song the Trank guy eat that throw pika not only sees them incorporating that instrument but also some really experimental weird psychedelic synthesizers as well dose lute recetas has the band playing with some very watery electric piano it's very mournful track the closing track on here actually features the band playing with with more of a swing style of jazz music and there's a song in here that's kind of like got an ambient drone in the background from a from an accordion and then somebody's beatboxing it's it's kind of weird and the song suena actually kind of features a an accordion horns a hip-hop beat and a female MC who is is actually really good I mean you know she's rapping in Spanish but still a lot of charisma it may be kind of gimmicky to jump from genre to genre on almost every track especially when on the third track here you have a Black Sabbath cover where you kind of have them really hamming it up with some kind of goofy vocals but on the throat we got really backs it up with some great freaking musicianship songwriting and and production because after I gave this thing a handful of listens and the gimmick kind of wore off what kept me coming back after that is the fact that the the songs were good the songs were well played I think this release is going to hook in a lot of people who are fans of Latin music people who have been listening to Latin music for a long time and who are maybe a little nostalgic for a time when a lot of the older musicians on this album were in kind of having their hay days but this is by no means a dusty old cumbia record you know it's a new album it feels like a new album it feels fresh and that's why I think it could appeal to a younger crowd as well and an American crowd too because I'm sure some people are gonna come across this and just you know get grabbed by the novelty of vintage Latin music if it's not really something that you listen to on a regular basis however if you know good playing and you know you know good production when you hear it like I said that's what's gonna keep you coming back and maybe even turn you into a serious Latin music fan so you know if this is outside of your comfort zone in my opinion that's all the more reason to try it and that's it I mean as far as negatives on this album go for me the Black Sabbath cover does border on just being ridiculous the rap Maya track is is kind of weird as well but still fun still funny the track rap Maya is is also kind of weird but still funny and the track done days suena el Bombo is really one of the least sharp tracks on this entire album for me the vocal melody is just all over the place and doesn't really have a clear direction making it just a little more dull than some of the songs on here I would have liked to have heard maybe some some more soloing on this album you know there is a strong improvisational element to some of these songs but you know I just would have loved to have heard maybe just some more fiery horn solos that really would have made this album even more mind-blowing for me than it already is I mean let's face it this album in my opinion is just mind-blowing as is right now I mean it's just yeah it's just right God I'm feeling a light too decent 9:00 on this thing what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it hate it why and what should I review next Andy Anthony Fantana on death row pika forever 
_gGv4ZYuTeA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here cow he's really working on his jazz chords it's time for a tired review which is where I review an album even though I'm tired and this particular one's gonna be a doozy because for some reason I came out with about two times more notes than I usually do with an average album review and in this review we're going to be talking about the new corrales LP years past matter crownless is a New York progressive metal outfit with a special ingredient added to their mixture black metal the American black metal scene has been under a bit of scrutiny over the past five to six years because of bands that take a more atmospheric approach maybe to stay a less standard approach when it comes to the black metal genre wolves in the throne room liturgy and and Crowell is's is also in that group and the backlash that a lot of these bands have seen is is really no surprise I mean black metal historically is is a very insular culture the American bands I just listed could be writing carbon copies of Darkthrone records and black metal purists would still be scoffing at them and yeah I'm sure partially has to do with the fact that these guys are changing the formula they're they're changing essentially what what the music means what the music is is about and sounds like but but also another thing that comes up is is image black metal is is a very image obsessed culture as image obsessed as the other musical cultures it perceives itself to be different than I'm sure and a bunch of dudes from New York City with backgrounds and avant and progressive and experimental metal projects isn't exactly the kind of appearance that originators and and longtime fans want attached to the tremolo guitar xand the retched vocals and in the blast beats that at one time represented something that was very occult very murderous something that really kind of reveled in its obscurity a style of music that carries this much baggage is not going to be integrated into the grand scheme of things easily and you see that in in the hipster tag that gets thrown on a lot of these American black metal groups I mean just sort of throw this image on them that is supposed to be very far removed from the Nordic musicians that kind of brought this style into the beloved sound it is today and I will agree with that tag to an extent you know at first when when these American black metal bands started rising up being blogged about it became kind of a trendy thing you know black metal from America even though it's not entirely a brand new thing to a lot of people it was and I think it's easy to assume five years later a lot of the novelty has worn off at this point I like to think anybody who's still following us made black metal is is listening to it because they're authentically interested in the sound and I would like to think that's especially true in the case of crannis they have just released one dense long challenging album after another not really the kind of music that is rewarding with cursory listening that that people may be giving to more atmospheric and repetitive black metal albums Krause's tracks are just an onslaught of blast beats technically proficient walls of guitar dishing out layers of tremolo picked leads bass lines chords and together they create some of the most interesting dissonant beautiful and and moving harmonies and and and melodies in in metal music today now when it comes to the composition of their tracks Crowl Ascona tends to jump from one riff or melody or passage to one another at a speed that that makes all of it kind of difficult to process on the first listen on the second listen on the third listen the 10-minute epics that these guys write are are very impressive and the musicality and the composition is really where the variation that this band brings the creativity that this band brings is at because over the course of all their LPS they have remained very consistent stylistically I mean to the point where if you didn't like their first album or their second album you're pretty much tuning out at this point or maybe even if you enjoyed the earlier work kind of getting tired of the fact that they're really kind of just sticking to their guns and and just really kind of putting out the same style and you know I will admit I will say Cronus's style is is not for everyone it will wear you down even if you're interested in hearing it I do think they show some progress and maybe a little bit more variation than usual on this new LP but I still think enjoying this album as a whole enjoying the sound loving this album really really hinders on your ability to just digest what they're doing musically like I said crownless is really a combination of progressive rock and black metal with with more of the former than the latter and maybe they're not put together in in a way that is the best pairing of them or maybe not the best pairing of them but the kind of pairing of them that is going to necessarily attract listeners for one there's just a lot of technical precision - what Krause does and the way they write their tracks it's just like an endless segue one phase after another trying to repeat as little as possible and they dress their compositions in these tremolo Pickett ARS in the blast beats and vocals that are both deep loud kind of Brody and coming from down here but also retched or just like these tortured screams I know Mick Barre kind of handles the higher registers of the vocals on on Krauss's LPS the beats from the drums have a lot of ambience on them as if all the drums are at a distance the vocals sound like they're recorded even further away from the microphone and the guitars are up front really kind of bleeding into one another I do think this is really Crowley's best recorded album yet I do think there were some moments on their last LP do tema that were a little muddy we're a little bit more lo-fi I think Crowley's kind of teeters between being hi-fi and lo-fi Krause's instruments ring through really clear especially with the bass I mean you are hearing a lot of bass on this record especially on on one track I was catching bass arpeggios or you'll really kind of catch the bass playing a variation or some counterpoint to whatever the guitars are doing I mean some nice bass on this thing but still crownless the way they record their albums it's it's still a huge reference to those older black metal records how things are positioned in the mix I personally feel like there's a lot of sincerity in what Krauss does with black metal I feel like they love black metal they love these older black metal records and they're just kind of taking the avant-garde and experimental approaches that that dudes like Mick bar and Colin Marcin in this band have taken with their other projects and just applying it to the genre the thing is this very rough and harsh and abrasive black metal sound this black metal style isn't exactly the easiest thing to digest when you pair it with these really dense compositions that Kraus produces one kind of suffers at the hand of the other but maybe not in a way where they both feel terrible but but are just difficult I mean just difficult like solving a Rubik's Cube with your feet difficult and even though Corrales and years past matter art tough I mean they are tough they're not impossible it's it's not like you cannot commit these tracks to memory it's not like there aren't standout moments I loved the introduction of the first track on here it has a really nice atmosphere to it before it just kicks in with these blast beats and then it just kind of goes into zero gravity as the drums just kind of just disappear and the guitars lay on these layered harmonies and I'm also kind of catching some since in the mix on this thing which if I'm not mistaken is this kind of a new thing for Corrales there are some atmospheric spots on this album like the intro to the first track there is a bit of feedback some some drone a little bit on on the end of the second track there is very airy and ethereal ambience on the end of the third track - and the fourth track has kind of an easy in as well and the fifth track is a very noisy kind of dissonant ambient moment to last about two minutes lots of cymbals and guitar feedback on this thing I mean ambience is really kind of the the new addition to corrales repertoire and they're really incorporating it into their tracks pretty well mostly at the intros and outros I wish it kind of showed up in the middle of some songs a little bit more would have brought more dynamics to these tracks but but still it's a cool addition so you do kind of get these atmospheric or ambient intros and outros but the middles of these songs the Centers of them it's just immensely intense Hellfire there's even a spawn the second track where I'm catching these these really fast rising climaxes or the guitars are just strumming really fast at the very peak really kind of reminds me of what liturgy was doing on their last LP and and if that is inspired a little bit I wouldn't be surprised considering Colin Marcin did do production on that liturgy record but hey you know could be a two-way street with them I know both bands are very conscious of what the other is doing later in that second track those bass arpeggios that I mentioned are there and I just have a hell of a time going through this song and just kind of pulling apart and listening to these winding just unpredictable passages that that Crowley's has pulled together lots of nooks and crannies in in this track and and some moments that to me are is powerful and the melodic themes they break into on the 7-minute mark of this track I mean surprising change and and a great just section the especially intense and fast soloing in the middle of the third track and and the ambient outro are enough to make that song stick out to me track 4 has has a very slow introduction and and builds up escalates nicely there's a very dramatic ending on the song some syncopated starts and stops very thematic riffs and then the closer which is a 16-minute beast totally justifies its ending with maybe the most variation on any track here and a spot toward the end where man it gets so melodic it almost reminds me of like video game music on the NES bottom line crownless is a progressive metal band they are a progressive metal band period they just kind of use black metal as a veneer for their progressive style and this works for me personally I mean this works a lot for me because I feel like a lot of moderate progressive rock and progressive metal it's just too clean sounding too sanitary just too groomed to really be rock music to me rock instinctively has to have some kind of edge I mean maybe Krauss's edge is a little too sharp for some people but you know not for me now if there are some negatives to this album it just Krause's style to me in general I feel like they can be just maybe a little too dense a little too obtuse for somebody who's not exactly already into black metal but that kind of goes against what I said earlier because a lot of people who are longtime black metal fans aren't necessarily going to jump onto this with excitement because Crowley's does kind of bend a lot of rules I still think with some production that is slightly clearer maybe with the guitars bleeding into each other a bit less Cronus's music would be easier to digest and sometimes there are moments especially on track 3 where I feel like Krauss is just throwing so many guitar leads just so many solos just so many sounds into this wall of guitars that they're building that some magic some some musical ideas that they're fooling around with kind of get lost and while I do think this is one of crownless is more varied efforts yet I mean as long as they're incorporating these these ambient and just sort of jeroni elements to these cracks I mean I feel like they could always incorporate more variation I mean while I do think they are kind of very very good and incorporating very good at bringing compositional variation I mean a lot of musical ideas flying in at every direction on this thing I do feel like they could use more variation in the intensity department despite all those complaints I still think Kraus is a very impressive and great band that has something special with with what they're doing sure you know they haven't exactly been reinventing themselves with every album they have released they're one of those artists that instead of just kind of throwing the whole blueprint out and starting over again they're just fine-tuning tilting things this way just twisting knobs slightly though Crowley's does have a black metal element to their style I don't necessarily think this is just for black metal fans I mean you have to have an appreciation for progressive you know progressive structures and long winded tracks and in order to really like this because even though crownless does have a black metal sound it's gonna get old for you I mean you have to like the melodies you have to appreciate the playing that goes into this record to really like it if that's not your thing there are plenty of black metal records out there that are just kind of going for more of a mood I mean Krauss is not really just a mood album it's not really just mood music it is just straight in your face playing and intensity it is relentless it is compositional strength command and then creativity overall feeling strongly to a light 9 on this album I mean I haven't enjoyed Krauss this much since their debut album and I'm glad to be kind of in a position where I'm loving their music again if you've given this album a listen what did you think that did you love it hate it why why should I review next and yeah it's about it it's about it Anthony Fantana crouch forever 
aHhY1flRwVM,hi everyone Anthony Pantano here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the XX coexist being sex you always are my Neos xx the XX is a London quartet turned trio who made its full-length debut three short years ago that man that that album this album turned heads around the world these guys made out to a lot of year-end lists with this LP a lot of adoration across the Indies sphere as well as a Mercury Prize under their belts but admittedly I did not like this album really honestly outside of a few tracks I still don't and I will explain my reasons why in this review but first let me try to I guess sort of paint a picture of what makes the XX so appealing the XX pretty much writes very skeletal simple indie pop that that is quiet as the Dickens and the music also feature some pretty subtle R&B influences and some very crisp beats inspired by electronic music as well pretty much every X extract is fronted by these very breathy understated boy/girl vocals that deliver lyrics about lust and and longing desire and and love on the rocks and all of these ingredients kind of add up to an end product that is perceived to be very shy but also very sexy and sensual and understated but kind of emotive and passionate as well LLL but for me hearing what somebody is shooting for and actually feeling it it being a thing that is just so thick and and tangible in the music are two completely different things and that's where I'm coming from on the debut that's where I'm coming from with the XX in general as much as they try to drum all of these sexy lustful and and very shy emotions up I just don't really connect with any of them I do think these guys have style you know I will give them that they have great production to go along with that style as well but to me execution matters writing matters and I kind of feel like that's where the XX suffers to go back to the emotion I know people are pulling them primarily from the vocals on the xx's tracks and I think in this case people are really kind of construing being quiet and just being very you know whispery with with being passionate I could definitely see someone likening what the xxxx does to lover whispering in your ear but I can't help but feel like interpreting the xx's vocals as just an overall lack of emotion of authentic emotion because all the vocals on the self here delivered with the the same flat Moni faked orgasm like mumbles it's like a facade they just put on to perform these songs and you know I understand it's music it's entertainment everything is a facade to an extent but to me nothing the XX does suspends belief especially when I'm hearing miss Croft and as an image straining when they're singing either missing notes or just kind of weaving in and out of pitch usually I can see myself seeing past something like that if I feel like there's a really awesome attitude or just emotion behind a vocal but I'm just not getting that from the xx like I know a lot of people are transmission not being received another thing that kind of keeps this connection from happening is that I feel like the lyrics that the XX writes are so vague the lack of details in in a number of these tracks could make it so that just about anybody could apply their personal situation to the song and that to me kind of reads us as being generic as being shallow I mean what separates one thing from another thing are the details everything the XX says only adds up to a very roughly sketched emotion the only thing on this LP and their previous LP that I think the XX are great at are consistent with is creating some nice grooves creating a very subtle atmosphere very kind of serene very pleasant to the ears I like the idea that they had for the opener to just kind of pair the vocals with with just a guitar it really kind of to me had had a modernized Motown kind of feel to it I love the chord progression on the track missing that's really nice the song fiction to me has really one of the darkest beats I've ever heard the XX produce and I love how they kind of color it with this really long dark deep piano note the piano on the track swept away is really beautiful and delicate and the addition of strings on the track tides I mean they sound great - nice touch but to me these are just kind of motifs and moods because on a lot of these tracks the XX just kind of boughs out or just ends a song abruptly because it doesn't seem like they know how to really tie something together and create a finish especially on the track chains which to me is an example of another issue that I have with this album while the XX is great at creating an instrumental mood or groove whenever they try to make something stand out like the guitar solo toward the end of that track it just comes out really really bad however if you like this album if you really love this album adjust the XX in general I understand I mean what they're trying to do emotionally appeals to you it connects with you you know it does not with me I mean I'm sure that's going to make some fans happy that they kind of stuck to their guns but I really kind of feel like they said everything they had to say on that debut album until they drum up different idea coexist does work with a few different beats you know you kind of catch a future garage beat on here in a moment that that kind of sounds like it would be nice backing a burial track and these guys definitely do try to vary things up a little bit instrumentally and production wise but but still you know all those things I mentioned there's still things I don't like about this album so I'm kind of feeling strong for to a light five on this LP if you dig it you dig it if you don't you don't but whether or not you do or don't let me know did you love this did you hate this why and what should I review next anthony Fantana the XX forever [Music] you 
bcDvYDiTthk,it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Atoms for Peace default track reviews where we talked about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion because new Atoms for Peace track default oh my god electronic music side project from Tom yoke of the radio heads y'all and this new track also comes with an album announcement new LP on the way as well on XL Recordings the band the project has kind of been around for a while at least since 2009 when Tom u're kind of formed this this band to play his material from the eraser live and the band featured flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers Nigel Godrich who actually helped Tom York produce the eraser there are more members of the band as well up until this point it's mostly bent forward for a live capacity for Tom's material are they being involved in the writing process on this new track and this new forthcoming LP I don't know if they were certainly would make things interesting however on this brand new track default nothing really sounds like it was outside of Thom Yorke's abilities and and pretty much everything in the track itself sounds like you know him it's distinctly him I mean pretty much like his eraser project it's electronics beats Tom's voice let's get into the track I mean damn I really like it has the kind of detail I love hearing an electronic music production the kind of detail I wish showed up on more tracks on the King of Limbs I mean you know not to beat a dead horse but I do I wish that there are these emphasized hits all over the beat but it still delivers such a smooth groove amen I would even say the beat is cool the beat is jelly not like um num num num hot chili I mean like and this thing just has a mix of textures both rough and smooth especially coming from those keyboards which are just man those are just slick I mean lick them you could lick them and it would just feel like glass I love how there's just so much detail in the beat and yet it is so spacious there's just so much room for Thom Yorke's voice just crooning over it in in the nasally way that he usually does in the very ah you know hang it up there in that upper register and I'm loving the cavernous reverb on his voice and when the hook comes in those sense really just kind of hug everything but that's not the only thing the synthesizers do you know not just that smooth sound I mean they're squiggling sounds in here just like bubbling sounds as well there's this weird sound effect in the beat that I don't know whenever a certain part of the rhythm hit you kind of get this you know reversed and just forward just like this really weird rough drag in the percussion and the hook is a nice the beat does not change up too much unfortunately I think that really would have brought this track to the next level really would have brought a nice contrast to the song but Tom's voice the melody that he carries in that moment of the song it is just stark and and moving enough to to just kind of signify that change solid ending on this track to nice length I mean I'm really I'm really liking this track a lot not an overpowering sense of emotion that I usually love hearing from from Thom Yorke but but beautiful simple and and very subtle as well I'm really enjoying this song very enjoyable and it's kind of got me psyched for this forthcoming LP hmm I bet some of you guys listen to this album I mean song and you may or may not have an opinion on it did you love it hey why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantino Atoms for Peace forever 
rif2C3Xd5kM,[Music] it's track review [Music] good news hi everyone Anthony and tan Oh ear Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music and hip hop and metal as well the independent persuasion because I want to all the time and in this particular installment of track reviews we're going to be touching down on the new Death Grips track at Death Grips which is a new song titled after their Twitter handle which was chosen to end out the 2012 Adult Swim summer singles program every year Adult Swim on their website just drops a series of of single tracks throughout a couple months during the summer there's one a week and Death Grips just happen to be the one to finish things off like now you may know of Death Grips already they're an experimental hip hop trio from Sacramento their album slash mixtape that they dropped last year ex-military was my second favorite album of that year and the Money Store that I reviewed this year they're their second full-length LP or debut if you do consider ex-military to be a mixtape um yeah you know what that that was hell of an album I remember one time I showed my mom Death Grips and she was like is this heavy metal mom's a mom to me they're really kind of in a direction of their own they've got their own style but what's even more important is not only do they have style not only do they have their their own sound they also have execution good musicianship creativity very interesting beats and instrumentals and of course it is just fronted by lyrical demon MC ride now these guys have a new LP on the way titled no love deep web they have been kind of screwing with the 4chan board and you to kind of promote toward the album releasing a series of instrumentals from the Money Store and they kind of leaked the release date on the board through some some really strange cryptic messages no love deep web should be dropping in October but in the meantime we do have this new Death Grips song now a lot of these Adult Swim tracks do kind of tend to be b-sides and then throw aways and I wouldn't be surprised if that was also the case with this new Death Grips track however the group is so weird and just so unique you know that they're gonna make something they're going to bring something that is just needed to be heard by fans whether they like it or not they may put a new idea to something kind of mind-blowing in it that you haven't heard them do before and I have to say in my opinion when it comes to being out there this track at least met my expectations you get a really weird female vocal sample toward the beginning of the track and then another vocal sample that's just just a lot of stuttering sounds once the beat gets started it's it's kind of difficult to tell where it begins and where it ends just so much detail goes into this beat and pretty much every Death Grips be I mean more than most hip hop outfits out there their instrumentals really evolved across the entirety of the track there are just so many phases and just parts in the song I love how right toward the introduction of the song on on on on the beat just kind of changes atmospheres all of a sudden it just feels like it's been plunged under water it's just really really just submerged it just has a submerged feeling to it and also in the beat you kind of have this week it really kind of feels like something Lex Luger would have produced you know like waka flocka flame Lex Luger and LA as far as emcee ride goes definitely one of his more understated deliveries I mean even more understated in some parts to me then then get got the intro to the Money Store there are some spots where where emcee ride does bring the intensity up volume wise but as far as the point of the song is the direction of the lyrics I'm not I mean maybe we could debate this a little bit in the comment section or something but I mean I think topically he's a little all over the place which which kind of adds to his dementia that he seems to be suffering from whenever he's rapping from the standpoint of this very dark character he depicts in his songs he's rapping about kind of lusting after this woman but also kind of this weird situation with this car and then running someone over it didn't really hit me maybe it'll click with me a little bit later down the road or something but what I know may not grow on me in a while is definitely the hook on this thing the breakdown hook not really one of the best hooks I've heard death grips put together and they're usually like on their a-game when it comes to just a really catchy refrain overall I thought this track was was decent I dug it you know and that's all I got to say about that I mean what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next let me know Anthony Fantana death grips forever [Music] [Music] 
J0tsp_XeFd0,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd here to ask you a quick question something I haven't done in a little while um read a study recently conducted by Nielsen saying that half of Americans across this grande country of ours use the radio primarily to discover new music I realize a lot of you may have gripes with the radio you hear the same songs every 20 minutes you don't hear the songs you want to hear when you want to hear them you miss the songs you would like to hear sometimes they don't say the title of the songs that you just heard and you want to know what they are because you liked them plus the radio tends to be pretty limited when it comes to more adventurous or experimental styles of music unless of course we're we're talking about college or listener funded radio like I said half of all Americans I'm going to link you guys to the article where I read this but YouTube being used as a primary mode of discovering new music was also mentioned as an answer in the study among this the group of Americans surveyed and compared to the radios 48% YouTube just got a mere 7% tiny me however when you took this group of people and limited it they didn't it to just teenagers YouTube came in at 64% with the radio trailing still at around 50 iTunes came in as well and I will just sort of like lump all those together as just the Internet and basically what my question to you is is the radio always going to be a relevant tool when it comes to introducing the populace to new music because I'm sure a lot of you who are teenagers now are not just going to turn around and start using the radio as your primary mode to kind of expose yourself to new music as soon as you get older just because you're older what if twenty years from now only 20% of teenagers say that the radio is their primary way of discovering new music what will the music industry look like then will music be different at all due to radio having less of an influence on on what people's tastes are as things like mobile devices become more popular and then people have wider access to them of course people are going to opt for the service that gives them what they want when they want it even if what you want is something that normally gets played on the radio I mean if you're a Nicki Minaj fan and you want to hear a Nicki Minaj song if it's not being played currently in in commercial radios rotation of tracks maybe it's some song she put out two years ago or something like that you're going to have to hit the Internet so definitely a question I would love to hear answered by anybody who watches me who is a teenager for sure do you use the radio at all to discover new music and if you do you know use the radio as well as the Internet obviously you use the Internet if you're using both which do you prefer could you feasibly see people in the near future using radio less than they are now to discover new music obviously radio had its time served its purpose played a really important cultural role in American music history but is that era about to come to an end let me know what you think Anthony Fantana the radio forever [Music] [Music] 
6i8EVMkZvfs,BAM hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd once again with my girlfriend manning the camera going through god this is six this is number six the sixth edition of videos going through my vinyl collection alphabetical order we started here in the A's and Natalie now we're here so I mean we're almost almost halfway through so we could do this possibly and around 15 videos we're gonna see but we're just getting into the e section now just talked about all my Bob Dylan records weird is now breaking into the ease in this alphabet and first record that's gonna kick off my ease is not an amazing record 12-inch single of some electronic music from I don't know how to pronounce the name dear IDI Bisou Bisou but the important thing to note on this record not only is it if I remember correctly I think I've listened through it once it's it's an interesting piece of of house music but if you're looking for some some awesome electronic music I mean look up rns records I mean solid record label when it comes to house techno I mean that brand of electronic music and a lot of you may know that most recently as having put out a lot of James Blake's material okay next a record I am a bit more familiar with after clang cheese parade parades or parade its parades I love the cover art on this thing and absolutely in love with this cover art this band has actually saw them perform live in hand and once in Connecticut and it was quite a lovely show they came dressed up they I mean a lot of people call this post rock it could be classified as that but I think it's so much more orchestral and and so much less rock you know it's really kind of like for me a popular side of that style of music I mean it's it's really as colourful as the cover art suggests I mean this is a nice gatefold I believe it's just black vinyl but nice you know nice black sleeve though it is played at 45 rpm alright let's keep going we're moving we're moving here we go explosions in the sky all of a sudden I miss everyone I love this picture I actually bought this album because I was completely in love with the cover and actually did not listen to it for a little while I was just like hey man I'm just so into this cover I mean I just love the boat coming over this way this guy stuck stranded here the flood situation I just like the colors it's just an interesting picture to me and the artwork on on this thing is absolutely gorgeous you know you have all these different scenes I'm assuming memories that this person is reflecting on as they're stuck out here in the in the middle of the water and I believe yes over here on this picture is where you kind of see the boat that is referenced on the cover kind of coming to pick this person up and his head is down it sort of looks like in this picture the bird is as well as still in the cage and what's awesome Dominique I'm definitely gonna need you to try to get a shot on this is on the D side of the record there's actually an amazing edging of sort of a different version of the the front cover yeah there we go it's actually like that frame can you see that can you make that out at all yeah this way a little mark yeah there there like the the picture of the boat that you see picking this person up in that last picture this is kind of like that last frame where he's been picked up and the boat is gone and just the boat that he was in is just kind of left there and that's it I mean it's it's a great post-rock LP explosions in the sky all of a sudden I miss everyone I mean definitely not my favorite post rock band 4 for numerous reasons but um you know uh beautiful music to me on that record and you know it's just even work gorgeous artwork nothing too amazingly deep to say about this record but you know definitely something an artist to look up if you're looking for ambient music Brian Eno ambient 3 I mean obviously when it comes to his ambient side I mean the the world the the album to get is ambient one but you know ambient 3 if he can't get one get three I mean there are some interesting moments on this definitely not my favorite and be an album but you know some interesting moments alright continuing ooh the Falls debut LP lied at the witch trials I mean you know you're looking for a raw post-punk LP that's noisy and messy and just gonna blam it out then this is definitely worth looking up I mean you know if if you like the fall or if you're going to like the fall this is the LP to start with because I mean this is pretty much the blueprint of their style if this does not turn you on then you know I say maybe turn back I'm sure that would probably piss some people off I mean you know their albums and their discography more beloved than that one but you know if you could tell what their style is from the record you know which is just really rough and just really in your face and not really particularly planned out but more and jammed out you're here to figure out whether or not it's your cup of tea alright these next two I reviewed this record on the channel it's with a double LP of that Flaming Lips and Hedy friends you know puke green vinyl Mike Mike Mike my copy is puke green I have the tracklist printed out over here both vinyl copies and you know both records are well this one's more orange my other one is a green color but um you know it's a nice little double LP set you know gave it a listen sounds great I just sort of wish the two covers actually came folded together but they are separate in their own little kind of sleeves unfortunately but you know it's still COO favorite album of last year Fleet Foxes the helplessness blues well not the helplessness blues to help uh since blues I love this gatefold I just love the cover art on this thing it's so detailed love the lyrics being printed out in here right in the center classy stuff you know nice little simple black nothing too amazingly fantastic to say about the covers of them that is just a classy cover and I do like the the labeling that Sub Pop did over here on the on the inside of the record they did a nice job with that though it's not really like you know a Columbia record label it definitely has like that old-school kind of feel to it and I believe there is a poster here is a big giant poster kind of like you know pencil drawing version of what you see on the the front cover that comes along with this and I believe like kind of a thank yous yeah from the record that's nice pull up the thank yous make them real big everybody sees their name everyone likes being thanked alright if you're looking for some classic hardcore punk compilation disc court record style flex your head definitely not my favorite collection of punk songs but I mean this is pretty much like you know if you want to get a snapshot of the DC hardcore scene during its its heyday this is this is where you got to kind of go you know look up flex your head you will get an idea of what musically things were like that you know in that musical scene I mean you have teen idols on here on touchable state of alert minor threat government issue red sea void iron cross you know for the most part bands that that carry a legacy in that area Flying Lotus LA looking for some crazy interesting mind fudging beats I mean look of this album not totally in love with the printing of the art on this cover but I do think this is a stellar album like that picture of him there that looks nice you know a 1 2 B 4 it's a nice package it's a nice gatefold it's a nice couple of LPS I'm totally down with it happy have this on vinyl unfortunately at a cosmic gram on vinyl oh this one's more of an embarrassment not really foreigner best of collection got this from my aunt we've got jukebox hero on here hot-blooded not going to finish that all right ooh now we are getting into my Fugazi records aside from bub what looks like we're gonna get into them next time but I will say that I think besides Dylan Fugazi is in second place in terms of how many records I own or have owned from a single artist but we will go through my what five Fugazi vinyls right there we will go through those next time we went through the east now in the haps we're in there we're almost through the FS in this sixth installment of my vinyl collection thank you for watching thank you for commenting I'm glad you guys are are into this that's very flattering be back with more reviews soon and you're the best next vinyl thing coming soon love you vinyl forever [Music] 
RHEI2gRzfPU,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you reviewed and Egon America Dan Deacon is an electronic music producer singer and composer this is his latest LP the follow-up to which was his his breakout album really Brahms now a lot of you older needle drops not an age but in viewership may remember that I did not care for that album at all when it came out and and these days I still really don't like it I mean to me Brahms days is really the act of trying to show 30 pounds of into a ziplock just so many tracks on this LP are made up of skyscraper sized layers of fuzz Dow glitchy just very harsh and distorted abrasive electronics all arpeggiating very brightly all at once just not really an enjoyable listening experience for me plus I didn't really think the mixing was all too good on that album either me personally I prefer them much more raw and playful spider-man of the Rings America is loaded with really bright tones very sharpen and rough textures the kind of stuff that is just gonna get you standing up at attention really quickly many tracks on this thing are a sensory overload but not really a fulfilling one for me it's really kind of like throwing crushed Oreos and sour patch kids and Froot Loops into a cereal bowl and then just pouring four loko on top and then just digging in and you may be saying at this point Anthony I I agree with you to an extent on that description or maybe all the way but that's what makes Dan deacons music awesome and that's when I feel like our two opinions are gonna be at an impasse and even though I don't really like Dan deacons most recent stuff I do admire him for being a musician with his own sound a guy who consistently gives his fans what they want and makes the records that he wants to make but from my perspective there are a lot of songs that he makes these days that just do not have a lot of balance you get a lot of bright sounds a lot of loud sounds and they are just unrelenting to the point where it all just kind of ends up feeling like static to me after a while as I progress through a song even if the beginning may kind of catch my ear or sound pretty good to me however I will say in comparison to Brahms America is much more varied and features quite a few tracks that I like there are some tracks on the Selphy word and Deacon is actually composing songs with traditional orchestral instrumentation and it makes a lot of his compositions shine the students approach to composing music is is relatively minimal a lot of very simple repetitive progressions melodies arpeggios it's basic but also pretty beautiful when I run across a track on here like pretty boy where you actually do kind of get some some real live instrumentation but mixed with electronics that swirl and glisten don't glitch out and distort and the way the track just escalates it's really like some epic progressive synth Vangelis Chariots of Fire types it's synthetic moving and epic where Dan loses me is is on a track like crash Jam the electronics on this thing are fuzzed out as usual but to kind of add insult to injury for me on this track he throws all of the least interesting sounds into the foreground and buries all of the better sounds underneath than the vocals the drums the chords the first half of this LP was kind of hit or miss for me the second half is is like a completely different section of the album it is basically a group of tracks creating a suite that is titled after this album and I'll be damned if the first movement of this thing USA is a monster which maybe a statement or maybe a reference to the band of the same name either way to me this is really one of the best tracks I've ever heard dandy can make there is an awesome orchestral intro on the song that should stop anybody in their tracks who's listening to this thing all the way through the electronic glitches and and distortions that Dan usually works with eventually make their way into the track but they don't overstay their welcome and as the song continues they kind of get blended with that nice sounding orchestral instrumentation I like that combo overall the song does not feel as just obnoxious or annoying or as overbearing as some of his more electronic tracks can like the next song on this week the great American desert eventually the song ended up kind of sounding exactly like that just a desert a barren wasteland of just static that I'm not interested in hearing however the song rail right after is just completely orchestral instrumentation totally barren of electronics and it is lovely and it's just a great show of how Dan Deacon understands interplay and in counterpoint and when you can actually hear it on the closing track you have electronics mixed with a pretty epic gargantuan chorus but the electronics just kind of come to the forefront and drown the chorus out I mean why the electronics aren't even that interesting especially this point in the album when they are pretty much doling out the same exact sounds and Tambor's that you've been hearing for the entire album overall I got to say I'm torn on this album there was a handful of songs on here that I felt like wow I mean some of the best material I've ever heard Dan Deacon put out I love it when he's just working with normal orchestral instrumentation and maybe it would even sound great with him mixing it with the electronics if he had just more of a balance and not really one suffocating the other but as you guys know that's just my opinion I'm feeling a strong 5 on this LP if you guys give it a listen what did you think about it love it hate it why what should I review next and remember the good comment the great rate only the strong subscribe dan deacon America forever 
RNOWaELu2TM,I did that thing that thing I did hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's a busiest of music a nerd and it's time for a review Mount Erie Ocean War oh why are you so dreary can't you be cheery old Mount Airy yes this is the latest LP from singer/songwriter Phil elrom it's actually his second full-length album of this year the first album he released this year was clear moon reviewed it back in May I put a somewhat detailed description of Phil album's progression up until this point in that review if you're interested in such a thing feel free to watch that review via the description box in this video now before the release of clear moon I was really psyched for the release of what would be two albums from Mount URI this year I mean two full-length LPS in one year from one of my favorite artists ever I am down but when clear moon came out I just thought it was was slightly underwhelming still a good listener from a fan perspective definitely one of Phil's most serene albums definitely one of his more drone Laden albums - and it was kind of a stark contrast from the extremely black metal influence twins poem that had dropped previously I did like clear moon but I just kind of wished I had liked it more and I was kind of looking to this lp's sister album ocean roar to kind of come in maybe I don't know connect some things bring some things to light maybe have me make some kind of grand realization that whoa these are both awesome yes that could just kind of be something I'm projecting onto the album because I I wanted to do that but I do get the feeling from what I've heard about the LP in the fact that they're both being released in this year that they are connected in some way and if that is the case I mean I gotta say this album falls short very very short and you know I'm not even really sure it works as a standalone album either to me this album just kind of sounds like a very disjointed collection of b-sides and and afterthoughts from clear moon and and some black metal inspired tracks that wouldn't have really logically fit on that album I don't think and maybe we're written too late to actually make it onto wins poem the album begins with the ten minute song pill lights where you know you kind of see from the sound of the track you kind of see from the the length of the song just right at the start of the album that Phil is just being enjoyably obtuse just like he usually is he really kind of comes through with some interesting ideas at the beginning of this album incorporating elements of krautrock and drone just like on clear moon he's got some really kind of sharp guitars and an organ coming through on this track as well but this song eventually kind of segues to a quieter section where you do get some just glassy or softer organ and and Phil singing over it but how does the song make it into this section what actually happens is the louder portion just this louder instrumentation gets kind of faded down not like you know playing softer I mean it literally gets faded down and you just hear in the background faintly as this softer Instrumentation kind of gets introduced it literally kind of sounds like you've turned one song down to just kind of press play and listen to another one this loud portion of the song comes back how does it come back it just gets turned back up while mount jiri is about experimentation mount Airy's also to me about interesting ideas and there's nothing all that interesting about just kind of fading out a portion of a song to just kind of introduce another one and then fading it back up the next track on the LP though is very pretty has Phil singing against some lovely female vocal harmonies the instrumentation is very soft serene and it kind of boughs its head with some extremely just shockingly cheesy stock sound effects of children going yeah going yeah and people like applauding the only tracks that I really loved on this album were the black metal inspired tracks which I felt like we're even better than some of the black metal moments on wins poem there's just more tension to how the tracks build especially the song waves which literally you know feels like very kind of hypnotic waves of strong black metal guitar chords really heavy really awesome the track angled their left which is another black metal inspired track is way more chaotic and just heavy just way more speed to that song and I love it and it glides just segues perfectly into the next track I walked home beholding which was just a lovely ballad the instrumentals on this LP were okay they kind of bookended the only section of the album that I liked and you know the first one was nice really kind of moody dark I liked the woodwinds at the end of that track and the last one while it was black metal inspired it wasn't exactly an amazing moment for me and not even really a climactic closer I'm just really kind of torn on this Mount Erie LP unfortunately I can't help but feel like this thing is just a bunch of odds and ends and if it isn't you know all content created specifically for this album it does not flow all that well and there are just some production choices that are very very questionable I'm really kind of feeling a strong v on this release unfortunately what did you think of it if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next remember the good comment the great rate but only the strong subscribe Anthony Fantan oh now Yuri forever 
fLFHoY01a_w,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you review yen's Luqman I know what love isn't it's pretty avant-garde this is the third full-length album from this dude I believe it is the first LP in five years from the Swedish singer-songwriter and it's the follow-up to the reasonably celebrated night falls over courted alla a pretty elaborate and eccentric baroque pop LP loaded with colorful instrumentation and sounds and and lovely songs I'm talking horn and string flourishes harp piano glockenspiel as well as some scents and electronics and dance beats on this thing as well it's an album that's really kind of all over the place but yen's with his very lovestruck personality he's just kind of strong enough to pull it all together and just make it feel for the most part cohesive plus the LP was was a very important part of his artistic evolution because his debut album was someone was someone was just soaked in this painfully obvious magnetic fields influence which was cool but he really kind of came into his own on this LP and on this latest album there's still no question that yen's is is still doing his own thing and I feel like I'm I know what love isn't he definitely meets expectations but kind of manages to do it with less than his previous album less material less eccentricity less color instrumentation stuff like piano and strings and background vocals are still on this album but for the most part these songs really do kind of stick to those singer-songwriter roots of bass drums guitar and vocals and if I do have an issue with the instrumentation or the production overall on this album it's that the sounds just the the playing it can be a little too PG sometimes if you know what I'm saying like it's a little tone down and yet it also has this extremely happy cheery feel to it like I could totally hear the sound tracking me prancing gleefully down Sesame Street or something like that the instrumentation gets especially weird on the tracks you just don't want to be with you anymore where man this is just like some celine dion my heart will go on pan flute types at times i do kind of wish the melodies and and the tempo of these tracks matched up a little bit logically with the heartbreak and the emotional confusion that Yin's is going through on the stories with a lot of these tracks but still for the most part what you're gonna hear on this album is going to induce some very good mood vibes even if they are kind of a bit cloying at times is it too late to mention that sometimes the melodies the chord progressions the arrangements are a little too tried and true to be feeling all that fresh or amazing the real meat on this album comes from yen's himself his songwriting his singing his lyrics just his personality and how he consistently stays on the topics of love and and heartbreak still he brings the kind of charisma and poetic genius and hilarious musings and and unique perspectives that kind of make listening to stuff like this worth it all over again and that's apparent right from the first track where Yin sings Erica America I wish I'd never met you like I wish I'd never tasted wine or tasted it from lips that weren't mine now every drop tastes more bitter all the time and right after that particular lyrical moment in the song this schmaltzy saxophone comes swaggering and despite the fact that there is a lot of heartbreak and just relationship issues on this album Yin's does have an incredible amount of swagger which is why I definitely do not hesitate in recommending this album to anybody who liked that destroyer LP that dropped last year even though this album is much less drenched in 80s chic the next track on here is a funny anecdote not a friend's love interest kind of saying that man I wish there was a pamphlet saying so you think you're in love with Jennifer and the track kind of goes on to compare being in a relationship to being owned by somebody and and and preferring being free and Yin's eventually kind of takes more comfort in sleeping on his own arm to the point where he loses feeling and it feels like someone else's arm even though this album does feel incredibly sappy sometimes there was a strong anti SAP sentiment in some of the lyrics like when he invites this girl out to go see a band and she says no I hate bands I hate shows they're just filled with guys who are desperately spooning their girlfriends as if when they let them go they just float away there's a lot of humor in this guy's tales and he tells many of them very nonchalantly just kind of throwing around the word some stories that Yin's works into his tracks or more impressive than others like the song the world moves on it's the longest song on the LP and kind of details in the verses all these little moments of heartbreak and how you never quite get over that but you just kind of work out ways to handle it gracefully another track on here that makes an interesting statement the end of the world is bigger than love kind of a weird angle for an album with so many love obsessed songs but it's a point that yen's still makes but their points in the track where I kind of feel like lyrically he digresses a little bit and that kind of happens in in in a lot of spots on this album kind of being entertained by his own ability to throw in some non sequitur while still delivering a relatively smooth ride the last track on the LP I love and has a strong theme though it's a track about being close with someone and that person eventually being gone but just the memory of them everything reminds you of that person or remembers that person from the chords on your guitar to the hairs on your body overall I thought this was a really good LP if you're in the market for a singer-songwriter who has a lot of charm a lot of wit and some sweet melodies as well this is definitely worth checking out I'm kind of feeling a decent too strong seven on this album what did you think of it you've given it a listen did you love it hate it why and what should I review next remember the good comment the

MaD8AyoDcRc,oh hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Animal Collective centipede hurts this is the latest LP from Sonic experimentalists Animal Collective their ninth full-length album I believe maybe not their ninth LP technically as Animal Collective but their ninth LP together as a group of musicians and if you've been paying relatively close attention to underground independent music for the past eight to five years you have probably heard of Animal Collective and know a bit about the reputation the 2000s brought a league of new sounds expressions and ideas to the world of psychedelic rock and pop just neo psychedelia and as far as this new breed of psychedelic artists go very few of them were as bold and as strange and as polarizing as Animal Collective with one album after another the band would deliver indescribable sound effects and an extreme use of the sound effects and studio trickery that we're already familiar with shouted vocals harmonized vocals weird angular melodies inspiration coming from numerous styles of music coming from around the world it's kind of difficult to do an overarching you know kind of picture a description of the band style because there is a noticeable shift in in sound on every animal collective release they've always brought some kind of evolution whether it's to the wild and noisy and abrasive here comes the Indian or the very kind of harmonious and stripped down and pretty song tongs or the very fun inspiring and colorful strawberry jam now their last full length album Merriweather Post Pavilion was their biggest success yet and an album that was by far their poppy esteem really took their usual abrasiveness and threw it out of the window one of the members panda bear who would usually you know split songwriting duties with another member of the band AV tare really kind of took the reins on that record as far as singing and songwriting and as far as production and presentation goes Merriweather Post Pavilion was definitely their biggest and in glossiest album ever it was still an animal collective album but very very groomed as groomed as you were gonna get them while still maintaining what makes them fundamentally them plus the album just had some really fantastic singles brother sport summertime clothes and of course what pretty much dominated all of 2009 and just blog ability and remix ability my girls this album just brought an immense amount of hype toward them and just internet harvested independent music in general this LP a lot of ways just marks a huge turning point not only for Animal Collective but for psychedelic music as well how we as listeners share and talked about music and in the blogosphere that writes about this music every day earlier this year the band dropped a new single which I gave a very positive review to and there was the announcement that Deacon a member of the band who kind of took a temporary leave during the time the band was making Merriweather Post Pavilion was now back plus you had the track today supernatural which dropped before the release of this album kind of promoting toward the release of this album gave it a review very positive review love the song still love this song and to me that track forecasted a much rahrr noisier and just more strawberry jam esque kind of album which I was excited for and got to an extent but I can't help but feel a bit disappointed by the end product and the main reason is that for sure just easily no question this is the first time I am picking up a new animal collective album and the band has not introduced me to anything new wildly different or done anything surprising with their progression or evolution and now that that gripe is out of the way my second biggest gripe on this album the production is pretty underwhelming Merriweather Post Pavilion was certainly like I said Animal Collective spa piaced release but going more experimental mean kind of scaling back the big gargantuan presentation and and the lushness of their sound and making things just more muddy more messy the vocal harmonies the animal collective puts out no longer are soaring and then really kind of like awe inspiring they're really kind of grounded in in loads of effects and in a very claustrophobic mix the claustrophobic mix that really has every song kind of feeling too alike for comfort and really kind of kills a few of the very tender moments on this LP I felt like one of my favorite tracks on here Newtown burnout could have been more stripped-down near the end you know sans all the effects and wacky noises it just would have been a good tune I really can't help but feel like the sound effects on that track aren't helping or enhancing the music in the same way they would be on fields or strawberry jam centipede Hertz's is definitely really chaotic and hectic but it's kind of to the point where it's impeding on the enjoy ability of some of these tracks like the track mercury man for example which i think is the kinds of the kind of the kinds of the kind of the kinds of the best melody on this entire album and a nice kind of emphasis on the upbeat toward the beginning of the track kind of reminds me of like a psychedelic weird glitchy reggae tune or something like that but the thing is especially toward the end of the track where things get really kind of melodic you really kind of get more sounds in there the vocals which are really kind of just bringing all the emotion to the tune are just shoved down underneath everything and in a really I guess unflattering way or the song rosio which has a really great melody as well you have a bass a guitar of beat on their vocals but the thing is the the tune is good there's nothing really all that weird or psychedelic about the sounds of those instruments are making everything surrounding the track is what's kind of what's making a weird sound and to me it just kind of feels like well what's the point you could easily subtract all of these effects and the same exact tune I'm not seeing these sounds or effects adding to the song it's just kind of like looking at yourself in a foggy mirror and just like trying to wipe it and wipe it and wipe it and it just does not come clear the track monkey riches for example is another track that to me feels too chaotic to the point where the verse and the chorus just don't really have that much contrast when you hear that shift in the song there's not really a different feeling or anything like that the other issue that I have with this LP be the the smallest one that I have is the animal collective does not bring the usual interesting song structures or interesting melodies to some of these songs the track wide-eyed which i think is a deacon contribution to the album is a really monotonous track the sound of the guitars on that thing really call back to the older world of psychedelic rock which I didn't really care for all too much I know Animal Collective does have a huge Brian Wilson influence but this just felt kind of out of place to me plus the beat in just the phrasing of the guitar just everything about the track is just kind of monotonous the groove just kind of gets old and some reason deacons voice just has kind of a Jeff Mangum quality to it the song to me kind of feels like a glitched out Neutral Milk Hotel track the song pulleys is well toward the end of the album doesn't really have much of an impressive progression to it either overall I think this is a record that would have been fun to make but you know maybe not as fun to me to listen to I feel like I just got a good chunk of songs on this album kind of sounding more complicated than they really are just because so many effects are thrown on top of them I don't feel like Animal Collective has toned their sound down at all in a lot of ways they're they're more potent than ever but I can't help but feel like so many of these tracks for me personally would have had more impact if they actually felt kind of organized some better production would have helped that and I think it would have resulted in an album with with more variety typically I like dense albums but I just kind of found this LP to be a bit redundant and I find myself liking a lot of ideas on this album too oh this parts really lush that's a cool vocal that's a great melody that's an interesting sound but rarely did all of these characteristics or or just all of the stars align on these tracks and just make me think yes this is awesome from beginning to end just kind of felt like a lot of songs on here we're just underwhelming not horrible but underwhelming really kind of feeling the light too decent six on this thing what did you guys think if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next I'm sure a lot of you have questions about this review and I'm happy to to take one if you oh yes okay why do you hate the animal collections hmm I don't I don't hate Animal Collective um you're just gonna have to re-watch the review maybe take a breath calm down a little bit and realize that this is just an opinion and and and yeah that's it I still love you you know I do remember the good comment the great rate and the strong subscribe anthony Fantana Animal Collective forever [Music] 
tHcJpaXm0AQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you review murder construct results these guys are a metal outfit and a bit of an extreme music supergroup performing this incredibly tight technical and grimy brand of death metal infused with grindcore so you do get heavy dissonant guitars plenty of double bass drum death growls and on top of that the sporadic frenetic and and very intense and fast nature of grindcore kind of being executed within put together of course these guys are not the first to combine death metal and grindcore I mean the two genres really kind of came of age together and members of this band have played plenty of grind themselves in other bands like exhumed phobia foetus eaters also cattle decapitation a band that has put out one of the biggest grind albums of this year but the thing is these guys have also been in groups that kind of work outside of that grindcore circle as well they are coming together on this new full-length debut LP with a filthy dirty sound there's really nothing refined about the brutality on this album except for maybe the speed so I can assure you that on this thing overproduction is not a problem these guys are really fast but not too much about flash which can kind of be a pro or con on this album it does lead to some really just unrelenting pummeling brutality that just does not let up kind of redundant that sentence was but in this very unrelenting nature it can be difficult to kind of pull out unique qualities about every track despite the fact that they are there most of the tracks on this thing are around two minutes and that's great because nothing is worse than a grind song that just goes on for too long and over the course of these tracks murder construct works in a lot of nice progressions phases sections like the second track on here under the weight of wood which has some really nice hellish dark tremolo melodies and then chord progressions toward the beginning of the track and then around one minute 20 seconds this surprising bridge pops up out of nowhere and the bass line really kind of comes to the front of the song and place a nice counterpoint against the guitars and it's it's actually kind of surprising how much the bass does pop out in any given track on this album kind of rare for music this extreme I love the heavy and harmonized riffs and and guitar leads toward the end of the track compelled by mediocrity just really vile and the chord progression on the track dead hope actually kind of has like a slightly black metal quality to it even though this thing is pummeling especially with the drums which are incredibly detailed just so fast so perfect there is nice melody on this album as well but if the drums don't distract you from that the horrific vocals from extremely talented metal vocalists Travis Ryan will for a majority of this album his vocals are just swallowing the mix on this thing and it's really because he is kind of a man of a thousand demonic voices deep guttural ugly lows that get especially just on the track compelled by mediocrity when you kind of get a multitrack they're just different vocal takes just all kind of hitting your ears at once you do kind of have those straightforward death growls you do have shrill high-pitched wretches the guy is just all over the place and a lot of the times you'll hear these voices kind of trading spots off on the album you'll hear them singing together in unison which would be no surprise if you've heard this guy sing on any number of cattle decapitation albums the song structures on this LP which I already have mentioned a little do have a lot to offer in terms of variation as well like one of the longer tracks on here the three-minute track next life which comes right out just blazing just these drumbeats to me that that remind me of D beats blast beats heavy riffs and then right toward the middle the track just really kind of makes this quick transition to some really slower darker moody or arpeggios it's like the first part of the track really kind of beats you unconscious and then the second just throws you in a body bag and drags you away and the closing track on here too has a nice progression a nice change from beginning to end it starts off with just this really pummeling introduction which is a little run-of-the-mill but after that it slows down things get dark there's a musical passage the band is playing but all of a sudden you know it kind of fades and the same musical passage is being played but the instrumentation has changed into strings sitar piano hand percussion I thought the shift the transition was okay but once the instrumentation was there doing what it was doing it sounded good you know as far as negatives on this LP go there are some tracks that I do feel I kind of go by in a blur without really making a serious impact among a number of tracks that are so heavy and just hard fast and in-your-face another negative to me is that I kind of feel like yeah these guys got together in this supergroup to do this album but what did they really do here that they couldn't do in their respective bands or haven't already done to an extent if anything they've just kind of brought together all the best qualities of their respective bands and then just kind of put them on one record which isn't a bad thing now I know a lot of you guys who watch the channel on a regular basis are not into music like this necessarily I mean you know tread lightly be open-minded it's kind of like eating broccoli rabe you know music like this if you eat a vegetable like broccoli rabe you know what's gonna hit you first if you've never tried it before is the strong strong strong bitter taste but if you learn to cook with it taste it what you should or shouldn't pair it with food wise you not only taste past that bitterness once you know you get used to it but you also learn to kind of appreciate the bitterness in balance with everything else the food has to offer I'm feeling a light too decent ate on this album if you guys give it a listen what did you think about it did you love it did you drink that why and what should i review normal collections minimal collections minimal collections animal collections but remember the good comment the great rate and only the strong

owZQq8IU8oA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd time for a full-length album review holy other help holy other held this guy is a UK music producer this is full-length debut album on triangle records you know the record label that houses new music from clams Casino Balam good Evie in Christ many more oh whoa whoa oh oh oh whoa whoa this label pretty much covers the deeper darker more atmospheric side of beat music very Spacey Basie and fog machine worthy electronic music all over this label if that even sounds remotely interesting to you and you have no clue a triangle records is I implore you go check them out and when it comes to all of those adjectives that I just used wholly other definitely follows suit and the with you EP that he dropped last year kind of set the tone for his musical style very ethereal and glossy synthesizers samples and drones kind of building a really really vast and in that soundscape he cuts a lot of very emotive and and well-executed vocal samples in a way it kind of reminds me of like burial but slow Jamz like a romantic version of burial holy other definitely has influences from the worlds of hip-hop and downtempo a lot like the other people on the triangle Records label but there's almost this like subtly implied R&B influence on on his music and it's not like you know necessarily poppy catchy upbeat commercial radio R&B it is like slow jam R&B but played at like half speed these extremely molasses slow wet silky you know musical experiences all these characteristics added up to a very good ep and now holy others kind of taking them to a full-length LP and there are some standout tracks like tens past and and past tension or the title track on here - all of which features some some nice beats and grooves slow like I said some nice vocal samples as well tense past and past tension that I just mentioned they are kind of sister tracks that share a lot in common though there are actually a lot of songs on this LP that share many things in common they're actually songs on this LP that share a lot in common with songs from holy others EP that he dropped last year specifically the track no where with the opener of this album where but with the W in parentheses I think from the titles that the similarities between these two tracks is is kind of being implied like I said I do like the fact that all the other executes his style pretty well I mean he has a style does it well and he incorporates some interesting influences on this LP like future garage you will kind of get some future garage rhythms kind of popping up here and there and I would say even though the atmosphere is Spacey and slow it is not very druggie you know it's it's just kind of cavernous maybe sexy maybe also kind of cold - I do get that feeling from tracks on here as well kind of cold maybe a little bleak my main issue with this LP though is that some tracks really do not hit as well as others and kind of go by without really kind of a unique or or interesting characteristic about them whether it be a good vocal sample or just a beat or a synth texture that is specific to that track there is a lot of redundancy on this album and that's why I don't think this album really has enough variety even across it's it's pretty short 35 minutes to really kind of be an album you know the mood and the atmosphere and the production is there but as a whole listening experience from beginning to end it gets really kind of mundane I guess there were a lot of tracks on here that just felt shallower than others and I just couldn't really dive into them because there wasn't a lot to listen to but you know there's still some good tracks to take away from this thing and overall I do like wholly others style and I found this thing to be you know decent at least likable feeling a light decent six on this thing what did you guys think of it if you've given it a listen love it hate it why and what should I review next remember the good comment the great rate but only the strong subscribe Anthony Fantana all the other held forever 
CS4HP_-HEdI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review for tetes pink thank you okay this is the latest release from longtime electronic music producer Kieran Hebden aka Forte who has spent a good chunk of this year sporadically releasing tracks on 12-inch singles off of his self started record label text records and this thing pink is pretty much a compilation of those released tracks now at this point his career for tête has kind of abandoned the really instrumentally russian and layered electro-acoustic instrumentals that make albums like rounds you know his album rounds so celebrated I don't mean to make that sound bitter because I actually you know like the direction that he's been heading and especially on his last full-length album there is lovin you which was one of my favorite electronic music albums of 2010 and there are references to his old self on this album especially on the last track she only likes to fight which is a really pretty track and has a post-rock esque instrumental escalation but for the most part these days four tet has been embracing the hypnotic repetitive sounds of house music but his angle when it comes to house music tech house micro house is to just create some really subtle sounds very pretty and nicely executed vocal samples as well examples from there's love and you love cry and and the opening track as well and that mix of house music structure and repetition together with his his usual experimentation his search for some some interesting sounds is here on pink I would actually say on this compilation Summa for tetes most textured beats ever are on this thing it starts right from the get-go on the track lock which has some really nice hand percussion and the beat there's just a lot of interesting sounds going on I mean that is just really what makes a lot of these tracks just really nice quality and and unique sounds what does kind of bug me about this track and a lot of tracks on this compilation though is that nothing is introduced or built upon or just sort of it added to a track all that subtly or with a delicate hand you have a lot of hard ins and outs it's not the worst thing in the world but it does kind of bring a robotic quality too for tetes production that I wasn't totally in love with I'm used to him really just kind of sequencing things or introducing things with I don't know a bit more Flair and I wouldn't say it's it's it's a complete lack of effort or anything like that because once certain sounds start in these tracks for Ted does work to kind of keep a nice progression going like the pops and clicks that fill the beat on the track Jupiters or the rolling just just strangely sequenced high hats on the track 128 harps and of course the UV harp sound on that track as well as is beautiful the last track out here pinnacles though is is easily my favorite has an amazing rush of just sounds and instrumentation that that just kind of hops in every so often when these jazzy piano chords kind of a rise in the track it's the only song here that to me really references that older side of for tet where you are hearing a lot of acoustic instrumentation and it sounds like it's it's kind of happening live it's easily the most detailed track on the album but a lot of other tracks on here kind of underwhelming because of their lack of detail I just don't find them to be as engaging good beats and grooves but you know hmm because the way some of these tracks move tends to be a little mundane for me sometimes and and maybe obvious as well because the execution of some of these tracks can't kind of deflate my excitement for them pretty fast like on a chorus or lion or pyramid the the tracks on here though are a feast I even really liked the 11 minute track piece for Earth which is kind of a very long vast ambient synthesizer piece which was was kind of breathtaking and it's in its simplicity III didn't really come away loving this compilation I just felt like some tracks were really not as stimulating as others this is definitely a must listen for for tet fans and even worth checking out for people who may just be curious about his stuff because while it wasn't mind-blowing it certainly was easy to get into and could be a nice starter for some people I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this thing what did you guys think of it if you've given oh listen did you love it hate it why remember the good comment the great rate but only the strong subscribe Anthony Fantana for Ted forever 
BFCQItmLjww,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review slaughterhouse this is our house but you don't eat and it's that's just the name of the group it's not and nothing died to make this album but it's it's a spider house they kill chickens there you don't know that's that's fine you know you have it your your way you had it your way these guys are kind of a hip hop supergroup featuring Joell Ortiz crooked eye Joe Budden and Royce de 5/9 this is their new LP on Shady Records and the image that these guys push forward that they're they're marketed with is that they're really sharp lyricist they are hardcore hip-hop lyricists and individually I feel like each of them have kind of proven that especially Royce to 5/9 who's had his share of of solo successes and I know a lot of people were really impressed with what Shady 2.0 had to offer during the bTW cypher and I was pretty excited going into this LP wondering what slaughterhouse had to offer at this point in their career considering that one of the last pieces of music I heard from them collectively was on the back end of that bad meets evil EP that Royce - five nine and Eminem put together and that track is just straight lyrical fire but I gotta say as a group together on this new LP each of these guys really just kind of cancel each other out you do not get one lick of the Nibin that competitive edge that chemistry because you don't really get an intense sense that these guys are really working together tag-teaming these instrumentals and song concepts building on one another's lyrics trying to top one another you just track after track after track kind of here these guys apathetically trade verses as if you know my time is done whatever which is really disappointing because that's just the opposite direction that these guys should have gone in from their full-length debut which would have been great if there was just a bit more fire between these guys just some kind of spark I feel like welcome to our house just kind of confirms that together slaughterhouse doesn't really do anything that they couldn't do individually especially with Shady Records in the picture even the verses on the most aggressive track here coffin are pretty subdued lyrically and flow wise as well just vocal delivery wise Busta Rhymes who's featured on the hook on this track sounds ten times more hyped than anybody else on this track and when crooked eye drops that line about the most beautiful thing in this world are the funerals I bring into this world just not good so just one kind of big negative about this album right off the bat is that the aggressive hard-as-nails tracks are just not really that aggressive or hard as nails to make matters worse there are just a load of commercial flowery overly melodic hooks on the other tracks that aren't trying to be hard at all and I can't help but feel like these hooks wouldn't have been there if Shady Records wasn't in the picture especially considering that a lot of the hooks on this thing sound like they could have been on Eminem's recovery or the album before that it's really fitting that b.o.b is actually on one of the bonus tracks from this LP because a slaughterhouse is really going down that direction because the instrumentals and the course is on this thing do get that sugary sometimes the only thing that really kind of is majorly setting b.o.b apart from slaughterhouse right now is that b.o.b is actually catchy you may ask Anthony why do you care so much about the courses and the instrumentals on a slaughterhouse album I don't listen to slaughterhouse for the courses and the instrumentals well the thing is neither do i I don't want to listen to slaughterhouse for those things either that's why I question their existence if flowery choruses and instrumentals are important to slaughterhouses music then why are they there and for those of you at this point who may still think that slaughterhouses is a group of very cunning lyricists I mean have you heard some of the tracks on this LP a lot of them quickly and and lyrically are crumby like the frat house track where Joel crooked I Royce to 5/9 Joe they're all rapping about keg stands and one line about how her puss is as hot as a chili pepper and she wants to give it away and girls on the floor like it's a crack house on the hook it's just a ridiculous song it's more ridiculous than summer on smash on nas's new album how old are these guys should they really be rapping about this and on the track park it sideways like man the hooks on some of these tracks are so lavender they're exactly like the courses on that last Lupe album I mean how are they really any different especially on that my life track with CeeLo on the hook like what were they thinking on that hook like if we get CeeLo to say click on it we'll have another hit or something and what's up with that rescue me track 2 or they're all rapping about like being disturbed or you know psychotic or just like having mental issues or whatever there's not one single moment where slaughterhouse really gets together and tells a story that actually suspends my belief and makes me just get into what they're saying and whether or not you're impressed by slaughterhouses vocabulary that is the ultimate goal the suspension of belief putting somebody in a place that you're trying to detail for them in their empty brags or just they're they're really just awkward topical tracks it just never ever happens I feel like the only sane person on this entire album is Swizz Beatz on the track throw it away at least he had the common sense to sample ESG the only somewhat traditional hip hop thing that this album does despite all the references to real hip hop and lyricist toward the beginning of this LP should I be surprised signing to Shady Records ruined yellow Wolf's new LP to I mean of course it was going to happen to this but what are you gonna do honestly I am feeling a strong three to a life four on this thing I really can't say I liked it any more than that what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next Anthony Fantan oh slaughterhouse forever 
96slWZRmBWU,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review featuring cow - is this really what you wanted to call you yes couch' chesta and the swagga muffins he's at Cal there he is he knows the biz he knows the biz he's got a mustache and can drugs sweet sir with swag swag swag swag [Music] this is a review of the new ASAP mob mixtape Lords never worry ASAP mob is a new hip-hop outfit from New York City fronted by MC main brain hip-hop personality ASAP rocky who released a pretty big mixtape last year Live Love ASAP that I reviewed personally and and gave a very positive review to and for good reason it was really fresh sounding mixtape you know the dude just came out with a hybrid of pretty interesting styles put together in a way that just sounded like a great idea the songs on this mixtape reference everything from spacious little B style cloud rap to bone thugs-n-harmony and there was something very southern about a lot of the beats on this thing too with the chopped and screwed vocal samples and and instrumentals I also kind of like ASAP Rocky's very simplistic minimal flow over these very spacious shoegaze II kind of ethereal instrumentals the guy has a full-length album his debut album coming out later this year but in the meantime to kind of hold fans over he has released this new mixtape with his ASAP outfit and I got to say to be completely honest this thing was an extreme disappointment there is not an angle at which you can look at this tape that would make it look pretty first let's kind of take on this thing instrumentally because let's be honest the instrumentals were a huge huge part in making live love ASAP good not just good but great catchy and awesome but now that that atmospheric intoxicating cloud rap production is really popular and really hot right now you can just about find any producer on the internet willing to just copy that style and that's what I feel like it's happening on here especially with the tracks purple kisses way to go even the one clams casino B isn't even really one of his best they are just riding some really cut-rate druggy cloud rap instrumentals that do not sound as vast or as lush or just as as amazing as the beats that were on that live love ASAP tape when ASAP mob isn't trying to chase after what actually made ASAP Rocky's mixtape good they're rapping over really generic southern trap instrumentals which is really disappointing to me because I thought that these guys despite you know the shallow nature of their lyrics would kind of stick to their guns keep developing their own thing and just not try to copycat what's hot right now not be reactionary instrumentals overall are very forgettable but there are a handful of highlights I love the heavy horns on that bath salts track that features Flatbush zombies Flatbush zombies bring a really you know psychotic flow just really kind of cartoony zany delivery with their vocals I wasn't too hot in there drugs mixtape but I am liking their feature here the track Persian wine is really deep bassy kind of murky and I love that very lone solemn piano flourish that kind of pops up on the instrumental it's a nice piece of color the instrumental and the way it go just sounds slowed down smooth sexy kind of has a G Funk vibe to it but I'm liking that it's kind of like a sex and they're something I can't quite make out i but still this this mixtape did not deliver that forward-thinking production that I was hoping for and you know if the bargain bin beats on this thing we're not bothering you the clearance rack rhymes will for those of you who are really hating Live Love ASAP because ASAP rocky can't rap or you think he's a terrible rapper just wait until you hear every other member of his crew not a single member of ASAP Rocky's ASAP mob can out rap him a few of them like ASAP Ferg and ASAP ant can barely stay on tempo but what's an even bigger issue for all these guys regardless of whether or not their flow is on point is that vocally they are just also kind of generic and uninteresting especially when it comes down to the lyrics because in terms of lyrical style subject matter pretty much everything these guys have to say doesn't really stretch out too far past what you've already heard ASAP Rocky rap about on numerous tracks making this easily one of the most redundant mixtapes of 2012 there are a couple interesting features on here including Danny Brown Flatbush zombies like I said Jim Jones even makes it onto this mixtape and Raekwon the chef is on one of the tracks toward the end however I would advise you not to listen to that track unless you're ready to actually hear Raekwon refer to himself as being like ASAP Rocky's big brother I'm feeling a light too decent three on this thing but what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantana ASAP mob forever [Music] [Music] 
ZAKIxgzgNJ8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd albums this long take a lot out of me in this album is the seer the latest LP from the longtime experimental rock outfit swans I've covered this band before on the channel reviewed their last LP in 2010 which at the time was their first album in over ten years the band broke up in the 90s ended up performing in the in the 2000s and there is a bit more information in that review you can watch it it's linked in the description box of this video now truth be told swans returned to putting out studio records was not as exciting for me as it was for some other people and not because I'm not a fan I am I just felt like swans last effort was a bit of a letdown unfortunately kind of subdued a none adventurous for a record carrying the swans name there were a lot of very dark funky sounds on this record and despite the fact that the band has indulged in sounds like that before on previous records I couldn't help but feel like this album was more like a michael gira solo LP or a record from another one of his side projects Angels of Light which wasn't completely surprising considering that a lot of the members in this current phase of swans career were previously collaborating with jira on that project before he kind of jumped and did the swans thing I really just kind of came away from rope to the sky hoping that the band was just getting warmed up and I feel like the seer confirms that the band's definitely kind of getting the ball rolling again on dishing out the sounds that that I would normally associate with this band you know the noisy experimental inspiringly weird and challenging music that they're known for because they're really getting back to the longer tracks those drones just that that overall strangeness that was so awesome about the later period of swans career with loads of drones cacophonous instrumentation noise escapes and mind-numbing repetition and of course michael gira is very disturbing lyrics and and abrasive sounds of all shapes and sizes rumbling overpowering over modulated shrill love that word considering the kind of music the band puts out swans fans are really the type of people who beg to be tortured and abused and on this LP swans are happy to oblige the most impressive thing about this LP overall I would say easily is the fact that swans maintain such a high high level of tortured despair for a majority of this two-disc two hour-long very ambitious album which I will start describing right from the beginning I will try to keep my descriptions of tracks and musical moments succinct because I really do feel like I could talk for as long as this album lasts now the opening track on the first disc lunacy just has an amazingly hellish chorus on it it is just bone-chilling and the track actually features members of the band low hell of how these chorus vocals just trade spots with some really heavy abrasive instrumentation it is the perfect opener for this thing it kind of sets the stage for what you're gonna get throughout the album some strange vocals a little bit of organ in there I believe some guitar and some hammered dulcimer as well kind of chopping it up in the mix the next track mother of the world has these really sharp repetitive riffs on it guitar riffs that that play this very stuttering groove that is very unlike any groove I have heard in any sort of rock inspired song it's very attention grabbing and you can hear Michael Cera's vocal on the track just it's just heavy breathing into the microphone is just weird like I listen to this tracking and other tracks on this album and just think what are you doing it's freaking me out man at first I wasn't too impressed with this track thought it was a little too repetitive the groove itself is repetitive but the band works to subtly build atmosphere around this groove more instrumentation just more sounds kind of fly-in swans really do love repetition on this LP I like the subdued outro on this track too that it kind of breaks into after after a really intense build-up is very mournful very funky now the title track in the middle of this first disc is thirty minutes long and it is surprisingly cohesive considering its length however this is not the first long-form song that swans has written like this the only thing that really kind of feels disconnected from the rest of the track is the very noisy drone that introduces the whole thing and it kind of dies out before the real meat of the track begins and the track features this really slowly building groove before Michael Gira's vocals just kind of get multi-tracked on top of each other and in this very kind of chanting repetitive hypnotic way he's trying to sing I see it all I see it all I see it all and really strange and the track builds into a very high high noisy just ear-shattering climax and right after that it just kind of breaks into these syncopated hits of drums guitar just basically every instrument the swans can muster all crashing down over and over and over I should also mention that there are some slower moments on this track that also kind of remind me of God's beat but I digress back to this crashing instrumentation though this point can seem especially repetitive maybe the most repetitive point on the entire album work and it can really kind of drag on I'm sure for a first-time listener but every time you get a hit you get a crash of instrumentation swans work to kind of make the dissonance qualities of these hits different like subtly different either there are just different tones buried in the crashes or they are just slowly getting more and more intense or or altered as the track progresses and I really like the dusty soundscape that finishes the track off there's a nice harmonica in there it's it's a really interesting serene calm after the storm the track the seer returns features Jarboe on the track you know coming back into the fold with swans although I found her vocal contribution on the song to be maybe a little too subtle I would have loved to have heard her just more front-and-center this track features one of the more straightforward grooves on the entire LP and it could even be catchy and kind of easy to show people who don't know about swans if it were not for Michael Gira's very freakish vocal delivery and and and narrations this group is jammed out with more intense energy as the track continues on it's a song that I wish kind of came to more of an interesting climax to be completely honest I do think it's a little bit underwhelming because it doesn't really have a point be really kind of just getting loud and then it's you know kind of it the track afterwards though 93 Ave that is totally the kind of mind I go to a swans album to hear there are these wailing strings coming from all directions and man all the gaps between the sounds just keep getting filled more and more and more until things are just just unbearably sharp and ugly I love the deadpan chorus vocals on this track as well and man do things get loud and just oh I don't have a word for it it's so goddamn loud toward the end of this track everything just all at once it's like murder its sonic music murder it is murder on the track on the second disc you get a nice little experimental fault opener that features Karen O on vocals it has very tried and true chord progression very dusty it has some very heavenly layers of indescribable instrumentation kind popping in between some of her verses and and ending the song off it's you know kind of a treat for anybody who has kind of made it through the album so far like hey hey here here's here's a nicer track for you since you just sat through all that you know the song avatar after that has a nice groove a cool chord progression very nice instrumental progression very s collective not a word whatever maybe it is I just made it up it is a word there's some really cool bells on the track and I would really love it if it were not for the just I'm gonna say it bad lyrics just bad lyrics on this track my eye is in your eye is just like constantly just switching out words it's like a fill-in-the-blank lyrical scheme that is just not interesting at all but still despite that I would say the second disc is so much more solid than the first more cohesive than the first even with the two 20-minute tracks that end it which at this point it should I even describe them in detail I mean you know if you've made it this far through the album and you're enjoying yourself you're gonna like these two tracks the first of the two tracks I kind of think of as being a short acoustic ballad that has a 15 minute long intro the drone that starts this track off is very sound rich I love the just multi-tracked hammered dulcimers that just oh man they just really just rock my brain when they pop in it's it's very overwhelming and the groove that pops in shortly after that and the way it kind of you know coasts downward into something very kind of smooth and friendly and heavenly is is nice and the last track on here is just oblivion it is just everything getting destroyed it is just pure filth ugliness just oh man while I wasn't so in love with this LP at first I was pleasantly surprised and very happy upon further listening to really get a grip of how frightening how twisted how sick how dark how just freakish strange unsettling disturbing this album is I feel like because of the length of the album and the repetition of some of the songs that is not necessarily going to sink in on a first impression and you know I'm also going to come out and say that some songs on here are for some people going to be unnecessarily long pretentious to experimental just masturbatory but it is because of that masturbatory nature the swans has that they are just able to plunge their hands and just reach deeper and darker then a lot of bands can and that's just all about I have to say about this LP really an album that is too large for words to be completely honest however I don't feel like that means that this album is without its flaws there are some underwhelming moments you know there are some spots that I wish had a bigger climax I there are some spots that I wish had a bit more instrumental variation still despite my small gripes this this is an album nez deserving of the swans name I'm feeling a light decent 8 on this thing what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana swans the seer forever [Music] 
U-MRU5VBrWY,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd my needle drops and it's time for a review the faceless Auto theism a little bit of metal [Music] Wow dude dude light - yeah the faceless is a technical melodic and pretty progressive death metal band from California this is their third full-length album it's been about four years since the band released their last LP planetary duality and for a lot of fans it has been worth the wait merely because of the amount of progression that this band has shown on this new LP now LP is like planetary duality are just nothing but straight-up proficient brutality clean production with no room for four errors or muddiness some amazing drumming to back it all up and some really surprising colorful and just very interesting and creative segues breaks and riff changes which all kind of wind the tracks on this LP into some very unpredictable song structures this is definitely worth looking into if technical death metal is what you're after however in the case of this you know let's start with one of my biggest issues with this LP and it is just the overall lack of just direct impact that this LP has I just don't think the songs the playing on this album is as fast as abrasive as winding the overall energy is just not as savage I feel like the faceless take a lot of the exciting and interesting and progressive riffs that are usually in their music and trained them in trade them in for slower moody or more melodic guitar passages and a set of clean vocals that I can not stand but the vocals are my real issue on this album the melodies overall to me just just the the less brutality that this album has to offer would be fine if I felt like that the more melodic parts weren't being delivered so that you could have these really campy vocals on top of them it just starts right from the beginning with three tracks which are kind of like a suite for the album it is the Auto theose movement I'm impressed with how the band can write these multifaceted songs with a lot of detail the somber piano and the strings that just start this LP off just sound like they could fit very properly into a cinematic funeral procession but once those vocals kick in my potential for loving this thing is just drained because to me it sounds like a pretty run-of-the-mill radio metal vocal that you usually hear soaring over the hook and the way that sometimes they intertwine with the death growls it just really leaves a bad taste in my ears introducing clean vocals into extreme metal doesn't necessarily equate to a bad thing in in all cases I just feel like in the case of faceless it's a move toward not experimentation but but the middle-of-the-road now the second part of the auto theists movement is is a little bit more like it I like those tight drums and guitars just pushing out some really brutal vicious melody and riffing and I actually like the way the band starts incorporating keyboards and some symphonic sounds just seeping them in slowly on the track that to me is is fleshing the sound out in a tasteful way but once those clean vocals pop in again it just dies for me and it kind of feels like something off of the last opeth LP the third part of the Otto feeis movement sounds even more like the last Opeth LP especially with the lead singer crooning very dramatically that God is dead and things start sounding really tacky when this circus instrumentation starts popping in out of nowhere it just kind of feels like something a much more sporadic band like mr. bungle or or Fantomas would do with with a much more interesting angle at times operatic vocals will will sort of pop in on this moment of the album which just totally screamed Devin Townsend to me but on a less grandiose scale making it kind of less impressive after the third track the faceless sort of starts getting back to the band that I know they can the clean vocals I don't care for are still there but just not on the level that they were during that first third the type very well played and unforgiving guitars are back I'm loving those melodies despite the fact that this band is pretty extreme they have a nice sense of melody at their fingertips I'm loving the chord progression on the track accelerated evolution and the song after it to the syncopated explosion of drums and distorted guitar chords and then guitar leads on the closing track here is awesome as well the melody especially reminds me of something off of that last Agalloch LP I do think these guys have a nice ear for some interesting sounds as well like when you hear the very metallic percussion on the introduction of the track 10 billion years but still whenever these guys take me out of brutal high they just drop me down to the pits of just boredom and and lack of interest when they lay on those ultra melodic moments that don't really have a lot of pomp to them and incorporate those vocals that just are really kind of nasally at some points bland at some points they didn't want to put out the same record again you know but I'm just not sure if this was the way to flesh things out to grow things too I guess build upon the model I'm very very on the fence with this LP unfortunately I'm feeling a strong five on this but if you've listened to it and I know some of you out there have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana the faceless Auto theism forever you [Music] 
vdIL2Slt9yM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review featuring kal in the two Chester's oh man phew dear I think you're great but don't get cocky because no one likes that either Wow Wow um review time Matthew Deere beams this guy is a producer DJ singer and co-founder of one of the most forward-thinking electronic music labels today ghostly international beams is this dude's fifth full-length album and the follow-up to what was pretty much his breakthrough LP black city on which he presented a pretty definitive sound the structures and just delivery of micro house and techno executed with the darkest and strangest textures and tones imaginable and he graced these visceral shadowy grooves with his very moody baritone vocal what was really kind of keeping me from loving that LP though is that I felt some of the beats didn't have enough variation enough progression to them and lyrics kind of tend to be a weak point for Matthew on on this LP as well however like I said he does have a style all his own which he does evolve on on theme he beams now overall this LP does have that same dark and tortured delivery that you expect from Matthew deer but I would say this is maybe easily his most upbeat project yet he hems back the reverb he heads back the obscurity he heads back just that feeling of desolation and he delivers a series of focused beats where the instrumentation is not only clear but kind of colourful maybe even bordering on bubbling though I would say they are more like Tarr bubbles but when the Tarbell's pop they smell like pink bubble gum especially on the track ahead of myself which to me instrumentally is is a very surprising change from the sometimes very bleak black city and what's awesome is that this change has not ruined the feel or the emotions of Matthew dears music I actually think it's made him a more interesting character because on beans the clash between the fun danceable beats and the very weird strange sounding man singing over them is that much greater like on the track do the right thing it's a softer track on this LP has a very pleasing beat a nice soft cowbell in there strategically placed some glassy synthesizers and Matthew dears very bellowing croon keeping things kind of creepy because as he's singing and that is creepy in and of itself he's thrown out these lyrics about digging a grave or about how his heart weighs a ton in snakes or how his flesh is burning like a ton of flames falling from the Sun I actually think this track is the sweetest piece of synth pop I've ever heard from this guy and yet it is disturbingly morbid it's a pretty surreal song especially when you look at the lyrics actually for me a lot of the slower tracks on here do get pretty surreal even the last track on here temptations it's a track that to me is just equal parts seductive and unsettling but the songs on here that are even best at that first one seductive are the ones that have the harder beats like the opening track on here her fantasy which features all these strange synth loops I mean a sea of different textures from glassy and just smooth to soaring and then vibrant or just kind of like darken and rough and the groove underneath these since just totally remind me of David Byrne Talking Heads I would actually say those two things are the most prevalent influence on this entire LP I've never heard Talking Heads come through so strong on this dude's music and as long as we're making comparisons there are moments on this LP that totally remind me of like Nine Inch Nails and there's something in the back of my head that just totally says hey man when he croons sounds a bit like Marilyn Manson if that pisses you I don't give a look and despite this newfound level of color Matthew dears personality is is just as odd and freakish as ever even on a track like head Cage which came from Matthew dears previous EP which I didn't really like but I did like that track head Cage is really the Poppaea song on here and has a hook about going out tonight and even though that vocal is a little corny it is corny though the lyrics are a bit corny he does kind of give this very eerie quality to just kind of leaving the house and just kind of sneaking out to have a good time now if I do have some gripes with this LP the second-to-last track on here is definitely a little underwhelming but maybe more of a grower the tracks up and out and over time do to me kind of rely on repetition a little bit too much there's enough progression for me plus those two tracks for whatever reason they're right next to each other kind of fizzle out at the end as opposed to ending abruptly or kind of pulling together a proper finish but I'm really enjoying all the other tracks on here a lot and what I guess I'm most impressed by on on this LP is that like black City this album does have a sense of place and I like that Matthew Deere was able to keep things dark keep things weird but bring a different place to the listener it's an album that to me lives in this weird dimension that that for some reason is both gloomy gloomy and like inviting like you want to be there you know I've tried really hard to talk about and describe the overall experience of this album and yet I still kind of feel like I have fallen short but that's just really kind of overall how I feel about this thing feeling a strong eight and remember though this album is coming from a weird place it is not going to feel totally alien to you I mean you know you have poppy hooks on here you have since you have Beats you have loops samples vocals lyrics all things that are familiar to you and yet they kind of create this otherworldly sensation and and that's really what I'm loving about it um yeah that's it what did you guys think of this album did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next remember the good comment great rate strong subscribe and and that's it thanks for watching love you 80k dance forever 
yPDFdmEE4_M,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd with Chris capella virya not the Internet's physics music there but I work for the Internet's position work with I want win I reckon we employed and make him less busy he mixing a little less busy thankfully and I appreciate it this week I was talking with Chris about something I've kind of been musing about for a few days partially because of a few things that had recently happened or you know things that keep coming up in music the most recent occurrence sort of being that surfer blood thing yeah where they were talking about how the frontman from the group or I'd been reading on some websites has been arrested for domestic abuse and you know just sort of like was was violent toward his girlfriend you know from what I had been reading and another coincidence is that the very night that I was doing my Shiv Alba review the band is now kind of facing accusations online of sexual harassment you know of course another example would be Chris Brown you know who of course with his assault on Rihanna has kind of made him a black sheep in the music industry and um you know of course these are all like you know male on female you know sexual harassment you know violence kind of issues but I'm not necessarily talking about these issues simply basically assholes in the music industry assholes who make music people who do you know seedy stuff how do you perceive them after kind of this stuff has come out to the public this kind of question ultimately comes down to whether it comes down to whether we as music listeners should you know have our opinions about an individual the artist making music inform our opinions of the music itself and I think that in the case of people like Chris Brown who are not just musicians but actually occupies some sort of you know place in the public eye as celebrities whether it be entertainer right they have more of an obligation to not act like an asshole if they expect that kind of you know action or you know behavior to inform their fans or just everyone else who is watching them their opinions of that individual but with a guy like you know the guy from Surfer blood you're right that the the reaction is probably going to be less intense because there isn't as much of a public eye on him I would actually not be surprised really if you know the reaction against Surfer Bloods music in the future was definitely if not entirely negative at least negatively informed by the you know coverage that this incident is been getting do you think we don't get a lot of coverage like that I mean you know you just talked about the drug abuse thing and it reminded me of Jay retard I mean do you think that we don't see this kind of coverage all the time from major media outlets that cover music or just independent music because it's not really happening or because indie bands are better at keeping it on the hush-hush or there's just not really all that much money or interest in that kind of thing I mean I think it's all about the angle that the websites are going for them in music especially independent music tends to kind of glamour either that is the media that covers you know independent music tends to glamorize the you know sort of not necessarily the rock and roll lifestyle but really the lifestyle of the tortured artist you know I think drug abuse goes with that and sometimes you know general like asshole behavior can go with that but one thing that really doesn't ever go with anything and certainly doesn't make anyone seem like a sympathetic character is you know domestic abuse or really murder I mean you know if we're going to talk about that as well which you know those are both things that go well beyond I think the idea of you know what's what's considered asshole behavior as opposed to just like totally unacceptable behavior it's kind of like that that other instance that occurred when Action Bronson saw some some fire because of the water I guess him or a friend had spilled on someone that they thought was transsexual at the time but I guess it just ended up being a woman and I also want to say that also in the internet age you have a completely different you know thing to consider because I mean I guess in the just the television or radio age it's it's it's the same but in the Internet age I feel like things can snowball so much faster because a piece of information doesn't necessarily need to be leaked by a news organization who may or may not sort of strategically think of how to deliver it you know you just may have some person that has a piece of information and throws it out there whether or not they think it's 100% accurate you know sort of in the case of the issue of all the thing where a lot of the accusations that will probably pretty much all the accusations of sexual abuse being committed by them are just being done online I saw a screenshot of like text messages on a phone Tumblr posts from the person who is the alleged victim and from the band themselves both very well-written but kind of also containing things and both of them that seemed a little fishy I kind of feel like the negative you know and the hardcore scene is just known for stirring up such strong emotions and in any direction you know it seems like how the reception is going to be depends on what piece of information is linked is leaked first to people you know another situation of something seedy but also the information that was first leaked to people kind of being in the opposite direction was that situation Lamb of God is going through right now where the lead singer has been accused of murder while they were overseas on tool tool tour and most of the reception over here has been pretty supportive toward the band from their fans this whole sort of predicament especially with when you're talking about you know negative things bad things that artists do it calls to mind actually a zine that I heard was being created online I believe called the it's complicated project in which a bunch of feminist writers are examining a lot of art that they believe is really you know great but that they have problems with as feminists right that they think of as in some there's mystic right and a lot of it is about music and so I think that that kind of that kind of questioning is an important thing to do because even though it's not I don't think it's good to discount art just because you have a problem with the person who's creating it but I do think that it's important to recognize you know that there's some kind of philosophical disconnect between you and what you're listening to exactly I mean it's I think I think it's important to recognize the creator of the art that you're talking about that you're experiencing because that can often give you insight into the ways in which you should appreciate it and then that's and that's another thing it's like uh what about music that you have a character you know let's just say Kanye because I think he's the biggest example somebody who you know clearly has done asshole type things you know like the Taylor Swift incident which is of course probably the the biggest I mean nothing heinous like what Chris Brown has done publicly you know that was discussed in the public arena as far as we know but the thing is what about a guy like Kanye who clearly has done asshole things but makes music where he sort of acknowledges his asshole personality and just sort of sings about it and I want to say glorifies it but you know at least acknowledges it in his music and sort of to an extent make songs about it especially on you know My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy where he's really kind of you know going into depth and discussing it at length well I think that Kanye is a really interesting example because he is really like you said kind of this quintessential you know example of you know assholes in music a musical asshole who is unrelentingly an asshole I mean he is thoroughly an asshole but he's so self-aware about it and I mean I think that that to me is one of the reasons that my Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is at least an important album if not a great album although I think it is great album you know it's this idea that you can make music that is so opulent and so grandiose and is about and and and so thoroughly expresses certain qualities of Kanye West's persona and yet at the same time lyrically it kind of speaks to this aware that what he's doing with his music is kind of obnoxious I think a barred from Burzum is another good example I mean he makes music that is you know it ideologically speaking you know berzins music is pretty in line with a lot of the things that he does it made learning such as killing people you know and does that mean that you know that music and really black metal in general can't be enjoyed I mean by any people who care about you know human rights and stuff I mean well I think that ultimately that's for an individual to decide you know how much should your philosophy influence the ways that you appreciate music Odd Future is another example of kids who rap about some pretty heinous shit sometimes but they're not necessarily doing it however they're very kind of cocky and jerkish and unapologetic about it and and to an extent I understand why they cave can sing about a very heinous disgusting act and it's sort of you know artful and accepted but when taya the creator or you know Earl or somebody like that raps about rape they're assumed a rapist you know and I think that that's unfair and probably kind of racist but at the same time the way that they've responded to certain allegations about you know that actually a lot of the negative opinions about the odd future members are not informed really by the lyrical content but more informed by the ways in which the people in the in the collective present themselves and you know how they act on Twitter and just the stupid things that they say occasionally you know that that's that to me constitutes obnoxious behavior and maybe even asshole behavior but not terrible person behavior another funny thing to mention is not only is this video going to last forever yeah but sometimes that asshole behavior despite the fact that people hate it and despise it and talk shit about it on the internet it in fact helps them a lot of the time I mean especially in the case of Odd Future especially in the case of you know J retard who around the time when you put out blood visions was not that well-known and then when that whole debacle went down where he punched that guy in the face through life Oh like any and every semi violent you know live video family serve like brought into context he was like made famous almost overnight and when I interviewed him we were talking about it he was telling me like you know literally like the next week you know just from all the blog posts tons of people were coming out to my shows and then you know the next two are like less people were there because they knew that when they came out next time there weren't going to be me punching people in the face and like people would come out to my show and like provoke me and just like trying to get me to punch them in the face and the thing is like all that I guess attention on him also got people listening to his music and knowing full well that he is this dude who punched this other dude in the face for you know reasons unknown to most of us because the video is so sure you know his music appeal to a lot of people because you know you had a lot of first-time listeners like who's this dude punching people in the face let me listen this is pretty catchy you know I'm gonna buy this record I'm gonna buy this record so so yes you know there are a lot of people who do asshole stuff in music there are a lot of people who just have asshole personalities in music but I mean in my opinion I don't feel like that necessarily means you have to hate their music you know it's just basically it for me it's true I mean I think that you know again when it comes down to is how the individuals you know personal beliefs and actions are expressed through their music I mean if the music itself you know promotes some sort of asshole message you know then it suffers for it in my opinion um I mean one example one last example that I was actually thinking about a lot within this past week I ended up seeing a punk band called Joyce Manor play at the space and this is my second time seeing them and I wrote in advance you know in advance of the second show about you know their music and the certain qualities of their music that I feel tend to attract you know kind of not his fans and just seem kind of obnoxious to me and you know lo and behold I went to the show and everyone was kind of obnoxious including including the singer of the bed but to his credit he was for the most part making fun of the kinds of people who were at the show but it was just so unbelievably like obnoxious I mean you know these kids I like you know moshing or whatever and they're doing their thing you know it's it's a normal Punk show and Barry from Joyce manners looks down at these kids and he goes oh so this is your first show and I was just like oh my god like it's covered jerk thing he sounds like he sounds like me like watching that happen but he's on stage and it's his band and it's his music and you know the band has some sort of responsibility for the kinds of people who come out to their shows some musicians you never really know they're assholes or have asshole personalities or tendencies until you see them live again what do you guys think assholes and music making asshole music doing asshole things um people are not assholes man singing that has whole things the whole King the caboodle what are your thoughts should it impact how you feel about records songs melodies lyrics should it in a good way in a bad way let me know Anthony Fantan out Chris cappella assholes souls forever 
5WlUMxDtLqY,Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd I look like a complete filthy mess right now and that's okay because my review is a complete mess because this this album is kind of a complete and utter mess but we're gonna get through it we're gonna get through it together the bank the bank the bank the band is block-party this is their latest full-length album for hopefully you already got that from the title these guys are a British rock quartet and this LP comes after a pretty interesting musical journey for the band which pretty much started off with the jolt of a debut album silent alarm came out in 2005 and the reception to this LP was as eruptive as the music itself people for the most part remember this album for it's very tight fast just exciting drums very smooth groovin bass lines sharp jagged guitar phrases tracks like helicopter positive tension like eating glass and even though people always mention those tracks all the time as some of their favorites from this LP mmm it usually gets neglected it usually gets neglected that there are a lot of nicer and slower jams on this LP as well it's not like block-party was constantly you know they had their tender moments which in my opinion were just as good as the harder moments on the LP you can't have a party it's it's late you'll wake up the neighbors all right I said the band's name like a minute ago so you're coming in late it's the name of the band I'm not saying we should have a block party you're stupid shut up um overall in my opinion this is definitely one of the most notable modern British rock records and silent alarm continues to haunt block party not because they keep trying to make the same album over again but because they keep trying to evolve the irony is that the band hit it big being a rock band but yeah they keep trying to experiment with with not being a rock band after their debut over and over again trying to incorporate the one thing rock fans hate the most electronics I mean that's pretty much like kryptonite to them I'm kidding I'm really really kidding but with black parties next full-length LP a weekend in the city they really tried to flesh their sound out with extra instrumentation with electronics since effects and really tried to rely on their balladry a little bit more don't get me wrong this is still a rock album at its core the band's very tight rock instrumentation is still in this LP it's just kind of melded with all these extra things this is definitely nowhere near as energetic or is jagged as Bloc party's debut and intentionally so the band really went for an overall smoother experience and it really kind of bit them in the butt with a lot of fans now the band's next LP intimacy is where things really shift they're really just kind of playing alternative dance music on nonsense some moments here there were some corny lyrics I was picking up here and there on some tracks but I really like how the band was incorporating some electronics into their into their sound there was a lot of strangeness and in dissonance on these tracks I liked that the band was being adventurous but I know this help he was not too well received welcome to the world of blowing up on your debut album and then trying to challenge uninvested fans with new directions now this new LP comes after a hiatus that the band kind of self imposed after the release of intimacy other projects were pursued breaks were taken maybe some good times were had and maybe that's the case because coming back into this record I really kind of feel like Bloc Party hippy reset button on things lo and behold the band has returned with a 100% unfettered unadulterated rock album but it's almost as if they've done it but grudgingly like hey we're going to make a rock album but we're going to do it our way let's do a bunch of skippy guitar edits and loops let's do huge monstrous alternative rock riffs let's throw some van go in there some strings do have handful of ballads some dance-punk drumbeats some straightforward just regular rock beats a few throw backs to the 90s so block party is definitely rocking again just not exactly in the same way that their first LP did and I think the final result is block parties least cohesive album yet in their entire discography this thing is just all over the place not too all over the place I just actually like to think of the music on this album as being exactly like the cover you have a series of different colors and and shapes coexisting so closely on one sort of set amount of space but nothing intersects nothing interacts it's all just kind of there running parallel to one another which is a bit of a surprise because even during block parties worst moments the band put together a pretty cohesive string of tracks here you're really kind of getting a mixed bag and I actually have to kind of interpret it as the band experimenting once again I don't think block party is a dumb band and this is definitely not their first rodeo I think it's as obvious to them as it is to you or me that a lot of these tracks are just kind of coming out of nowhere as usual the band is kind of pushing themselves outside of their comfort zone trying new things and it ends up giving them some interesting hybrids of styles just things that you would never expect from them based on their previous material okay so the LP opens up with so he begins to lie one of the tracks that to me taking more alternative rock approach with the heavy guitar riffs right from the get-go I think it's something Foo Fighters fans will really get into and it's a weird groove for block party block party is no stranger to grooves but this is definitely a different one for them the hook is really strong on this track the ruvé the riff is is well played and I like the ending to the track which is really what kind of won me over on this thing it's kind of a post rock climax finishing this thing off now other tracks on here kind of take this alternative rock approach and they can be kind of hit or miss the track Petaling is Grilli the catchiest of the alt-rock bunch on this entire album massive riffs that I gotta say remind me of Creed a little bit to an extent can you do not gonna finish singing that um but still in a good way in a good way the track Coliseum though oh not liking that at all it starts off with this faux bluesy guitar riff and like it's really bad high-pass filter on the lead vocals it's just a really cheesy way to intro a track and those riffs that just are so hard some of the fiercest riffs that come in right after that part I mean it's a shame that they saved all their ferocity for that one part after this terrible intro the last track on here we're not good people continues kind of that heavy all rock riffing and it just slays next I kind of want to talk about the track three times three which is kind of a weird thing it's like block-party taking on news or the mars volta the lead vocals on this track totally change up and just morph into this loud powerful just oh it really sent chills down my spine hearing the vocals on this track and I like how they can be so versatile you get this track where they're so powerful and just soaring over the music and then you get a track like truth they're kind of being sung in a whimper which put me off at first as being kind of wimpy but I mean the song the the instrumentation behind the song how it really kind of has a nice momentum behind it a really nice strong rock momentum but yet there is that melody in that vocal delivery that also makes it feel simultaneously like a ballad it was just a really nice mix of that sharp block-party instrumentation but some really nice sincere emotion to the two tracks octopus and team a really to me are kind of like classic block party except they do kind of have that stuttering repeating looping guitar chop and repeat effect going on it works so much better on octopus which has one of the stronger hooks on this entire LP team a I can really kind of take relieve you've got some ballots to the healing and a for I am kind of underwhelmed by to be completely honest but as far as real tacos I love the progression of that track I'm liking the vocal melody too there is just a nice point a point B change on that track you really get a sense of that you're moving through a well-developed piece of music and I guess the last track that I have to bring up is is valise which totally stuck out to me as being maybe the Poppaea song block party has ever written but still kind of maintaining I guess their integrity as you could call it while that hook to me seems like maybe the most radio-friendly hook I've ever heard from block party I don't really feel like they they chipped away at their usual musical style you know it still feels like a block party song overall I feel like the band is experimenting on this LP and as a result you do get some fun moments some catchy moments some exciting moments but also some missteps to some underwhelming moments as well despite the fact that I am saying that block party is experimenting on this LP I couldn't help but feel like there were a few tracks where they were just kind of like you know sitting back on where they felt comfortable oh we can push out a song like this pretty easy this is our usual thing still even a great deal the moments like that I thought thought thought thought went over really really well it's difficult for me to pick this album apart as a whole because I don't really think it was was was built with a holistic intention in mind I mean like I said it's kind of a mess it's all over the place but I did end up enjoying a majority of these songs for for what they were and what they were to me were good songs so we're at the end here really kind of feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing thought it was very enjoyable I mean I had a very good time listening to it it kind of wowed me at first and then as I listened to it more I was like mmm this kind of suspect but then as I listened to it more again then I just kind of reached this equilibrium and was like yeah yeah yeah I don't know if that's how a lot of you felt about this thing when you give it a listen but that's why I'm going to ask you right now let me know what you thought of this LP did you love it did you hurt it why and what the hell should I review next remember the good comment so if your good comment the great rate so if your great rate but only this is a strong subscribe

fSB9Wy0-Ps4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd just woke up just going to review this because reviews are my breakfast and this review is going to take a long hard look at the new while nothing LP Nocturne he is really practicing alright wild nothing is the musical project of singer-songwriter Joe Joe Joe Jack Tatum I reviewed his debut LP a few years ago and it was a thoroughly enjoyable record a really dreamy light soft indie pop and rock record some very jangly guitars almost everything in the mix a little wet with reverb it's not a sound I've exactly enjoyed as it's gotten popular I'm talking about acts like real estate or dive or beach fossils Lotus Plaza to an extent crap spells I haven't liked most of it not all of it most of it because a lot of the times stuff like this is is more aesthetic than anything once you have the guitars and vocals soaked and reverb to the point where they're blurred beyond recognition nothing else matters the songs can be boring the lyrics can be bad the vocal delivery can be really apathetic to an extent even wild nothing's debut suffered from some of these issues what I did enjoy about the album is that throughout it had some pretty sweet catchy melodies some nice song structures and a lot of variation across the tracks and that is what is sort of making me want to revisit and see what they're doing next despite not being the biggest advocate of this style and I'm glad I did because the thing is to me this record is a nice improvement over Gemini I'm going to use the M word they've definitely to word the playing is better the recording is better there's extra instrumentation that pops up on some of the tracks especially like the first track that has a nice string section on it the sounds are more lush more vast the singing is is way more engaging the song shadow has a very strong thematic melody a driving snare drum a breezy vocal delivery that seductively hits every note Jack Tatum when he's singing on this record I didn't really get this vibe on a last record on this record he has this kind of throaty whisper equality to it is singing it actually kind of reminds me of Billy Corrigan a little bit in a sense especially when I'm hearing the strings in the song definitely hearing that melancholy kind of vibe on on this LP it's pop it's rock but it's also refined and very moody I'm really liking the second track on the LP to midnight song I love that chord progression on the chorus a lot of a melody very strong dreamy melody coming out of that portion of the track even a few tracks kick it off with some very fiery kind of guitar leads Nocturne disappear always and it just adds to that strong sense of melody that permeates every single song of course there's a head swing rocker on this thing only Heather which is fast it is catchy I did think the lyrics were a bit corny though however I do like that hook only Heather the track Paradise has some very glossy synthesizers a new wave beat kind of a delivery that I would liken to craft spells or new order of course I'm really liking these semi deadpan vocals on that one that rhythm guitar is awesome to a man it been babied and the vintage synth tones as well good stuff just a lot of light dreamy grooves and and good songs together at last even when I'm not particularly smitten with a groove on this track like through the grass or this chain I do find other things about the song that I think are appealing I just think there are a lot of things to admire about this record it is just a beautifully painted portrait consisting mostly of just pastel colors pastel a lot of well-developed melodies hear the occasional cheesy synthesizer circa 1985 but kind of repurposed it's just kind of one dreamy hit after another if I do hold any issues with this LP I do tend to be more of a fan of I guess bolder music louder music music that just has stronger darker or brighter colors and you are kind of sacrificing that when you choose to make dreamy rock or pop such as this that led to a lot of moments I thought were kind of forgettable when I was first listening to this but there were enough tracks that I thought were just catchy upon first listened that kept me returning to this until the point where I really kind of got those more subtle tracks there was never really no point on this LP where I was like man what were they thinking and despite the fact that this is a very quiet album boredom was very very far away in my mind I am pretty much feeling a light eight on this LP enjoyed a lot if you guys have listened to it what do you think did you love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantan oh wild nothing Nocturne oh and remember the good comment the great rate the strong subscribe forever [Music] you 
DUIEepOLRYY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd doing the fourth part of my series of videos going through my vinyl collection in alphabetical order right now nobody is manning the camera no one is manning the camera it's just solo mio amico that's not even Spanish these are raw by the way not editing these alright I believe we left off on Buzzcocks in the last video below this video I'm going to link to all of my other vinyl videos just gonna talk straight for about 10 minutes without whatever records we can get through sort of talking to talk about records that have a special significance to me or some interesting packaging let's see we're in the seas we are just breaking into the Seas right now we have John Cale's vintage violence on Columbia Records his debut solo album after a you know content starting to make music after leaving The Velvet Underground where he's not being in The Velvet Underground anymore now anything amazing to say about the packaging nice you know record pressing it is a reissue you know it's not original pressing unfortunately why do you guys freak down because uh I put my records down here well it is clean down here I'm not a pig I don't have a messy floor I have a cleaned off spot you know he is not a vinyl person he's licking the records he's holding them the wrong way like my hands are clean I wash my hands before I start fingering my vinyl so you know don't start crying um Connecticut band called arson classic in the Connecticut scene check these guys out you know this is this is a reissue of this album I believe this is the first time it's on vinyl I could totally be wrong I think I'm right this is out of via the record store red scroll records they've been issuing records lately and you know look them up look at my uh call it arson definitely an important record when it comes to modern [Music] local Connecticut music okay continuing on her as I take down my entire record showing Oh classic classic love this record on my favorite country records freakin love this album if you're like hey I really want to get into country music I really want to get into Johnny Cash BAM Folsom Prison this is a masterful record I know it's hard to think like really a live album is the first album I should try from an artist but in this case yes nothing amazing about the packaging but you know you do get this a letter from Johnny Cash on the back kind of a explaining the situation and everything with this album great LP amazing LP The Clash give them enough rope the album they put out after their full-length debut um my other clash stuff is on CD pretty much everything else I have from the clash is on CD this is my only piece of glass vinyl unfortunately but this is a great LP and some of my favorite clash songs on it including let's see English Civil War mmm tommy gun is on here freaking look Tom don't think I can sing that song or I might get sued or get this video taken down don't want to do either clues dang Clues Alden Penner gave this who gave this record a very positive review when it came out definitely one of my favorite records of that year if you're into the unicorns you want to hear unicorn side project other than Islands this is definitely worth checking out and it's funny if you're Ari unicorns fan my copy of their record who will cut our hair when you wear when we're gone is hanging on the wall in a frame the vinyl copy of but you know if you are unicorns fan and you have heard Islands definitely check this out because this record definitely kind of gives you a sense of what Nick would bring to that record the the unicorns record and when Alden would bring to it and it's sort of you're seeing his creative side in the raw on this LP that's not just the only reason I love it I think the songwriting is great I think it's very colorful it's a very fun record lots of personality lots of character interesting melodies and and song structures he really screws with song structure you guys probably know this record comic game gave this a pretty positive review nothing huge to say about the packaging other than that it is just a really solid you know indie indie rock and indie pop record alright this what you were looking at here is the first record I have ever owned this is my first piece of vinyl still got it The Cramps live rocking and reeling in Auckland New Zealand I am a Cramps fan and this unfortunately is not a original depressing does have a lot of great live cuts on it and I like how the band kind of segues from one track into another for a good part of this LP partially because a lot of the crêpes songs in terms of drum beats or bass lines would kind of sound the same it's kind of easy to segue but a hot pearl snatch people ain't no good what's inside a girl sunglasses after dark heartbreak I got a listen to this I gotta listen to this again can you do the dog I gotta listen to this again but anyway the reissues that vengeance did with these LP with these LPS a bunch of Cramps albums are great great they got the colored vinyl in there they got the nice the nice printing they got the nice label they got the great colorful orange sleeve I also have a date with Elvis actually at like three other Cramps records that were on vengeance from that reissue but I ended up selling them I didn't like him as much as is this stuff in there earlier stuff like look mom no hand and that stuff John Coltrane Giant Steps not anything amazing about the packaging other than that it is a great thick record-pressing atlantic but uh you know this is this is definitely an essential listen if you're looking to get into bobbin and stuff like that you're looking to getting some really hard improvisational you know modern not modern today but you know past that big band era of jazz you're looking for something hard and fast and just colorful and and and and really fun to listen to in that trio quartet quintet style of jazz that was very prominent in the in the 60s 70s of course I have a John Coltrane live at the Village Vanguard me and my fall droogs and that LP I just want to say for you people who are interested in jazz and are curious about jazz this is on impulse impulse put out a lot of fantastic jazz records back in the day I mean if you're looking for jazz records and you're just curious I mean you know you don't necessarily need to be like oh what artists do I need to get into you know look for impulse look up the impulse label look up their discography pretty much everything they put out in terms of jazz especially in the 60s is just mint mint stuff Creedence got some credence Green River this one was owned by Ron Ron wrote his name on that lot of classics on this thing Green River is on here I wrote the song for everyone bad moon rising of course number one hit it's kind of scratched on the back you know when you when you get these older LPS that were you know other people own when they were kids you tend to get labels and names written on them if you get them secondhand fantasy I know the record is pretty clean though a friend of mine of my friend Derek who kind of got me into vinyl got me that one gave me that record he gave me these are these records as well to Creedence Clearwater compilations all the hits on here all its you know I keep them around for the the CCR man where's the tape in the tape in there they got the Creedence tape awesome Dan Deacon spider-man of the Rings I bought this at other music in New York that's right I remember that not just other music I really loved crystal cat still love that song Wham City is great too unfortunately I did not like the record you put out that after this one just did not like that record at all you know I'm hope hopefully you know you heard it here first hopefully I'm gonna enjoy his new record but uh you know I but but this album to me is just the the best you know that I've heard from him so far I do like that weird gatefold that he's got going there okie-dokie on here trippy green skull what what snake snake mistakes there's a fun song to the Dead Milkmen eat your Paisley nice nice now actually not one of my favorite did milkman Records who but there are some good beach party Vietnam is on here let me see the thing that only eats hippies look up the Dead Milkmen they are a punk band that broke so many rules they were just so tongue-in-cheek they were just so funny a lot of weird just satirical songs look at this long bitchin Camaro look up bitchin Camaro never heard of the Dead Milkmen look up bitchin Camaro you'll laugh your ass off hmm getting into the DS here getting into these DS I think think you guys know about it's time to stop that's it so for the final video right now next video I will be talking a little about the Death Grips and uh and yeah that's it love you Anthony Fantino vinyl [Music] 
aAK0fVxfOUU,hmm hi everyone Anthony Fantan out here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review devotion from Jessie where oh she's there right there and the Wow really she's over here even on your wall it's not funny Jessie where is an up-and-coming pop singer from the UK this her debut full-length LP my first exposure to her was singing on that subtract album last year that I loved that I thought was so great she had a vocal appearance on just one single track then I started hearing singles and and promotional tracks from the cell P kind of building up to the release of the album I ran into 110 percent which has this future garage style vocal sampling this twittering busy rhythm some smooth vocals and synthesizers it has a really bouncy rich bassline - I didn't really feel like it was a gripping tune with how it was delivered it was kind of quiet throughout not really many climaxes you know I'm totally for the breaking just the snapping of traditional song structures or just adding on them and experimenting with them but this to me just feels like no structure but another single from this LP I love wildest moments the B is so epic the presentation of the song period is is pretty grandiose and I like the lyrics on the song too about this couple putting all this effort in sort of making this relationship work but these two people in the relationship have a full understanding of what the potential for this relationship could be that is what keeps them going the verse and the chorus have two very distinct feels to them really dynamic song the chorus segues into a beautiful refrain we can be the greatest we can be the great and I love how you get that dark choral effect when Jessie Ware's sings or we can be the worst of all just kind of adding that that Moody to that section of the lyrics because while these people in this relationship keep going because they know that potential of how great this thing could be they also know that it can be pretty terrible as well another track that was put out before this LP sweet talk is another great pop tune but it has a bit of vintage feel to a kind of a retro futuristic going back to the 80s with the drumbeat and with the synthesizers and with the guitar leads that kind of interject between lyrics I like the way the instrumentation changes on the second verse maybe the hook could be a little bit bigger maybe the vocals bite a bit from little dragon but sweet talk and wildest moments are like everything I look for in a pop song this album is titled devotion and if it is devoted to anything it is the warm and smooth soul vibes of artists like Janet Jackson Whitney Houston Billy ocean Patrice Rushen all those names rhymed I think Jesse where definitely takes influence from those artists but has a much kind of killer vibe to her music even though I thought the singles to this LP were a little a little hit or miss I was still pretty excited for this thing thought it would bring some big things I would get a very classy kind of pop record however I feel like once I delved into this thing from beginning to end all these small issues that I had on a couple of the singles just really got amplified throughout this thing there are a lot of very underwhelming moments lack of climaxes and and when Jesse where does manage to adventure a little bit it can be a kind of bad experiment like the first track on here the title track it's just not a good opener you've got these twinkling synthesizers and and Jesse is is vocalizing with some kind of forgettable lyrics over this groove it starts off okay but there's not really any kind of change or significant progression and the bass line on this thing is terrible as far as I can tell the track is in the key of D and and thing is pretty much in a major scale except for the baseline which is playing D and then kind of sliding down to a second note which if it were going to be in the D major scale it would be a diminished sixth but nothing else in the instrumentation seems to be hinting toward playing or referencing that diminished six so it's kind of dissonant for no real reason there are more tracks on here that have grooves that are better than the opener but they two also kind of lack anything interesting in terms of progression and what hurts them even more is that the lyrics here and there can be pretty amateur or monotonous I feel like you definitely could make the case that this is a sophisticated pop record this pop record has a very expensive dress on it sips wine delicately it's not bubblegum by any means whatsoever but despite the sophistication I actually think most of this album is underdeveloped and pretty weakly improvised thankfully toward the middle of the LP another solid pop track with a structure comes out to play nightlight though the hook is pretty big I like the strings on the song - nice production the lyrics can be so cheesy that it's a song I kind of hate to love though much of this album is very chill very fragile and relaxed the ending tracks seem to get even quieter and and sadly to me it only adds up to even more underwhelming moments overall for me devotion is is really really spotty it puts forth an image and an attitude that would make you think that the album is more progressive than it really is I am totally down for embracing the past but Jessie ware doesn't really do anything new with it or adventurous with it and I don't think she's put forth the effort to avoid the pitfalls that kind of come with this style of music - the majority of these tracks are heavily pulling from the kinds of R&B records that right now are gathering dust in bins in thrift stores across America I can see why this album would appeal to other people more than me but I didn't like I mean I'm pretty much sticking to the singles on this thing and and that's where my enjoyment of this album really kind of stops in a big way I'm feeling a decent too strong for on this thing but what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next remember the good comment the great rape but only the strong subscribe Jessie we're devotion forever 
JoewSimddUg,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review eeprom metahuman this guy is a Portland music producer from what I understand this is his debut full-length LP album right now with with styles of electronic music like dubstep future garage footwork glitch hop wonky electronic music is really at the forefront of a lot of new and creative sounds right now and even though EPROM is not one of the bigger names in electronic music right now I think he's digging for new and interesting ideas with the best of them me his new album metahuman and this is such a headphone album not a phrase I use much to describe albums only when it's necessary usually I like to listen to stuff on the hi-fi on the speakers but not the case with this thing though this album's tracks do have a pretty bold and colorful attitude that you will find with most beat music producers of the glitch hop variety he Proms aesthetic is very quiet it's very subtle it's like a very calming party happening between your ears and what I love about this dude is is how he treats sound on some of these songs he just shoots for a lot of synthetic textures on this thing it sounds like he is treating and manipulating many of these sounds very very minimally not a lot of distortion not a ton of reverb he really likes to maintain that juicy lush very electronic vibe there sounds on here that are of an 8-bit quality there are a lot of rhythm sounds to me that sound akin to a lot of those snare and kick hits that you would usually hear coming out of an 808 but EPROM finds ways to kind of sequence these sounds really interestingly the opening tractor's has these plinking little tap and clicks that are kind of rolling they're kind of stuttering they're just skittering some of them are closed and very claustrophobic on the ear some of them are pretty distant in a very panoramic kind of way it's like a it's like turning a rain stick over the introduction on this track is like gently flicking microscopic water droplets at my ears then all of a sudden this bass II beat comes in it's really spacious there are a few bouncy echoes here and there maybe like a higher low-pass filter on something to kind of give it a low Phi aesthetic and the groove on the track is is interesting because it feels so kind of robotic and sterile usually something that would turn me off but I feel like it helps the track in this case because it brings a really unique flavor to the song this track really becomes a half human half robot incarnate there's something very strange about this track there's something very serious about it very Stern about it but you also have to keep in mind that there are bangers that come after this track there are bouncier and just harder hitting songs to a degree that come after this track this guy is definitely not making electronic music to bore you he wants it to sound like a good time but kind of a quiet good time like the track prototype and even though this track does have one of the heavier beats on the album EPROM is not about instant gratification the track opens up with an eerie synth drum with just so many layers just a casserole of synthesizer and it's so thick it's so beautiful then these arpeggiated riffs kind of come in and then just starts mmm denne denne denne denne denne denne denne antennae it's a great groove it's just a really kind of dark vibe and I like how he continues to kind of walk this weird tightrope or just kind of meet at this strange crossroads where the track is kind of loud but also very soft very kind of bare and skeletal the track can control after that feels even more skeletal it's like a dancehall track that would go over well in purgatory however around the sixth track for this thing this album kind of just jumped ship from the weird odd and somewhat unique world it had been building with the first portion of this album EEPROM starts bringing in these 8-bit synthesizers which make things a little bit brighter and I feel like I would like the sixth track that this starts on a bit more if the beat wasn't so plainly sequenced I get that this guy wants to bring some musical variety some stylistic variety to this album but I don't think every change adds up to a phenomenal track the track transparency has some subtle dubstep influences and the synthesizers and in the vocal samples but it's not really that memorable of a moment on the LP for me neither is the song variations which is kind of what the title says it is a variation on a phrase on an idea kind of bring it through different phases this parts hitting hard with a beat this part is the same musical phrase but it kind of sounds like it's being performed with the Spanish guitar that track kind of wears it to welcome for me really fast and the song right after that love number is just unashamed Flying Lotus worship and not even really like the best Flying Lotus worship I've ever heard the last portion of the album starts getting a little bit noisier a bit glitchy err and I like that this album starts strong it ends relatively strong but there is that kind of dry spot in the middle for me this dude has some serious chops too the way he puts tracks together even if at times the sounds themselves can seem pretty bare pretty rudimentary and just simple on the surface he can really create some unique atmospheres especially on the first portion of this LP but once he started to try on other things that's when this helped he really started to lose momentum for me but if you're looking for an electronic music album that just brings together like I said very quietly elements of dubstep music of glitch hop just some weird instrumentals for you beat heads then this is definitely something worth checking out yeah yeah I think beats you do yes you make beats yeah you make beats yes sir you make beats ah then show me those beats re a decent set forever 
cJ5TedT9ZNA,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review jay-j doom OMF doom your verses always make my heart's wound here beads they make my speakers go BOOM yes they always make them go BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM [Music] I'm feeling that swag wrong JJ doom is the collaborative effort of MC MF doom aka doom all capitals and Janeiro jor-el this is their first full-length LP together and let me put this into context for you doom is easily the most infamous underground MC n producer of the very late 90s and early to mid 2000s on song after song after song he just uses this very low monotonous flow to spit these very abstract oddball rhymes with references so strange and esoteric that they'll make your head spin and on numerous albums of his he's always throwing out very weird cartoony sometimes apocalyptic and tortured song concepts but no matter how out there doom make it with a song there's usually some kind of underlying sense of humor there you can always kind of have a chuckle at something he's saying and I'm not trying to say that he can't be taken seriously I'm just saying that no matter how clever or poignant something he says is there's usually some kind of goof just around the corner like steady losing momentum Oh eat a rapper one a day like syndrome all these things make doom likable the comedy just the the gritty flow his song topics his very shady lyrics and and the kind of gimmick he's got going with his mask which maintains the anonymity of his character or people for the most part know who he is and what he was affiliated with before he started the whole MF DOOM get up but he continues to perform as this character because he likes the image now MF DOOM in my opinion has had his share of great solo LPS operation doomsday food borne like this but some of his most popular albums have been collaborations with with other artists for example the danger doom LP he did with Danger Mouse and of course is his most celebrated release of all time I'm sure you already know it mad villainy which is the album he did with of course him on lyrics and Madlib handling the production side of things daddy loves these days doom has not really been working up to the prolific very prolific level that he was putting albums out at during his 2003-2004 period and in the meantime he hasn't been doing a lot of new production I mean that new maps to a cell P is pretty much old MF DOOM beats for the most part and he hasn't been doing a lot of features on other people's tracks to kind of keep his image his character his style in the ever-evolving consciousness of what's now the modern underground hip-hop playing field still his subtle influence remains on a lot of the artists that people are listening to right now the up-and-comers people from Odd Future bike this dude's flow in his style all the time even on some of their earliest mixtapes they're taking MF DOOM beats Joey badass uses MF DOOM production on his new mixtape and bites a little bit of his flow too on a track and I think that part of the reason artists like dass racist and Danny Brown are so widely accepted is partially because MF DOOM is very crackpot humor built up to what they're doing this year MF DOOM is coming forward with this new project he is on lyrical detail Gennaro jor-el is handling the production side of things and to start with the production I really have to compliment JJ on this thing he did a great job on most these instrumentals not only are they just dark and kind of low fie but they've got a lot of detail in them too they've got some nice grooves and I think what's best about his production is that it really kind of lives up to dooms reputation and he is an artist whose reputation you cannot ignore when you are producing a group of instrumentals for an album he's going to put out of course you want to kind of conform to his style a bit give him a proper setting but you want to leave your own mark on this project as well and kind of sidestep the constant Madlib comparisons that this album is is definitely going to get and JJ did put doom on some interesting sounds that you wouldn't normally hear him on like the track banished and the two songs after have a lot of sense or just bouncier brighter sense than you would normally hear on a doom production and I feel like the beats on on this thing overall are bit down seer then you would usually expect from a doom project the track GMO has a melody in the instrumental that sort of seems familiar to me like I've heard it somewhere on another doom album but to hear him over an acoustic guitar and some really nice sweet strings was was pretty awesome the track winter blues either has some very beautiful sense or very beautiful strings on I can't quite figure out but it's a very faint atmospheric tone that that just in cases dooms lyrics and the last song on here is kind of a bit of a piece of satire that I'll get into later but the B sounds kind of like a club beat and of course hearing doom over something like this is a surprise but given the lyrics the lyrical content it really kind of fits nicely if I have any issues with the instrumentals at all from time to time they can kind of feel like JJ is playing toward expectations though this LP is well produced on first listen especially its kind of difficult to pick up things sonically that make this album feel exciting or new or different for doom because some instrumentals on here feel like they could appear on just about any other doom album like governor or the sound collage introduction that kind of kicks the LP off but over I do like the instrumentals on here they have a very kind of dark character to them they all sound like they were kind of hammered out in an old MPC and recorded straight to cassette tape and then brought straight to the studio another thing that that kind of subtly separates this project from other doom projects are the features Damon Albarn has a very kind of quiet vocal contribution on a track Beth Gibbons of portishead has a beautifully eerie vocal contribution on the track GMO she's great on that song adds a lot to it and there are three other tracks on here where there's actually no doom whatsoever and the vocal guest is kind of just taking up the entirety of the song JJ is on a track which is pretty decent he spits a line where he says he's tired of these wack cats so he's become dog friendly you've got Boston fielder singing on a track on here as well and I don't know I didn't care for his voice like the first couple bars on this song are pretty shaky it gets a little better when he starts throwing multi-tracked harmonies into the song but the track just has a bad start in terms of just being on pitch and another rapper comes on here Cujo goody whoo-hoo I'm actually pretty unfamiliar with um the instrumental he spits on is is pretty short his verse is short as well and he doesn't really say all that much that's that's memorable on the track and there's kind of a lazily applied echo effect on on his voice as well that I didn't really get I can't help but feel like these tracks especially are just kind of trying to kill time on this LP there are 15 tracks on key to the cuffs but you're pretty much only hearing doom rap on 9 and these tracks pretty much all last from about one to three minutes but you're not really even hearing him rap for the entirety of the track if there's an intro or the instrumental changes up at the end or there's some kind of sound collage that finishes off the song and despite some of his brags on these tracks I can't help but feel like a handful the songs on this thing are underwhelming and he throws out some pretty cringe-worthy lines like we'll see the style is still clad y'all need to practice like you need some real bad the freeform tracks can be kind of spotty there are some freeform tracks on here that are great the track banish'd is great though and has doom wrapping pretty fast and the rework of the song retarded friend is is great as well what happens when the pole shift it won't matter for who you roll with cold and stiff hold it if ooh and I think the topical tracks on here are even better the song GMO has doom rapping about these these very kind of nightmarish mutations that occur due to genetically modified food the track winter blues like I said with the instrumental has a very beautiful setting but the lyrics over that are very sincere and tender and kind of feel like a love song maybe more figurative than literal though it's an interesting track and one of the few that really moved me on this thing and the track wash your hands is the clothes around here and it's absolutely hilarious and in a kind of gross sort of way doom lyrically paints this picture of like a strip club and the the strippers have bacteria on them and sewed of the people who are going they're not washing their hands when they get out of the bathroom at the bar it's it's pretty disgusting there are points on this thing that I like I do feel like most of the track where it's just doom straight spinning on a great instrumental no hook just his usual delivery is pretty great I just wish like I said there were some surprises on here and if I'm not going to get any surprises I feel like doom could have fixed what I'm sure is going to be the greatest disappointment for most people on this album and that is you don't really get a lot of face time with him for lack of a better phrase this LP is 42 minutes but it feels so much shorter because a good chunk of it is not doom rapping so not only is this LP kind of disjointed but it really is sort of snack-sized for me I wish there were more topical tracks on here I wish there were more tracks on here where I felt like doom was going at these instrumentals with just a bit more aggression and that's what's really kind of keeping me from liking this album a lot didn't really come out hating this thing I do like it a bit but I would not recommend it for first-timers and if you are first-timer and you do happen to like it I mean his previous stuff to me just so much more when I really am feeling like a light to decent six on this LP what did you guys think of it if you've given it a listen love it hate it why let me know remember the good comment the great rate but only the strong subscribe Anthony Fantana JJ doom forever [Music] 
fD4X1_Tvlig,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here intranets busiest music nerd here to do a question comment thing over the past few weeks a lot of you may have been paying attention to the developing story involving the female the Russian female punk trio known as Pussy Riot they've been on trial in Russia for hooliganism and basically what they did is they went to the Russian Orthodox Church to kind of do an impromptu performance of a song that they had written and now they've basically gone through the whole trial process and had been found guilty and are now going to be sitting in prison for two years a lot of people from the first world have expressed just how much of an overkill this sentence has been but the band was able to offer some pretty awesome closing statements in regards to why they did this the trial their philosophy as well and really exposed this is not just being some kind of childish juvenile prank which some people have kind of labeled it as being I will throw some links below where you yourself can read the closing statements offered by the band and a lot of the motivation behind choosing the Russian Orthodox Church as just sort of a place to stage this protest is that it's kind of become a tool for politicians in that country to gain favor with the populace sounds familiar but out of all the things that the band has said about their philosophy and just their reasons for doing this in the trial I thought that this quote right here is the most interesting out of all of them in this closing statement I would like to describe my first-hand experience of running afoul of this system our school which is where the personality begins to form in a social context a person's personality forms in a social context in school any particularity of the individual are ignored there is no individual approach no study of culture of philosophy of basic knowledge about civic society officially these subjects do exist but they are still taught according to the Soviet model and as a result we see the marginalization of contemporary art in the public consciousness a lack of motivation for philosophical thought and gender stereotyping the concept of the human being as a citizen its swept away into a distant corner today's educational institutions teach people from childhood to live as automatons not to pose the crucial questions consistent with their age they inculcate cruelty and intolerance of nonconformity beginning in childhood we forget our freedom really like this is what's motivating them we have those issues here this is absolutely depressing this is real actual rebellion this is the power music in half when you're actually standing for something putting music in a place where it shouldn't be and actually giving it a message that has some potency to it some importance to it I love that these girls have not only used music and used what they feel is their art to not only fight against a regime with this level of oppressive niss but they are also ready to come forward and fight for issues that most of the first world is yet to even resolve the moral of the story is always think for yourself think critically think critically of me think critically of anything and everything you read think critically of other people who tell you what to think other people who are in control of things think critically do everything you can in your power to maintain your ability to express how you feel and what you think use this situation to put what your situation is into context come into realization that wow I can actually say things about X Y & Z I admire these girls for having something to say and having a reason to say it I hope that the next two years are not too hard on them and that they're able to come back better than ever and though I think some people could again call what they did juvenile I don't think you could deny that it was an all-out success that they were basically able to tarnish the public image of the regime that they were funny against by going through this trial and basically allowing the entire world to see yeah look at how they're overacting to a bunch of masked girls jumping around and playing punk tunes in an Orthodox Church I'm going to leave links to statements that the band has made in relation to this trial down below underneath this video Rita Rita Rita three times take in what they're saying and again put into context where they are and what they're dealing with and where you are and when you're dealing with there are some things that are the same in terms of the problems they're suffering from and the problems that you are but there are some advantages that you also need to realize that you have and and you should take advantage of them it's all I'm saying so that's it Anthony Fantana Pussy Riot forever 
W45ddJvxOUY,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd trying out a new camera angle let me know what you think about it leave comment the Internet's most visibly sweaty music nerd and it's time for you review the band Shabab ah easily the most badass band name I've ever said on this channel Shiva thank you you you you this band's name comes from Mayan folklore and translates roughly into place of fear which was supposed to be inhabited by about 12 gods who lord it over various causes of human suffering death sickness starvation and more and to make things even more morbid this band's new LP their first album for the southern Lorde label has the title hasta la muerte which is to the death in Spanish these guys are aggressive as hell they're brutal as hell and they just deliver this building crumbling heaviness on track after track their earlier material did have a really aggressive energy but I think they really went above and beyond on this new LP really kind of bringing that hardcore punk ferocity with a sludge metal heaviness with the brand of low end that is very deserving of a spot in the southern Lord discography now southern lord has been carrying a lot of sludgy hardcore punk hybrids I have reviewed a handful of them a few of my most recent favorites have been black breath as well as the band males and Taylor young from nails Ashley does production on this LP and Greg Anderson of Sun comes in and contributes droney heavy loud guitars on a couple tracks too and the special attention that these guys have gotten this LP is really paid off because this album is so loud you cannot turn it down there are only two speeds at which you can go deaf to this LP fast and sort of fast so yes these guys are incredibly brutal and this extra attention that I just mentioned has brought a bit of detail character and finesse to the very blood-thirsty sound you do get this very heavy low-end sludge and doom Rivage mixed with that Punk speed but these guys also have the tendency to embark on these massive metalcore and beat down hardcore style breakdowns as well which I kind of have a love/hate relationship with I'm from Connecticut where we had a pretty thriving hardcore and in metalcore scene about ten years ago bands like hatebreed were pretty much spearheading that sound for the area and if you couldn't see Hatebreed live there were definitely a number of local acts who were kind of emulating their sound so when I was a teenager I was kind of around people that listened to that I liked it too however when I got older I kind of realized how shallow and redundant those genres can be but if you are you know interested in them curious I would definitely recommend Hatebreed or terror terror so again should ball but heavenly hands don't do that so the band definitely has that style of aggression and I find a lot of their tracks on this LP to be pretty dynamic the aggression complements the experimentation and vice versa you have the drones you have the long strung out dumi riffs and some noise as well on here that kind of keeps things very dark and very tortured but those very fast and hard and and aggressive riffs and breakdowns keep things from getting too long-winded too boring too drawn-out this LP opens up with a very dark drones and nice rich textures and some very caveman like prehistoric drums cavernous reverb on them and Greg Anderson isn't even on this track it's nice to know that this band can kind of create those sounds pretty well on their own really kind of create a massive atmosphere but right after this short atmospheric intro they bust right into the quickness with kind of a variation on a DB and then from there on in on the track it is just mosh mosh mosh mosh mosh the bass is so heavy they're not humble when it comes to the rumble especially when they lay on those breakdown riffs and back them up with some harmonious guitar leads it's kind of a rough quality to them that reminds me a lot of that freaking dyzma album that I liked so much last year after that the track laid to rest has a really nice mosh worthy groove and so does the song burn I mean just really great riffs adrenaline pumping my only issue with the handful of tracks on the first half of this LP even though they do come out swinging there are some spots that do feel a little you know inconspicuous hey I know this is really heavy and massive but I could kind of hear this riff or just something like it just about anywhere the second half on here I thought was way more experimental and sound rich the track flood is the first one that Greg Anderson appears on and it escalates just statically it starts off really loud and just he and cheb Alba work on making the sound one shade louder as it progresses and I'm just like man how much louder can they make it oh wow it's louder now how much louder can they make it oh man it's louder now how much louder can they make it the title track has a really long moody intro and I think it's catchy a song on the album has a really memorable hook and the entirety of the lyrics are in Spanish the song ma la mujer is a track that was a little off-putting as a female vocalist on it whose voice is manipulated with effects in a way that I didn't really care for though it was a nice addition to the album kind of broke things up brought some variation and the lyrics which are in English are very much about heartbreak and just suffering and in pain in relation to love or the lack of it coming from someone you want it from and the last two tracks on here are the longest on the album Greg Anderson is on the last one and they are droney and riffey odyssey's really two of the more interesting spots on the album I thought I would love to see Chabal be' experiment with this more even blend of this hardcore and drone and doom sound on their next LP for sure like I said with this LP there are some inconspicuous spots if you're familiar with this genre some things are just gonna feel maybe a little too familiar for you and the vocals which are really abrasive and really in your face just engulfing the microphone with volume and just thrown yet I wish they varied up a little bit more but there's enough change to them in the background vocals throughout this LP to you know not make them feel annoyingly one-sided and Shabab but definitely does a great job of bringing some some amazing aggression together with it with another level of heaviness I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this thing what did you guys think of this if you've given it a listen did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next remember the good comment the great rate but only the strong subscribed Anthony Fantino cheb Alba I said I'm where day forever [Music] [Music] 
UShpz0i0k8w,hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you review 2 Chainz based on a true story this guy is a Georgia rapper this is his full-length official label released debut and it is pretty much comprised of a group of songs that cover all the bases from southern hip hop to gangsta rap pop rap and trap rap as well now this guy has been making waves with some pretty big features lately he is rapped on tracks with Drake and Big KRIT kanye he had a verse on a Justin Bieber track too recently I believe but that's just lately the dude is easily done over a hundred features on on albums and mixtapes over the years two chains has essentially made it by being everywhere just kind of saturating the southern market with his verses he also has a good ear for just very trunk knocking beats and a knack for rapping kind of ear worm hooks a dude with those qualities is going to make money and a label like Def Jam and an artist like Kanye of course is going to see him and just see dollar signs so that is pretty much all I had for the backdrop on this guy um any questions Hey any questions over here ah cow um why is his name tool chains he doesn't have three um no I'm sure he has more than the two chains uh from what I understand he had to kind of change his name from something else also he said his name was one chain no no the name was a titty boy that's a bad name to Chiang overall I'm based on a true story you're pretty much not going to get anything you're not already familiar with if you have listened to a few popular hip-hip-hip a pop albums of the southern style and I don't really see how two chains is doing it all that differently or how his approaches is unique a guy like Rick Ross definitely has the more glamorous side of things covered Gucci Mane and Waka Flocka can do the dirty trap thing much more authentically if I have to kind of pigeon-holed 2 Chainz into anything he just kind of puts out a lot of little Wayne quality punchlines and narcissistic anecdotes with a much less distinct voice he knows that his verses are dumber than rocks and I feel like he knows that because he never really tries to make anything he says all too meaningful or deep or emotional which can really ruin an album if you actually don't have anything significant to say now I do you think hip hop of this style and 2 Chainz in general can be entertaining especially with his ridiculous delivery the occasional stumble in his flow or just sound effect with his mouth and of course his punchlines which can be so bad and so corny sometimes that becomes hilarious what 2 Chainz does lyrically on this album is is pretty basic it's it's pretty shallow I mean if you're listening to this thing and really analyzing his lyrics and and pulling them apart for deeper meanings you really got to reassess some priorities because this is nothing more than the hip hop that is more about the beat than it is the emcee it's more about the repetitious hook than it is about a real statement it's more about the shortsighted lyrical jabs than it is about anything long term or quotable and as long as we're talking quotes I've quoted some of what I think are the worst lines on this album down there in the D box so yeah I know that being ultra lyrical isn't the point 2 Chainz album I get the joke my problem is that the joke gets old it gets so old so fast 2 Chainz could easily be swapped out with any number of rappers that are spinning about the same kind of crap app don't act like we don't already understand that the mainstream rap game is pretty much just a revolving door of hip-hop artists who get hot and then cool off after making one or two albums some find a niche and grow others don't and I don't really see 2 Chainz finding his niche on this thing it starts off with a really underwhelming just boring intro with little Wayne the B is just too flowery to really kick anything off the tracks 2 through 5 with with no lie and then birthday song and crack are all bangers just really catchy really just impactful some of the best songs on the album I thought despite the lyrical you know badness the album cools down with the track different over this beat that kind of reminds me of something that the yin-yang twins would have spit over back in the day but you know 2 Chainz lyrics were kind of ridiculous over the song and the fact that beat was cooler made me actually focus on them and that was a no-no after that comes a slow jam then I love them strippers with Nicki Minaj on a verse and miraculously despite the hook and the title of the song the track is not really even about strippers and Nicki Minaj's verse on that track terrible I don't know what's worse not getting the little engine that could reference at the end of her verse getting it and actually thinking it's clever or Nicki Minaj clarifying it after the song was over as if it was so important that it need to be said again there's a nice soulful instrumental that comes on the track stop me now that I liked a lot and after that comes another banger with money machine but thing is as this LP draws on all the better tracks are those bangers those tracks with a southern and more trap oriented style to the instrumental and it gets kind of old just like the joke I get kind of weary of hearing all these rattling high hats these punchy snares and these chords and arpeggios that switch back and forth between chromatic intervals throughout the track I said chromatic intervals it gets older than dirt and the thing is if you're at all familiar with 2chainz career I think it's going to get pretty annoying hearing him trying to put out one track after another that essentially is is making an attempt to recreate the success that he had last year with the track spend it I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing I understand and I'm completely accepting of the fact that this album is is very popular it's very hot right now but it's got no longevity to it if you've listened to this what do you think do you love it do you hate it why what should i review next remember the good comment the great rate the strong subscribe no matter how much you hate that line I'm going to say it and 2 Chainz based on a true story Anthony Fantan Oh Fred 
wX4OumIpl-Q,it's track review hey guys Anthony Santana here internet's busiest music nerd trying out a new camera angle let me know what you guys think about it leave a copy of a copy of a couple you become this is track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the everything persuasion now in this installment of track reviews we're going to talk about a new track from the band Muse but first I want to address an issue that a lot of people are bringing up in some messages some tweets some comments a bunch of my videos not a bunch of my videos all of my videos from 2009 pretty much have been deleted a lot of people are asking me why and here's a little ditty written by kaljaa chesta to help you remember why whenever you're asking yourself this question Kathy right Kathy right Kathy right that's why II deleted that videos it he recently another video from back then has gotten forcibly removed by YouTube and got me in a bit of hot water and I decided considering that I am sort of possibly kind of almost chancing Lea coming closer to making a living off doing this the risk really isn't worth it even though his musical year I do love 2009 god I love 2009 ah but don't be sad because I know it'll get those frowns turned upside down a review the new Muse track the second law unsustainable coming from the band's forthcoming LP the second law it's going to drop in October recently these guys penned and released what was the official song for the London Olympics for this year where the American women's gymnastics team ruled and now this alternative progressive and symphonic rock band is releasing this new track now at this point I think it's kind of sort of safe to say that Muse has been in a little bit of hot water with longtime fans for the only thing that longtime fans hate the most and that's changing your sound people don't always like change and that certainly happened on the LP the resistance where Muse came forward with a more symphonic sound more ambitious instrumentation surrounding their tracks a glassy ER production style frontman Matthew Bellamy was just throwing his political ideology out in his lyrics a lot more his vocals were just really getting more and more dramatic and on this LP I definitely admired the band for trying something outside of their comfort zone this is definitely not the kind of record that a band would make to kind of get a quick buck I admire that Muse is the kind of band that is up for taking a risk and it looks like they're up for taking another one with this brand new track and I'm not really sure it's a risk I can get down with really because on this song uses blending their usual alternative and symphonic rock style with the sounds of dubstep music the new ultra distorted ultra noisy and abrasive brand of dubstep that is coming from artists like Skrillex it's a style of dubstep that people perceive as being so different from what was originally conceived as being dubstep that they call it bro step I don't know if you would consider me a bro but I think what Skrillex is doing can be kind of fun and catchy and I find it really interesting that something so distorted and and noisy has gotten so wildly popular and I find it even more interesting that a band like Muse would even dare to incorporate it into their music despite the fact that consistently rock fans have been pretty aggressive toward this style of music and let me tell you Muse does not incorporate these dubstep elements subtly into this new song they push them right in your face after a pretty busy string introduction featuring some spoken word about energy and an ever growing economy is unsustainable after the string intro finishes Muse busts in with sixteenth notes on the hi-hat some very sparse bass kicks that are pretty thick and heavy and this wrong there are all these squealing bass wobbles and again this robot voice that is going on just hand a ball after Muse kept phase-in the track they start hitting on these very epic gargantuan monolithic symphonic chords Bellamy's voice comes in it's not really singing lyrics so much as it is just pruning and I think it's the best part of the song just his voice at that part in the track it's very epic however what kind of bugs me about this point in the song is that the chords are pretty much a progression that is kind of generic I feel like I've heard it in about a dozen soundtracks and the bass wobbles and the squeals that that are playing against this section in the song are pretty generic too if you've listened to any dubstep in the style of these guys are being inspired by right here like Skrillex or Nero or Rusco it's very clear that Muse is on the outside looking in on this whole dubstep thing it's like they didn't even make the effort to authentically recreate this sound and manipulate it to the point where it kind of became their own reinterpretation of it it really almost kind of sounds like they sampled it from somewhere else and just repeat it as they saw fit throughout the song and even though it kind of pains me to say it I think Korn did the whole dubstep rock fusion thing better though I do think Muse is really actually interested in in this kind of fusion and in dubstep in general don't think they're gonna drag it out for an entire LP honestly I didn't really like this track at all and and there's not really much I can say other than that what do you guys think of this track do you like it do you hate it are you surprised by muses approach on this thing do you think they're going to keep pursuing it not only on this new LP with more tracks but maybe on future releases let me know remember the good comment the great rate only the strong

ifoZ_rbwR_U,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review and the bowdabra let's try not to take ourselves too seriously shall we okay parquet courts light up gold these guys are rock quartet of Texan musicians who have made their way to New York City to put out their first big full-length album light up gold it's coming out this month on a label a small label that is run by the band's frontman Andrew savage dull tools and Andrew savage you may know from his songwriting and vocal contributions to other rubber bands and projects like teenage cool kids Ferguson Geronimo who also have a new album out on Hartley art and if you take a listen to this thing you're pretty much going to get one track after another of artsy stripped-down poet punk I like the production on this thing it's simple it's basic but it's got a lot of grit to it and it shows the band really kind of jamming these songs out together in the raw early that's what it feels like the guitars have a kind of rough quality when they're just hitting those downstroke chords and when they're playing leaves there's a really nice twang to them to that I like a really sharp twang eNOS why the drums are really lean they're really punchy fast and together with the guitars they really kind of drum up a wire or a feel ease or like a Devo kind of quality it's just a lot of punk and post-punk with some southern Western Americana tendencies with a few sonic exceptions like the track North Dakota which is like really slow dreary kind of a tired song or stoned and starving which I believe if I am remembering correctly is the longest song on here it's five minutes and it's kind of a jam for them or the tracks caster of worthless spells or the closer which feature a lot of reef on the vocals which does bring a different quality to the to the album to the string of tracks but I really didn't care for the effect on the vocals I thought it kind of took a little bit of personality away from what they were doing so you do kind of get this musical on sonic variety there's a lot of vocal variety on this thing too but Adam Savage usually brings that to his his projects you have high-pitched wails and whines like on the track yonder is closer to the heart which actually kind of gives the song and evaporators light quality on songs like the opener master of my craft he kind of hangs around his mid-range and I absolutely love songs like North Dakota where he delivers that really low-pitched deadpan that is just man and it's just got a really potent mood to it for the most part the vocals are on point there are a few tracks where I feel like they kind of weave in and out of pitch and not really in an endearing way a lot like the song no ideas and there are some tracks on here that do come off a bit too repetitive a lot like tears of plenty I know a lot of tracks on here have repetitious qualities but I guess I just like the riffs or the melodies and some songs more than others and that's what kind of makes me attracted to the repetition of some songs and just not really others others others the one to two-minute quirky cynical very energetic and minimal post-punk and punk tunes on here really shoot for a mood and message like on the track master of my craft the opener on here which is kind of about a really pretentious but successful person who sort of seems to be just enveloped in their own success and where it's brought them and how they kind of see everybody else is being beneath them and they really paint a funny character of this person this track glides just segues right into the next and I like that I wish that happened more often on this LP on some tracks they're just really big gaps some things that just aren't really connecting but the first third of this I'm just but after this opener the track borrowed time kind of things about the lighter side of being bored and apathetic but also kind of pining to be more inspired and the track donuts only is kind of like this one-minute musical monologue that describes a setting somewhere in Texas exaggerating the qualities of this place to kind of make it seem really weird and an alien and different like you can't get bagels their communion songs paired with light beer and in a church people are wearing robes that are sewn together by their closest relatives in this really tiny town parquet courts kind of head down the same lyrical road with the track North Dakota painting this picture of just mundaneness and deterioration and just urban squalor their tracks on here about a funeral service the joys of being both high and hungry and the last track on here is a bit of a reprieves which I imagine is kind of personal singing about maybe the storyteller that's been kind of spinning these yarns throughout the entire album growing old I really do like the lyrics on this thing there are some moments where I don't really connect with a story or get all that much out of it still most of what is being told here is told well and with a lot of hmm I can't say all too much that's negative about this LP and yet I can only praise it so much to you know I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing what did you guys think of it if you've listened to it did you like it hate it why and what should I review next thanks for watching remember the good comment the great rate and only the strong subscribe parquet courts forever [Music] 
Iy4We7f42DY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Ariel Pink's Haunted graffiti from Mariela pink nice um listen I know as of late there have been a few changes to the aesthetic to the look to the angle to the everything I never really 100% cared for the camera angle that I was just shooting with but the number one thing that bothered me about the camera angle was that I didn't have room for a wack calzone but now now I do so having said that let's do a friggin review Ariel Pink's Haunted graffiti matuwir fiends this is not the second album from this band but I'm sure it's going to be for a lot of people who were turned on to them just a few years ago when they put out their breakthrough LP before today my but if you are in fact unfamiliar with Ariel pink he is a producer multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Haunted graffiti is his band though he has released quite a bit of music solo and and in other projects as well and to me Ariel Pink's last album was really kind of his coming out party more than it was in overall overhaul of his sound and style especially considering a lot of songs off of that LP were either just reworks or revamps of tracks that haunted graffiti had already made an ariel who was just notorious for working with a very low v sound had a pretty preservers are pristine recording this time around it still embraced kind of a very vintage aesthetic but it was definitely by no means lo-fi they were still referencing just about any genre of popular music that they liked from synth pop to new wave to psych pop disco as well and they performed all these genres with full awareness of the potential corniness of all of them and it seemed like they at every opportunity would take this corniness and just crank it up to the point where the music became kind of a parody of itself kind of like Frank Zappa goofing on hollow notes or the Bee Gees or the Thompson Twins and though Ariel Pink's music can at times feel like a very zany parody it is still a very well produced and well performed parody and I feel like that theme continues on mature themes I would actually say to a degree this album is a little bit of a return to Ariel Pink's roots if anything kind of separates before today from the rest of Ariel Pink's discography it's a very big presentation for his music it's a very outgoing and kind of ambitious album it really kind of flies its freak flag when previous albums were kind of content to really revel in their obscurity revel in their low fiber cording style and just their overall lack of expectations however on this LP that lack of expectation kind of comes in the form of some really understated and uninvent er songs for Ariel Haunter graffiti is is a lot less willing on these songs to be kind of experimental and destructive and out there sonically a great majority of the songs on here don't really want to get dirty and on the other hand they also don't want to rock and and put a lot of energy out there they don't want to be exciting either there there are still a lot of kooky vocals time warp time warp and confuse says really making use of his range and of course there are some weird falsetto vocals in the background a lot of these tracks too and there are tracks on here that just have notably weird lyrics like schnitzel boogie which kind of goes into detail out of eating some schnitzel and the song Symphony of the nymph - which is pretty hilarious but for me it just doesn't go far enough to be all that memorable as memorable as before today or is his loaf I work but I will admit there are a few moments on here where being really straightforward just putting a great song great catchy pops on a silver platter and just serving it up directly works out and Ariel's favor like my favorite song on here mature themes which has Ariel's voice not obscured at all and he's actually singing over an acoustic guitar he can be really romantic and sensual and just intoxicating in a song however it songs like is this the best spot or driftwood where Ariel kind of takes his as usual mutant synth-pop approach and it just comes out as being less melodic less developed I can't even really say much that's positive about the track nostradamus at me which is kind of like this ambience in Odyssey that lasts almost a minutes and the last track on here though it does have some nice vocals and a good groove to it and a nice 60s soul ambience it doesn't really move past the initial idea puts out there and and on before today what I admired so much about how Ariel put songs together on that album is that there were tracks that just felt like multi-phase here not so much even on the songs that I like though it feels like I have a lot of complaints with this LP I did like it and a handful of my my favorite Ariel pink songs and or moments did make it onto this thing and I do have to give it to it for that kind of feeling a decent two strong six on this LP what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantan Oh Ariel Pink's Haunted graffiti forever 
vu_Busuilos,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd working on my focus and it's time for a review Nikki and the Dove instinct these guys are a Swedish synth pop duo this is their debut full-length album which is a combination of tracks that are new and tracks that appeared on some EPS that have been previously released now I've talked about Swedish pop music on this channel before Swedish pop and rock artists have had a pretty long standing history of creating music that has seen success in the American music scene both mainstream and underground and though Nikki and the death hasn't completely taken off on this side of the pond as of right now there's still reason to believe that it's it's possible Cal is certainly excited at the prospect that's good part of the reason I have faith in the Mickey and the Dove duo is that I think what they're doing is just so universal I mean who doesn't like lushly colored production passionate lead vocals and catchy hooks except fuddy-duddies these guys have the ability to kind of approach a song with a more simplistic approach or you know more experimental or dramatic approach and still kind of come out on top like the opener on here tomorrow so many synth textures on that track especially on the hook which makes this track just such a a grandiose introduction because the chorus on this thing is just an explosion that you believe of sounds it's a rainbow orgasm in my years going further left-field as the track gentle roar which is kind of a spot where the synthesizers take a bit of a break and you just get this really primal fat heavy rhythm matched up with all of these multitrack vocals making it somewhat of a chant in a way again Nicki and the Dove no problem can do dramatic and strange but they do straightforward really well - like with the track in your eyes which two meters has really seductive qualities the sense glisten like an ice sculpture and it has a really danceable beat and groove to it that for some reason kind of reminds me of the 70s maybe disco it's not completely something that I can put my finger on whether is the rhythm itself or the chord progression but it's there for me but still as Nicki in the dove is being pretty direct on this track they are still finding ways to work in weird sounds and effects like the bridge which is which is very very subtle and quiet almost ambient with all these twinkling acoustic sounds on it and the intro also features those sounds as well Nicki and the Dove definitely approaches these different angles with some nice contrast between the verses and the choruses some decent hooks but I'm not completely impressed with every one of their songs throughout some songs really strike me as having some pretty corny lyrics most notably the beach and the tracks the drummer and DJ ease my mind too but the thing is those two tracks take an overtly electro approach with the production which kind of takes me out of the general musical theme of the other tracks which makes this album as a whole feel kind of disjointed because most of the time Nikki in the dev are switching back and forth between embracing the knife and little dragon as inspirations for their songs when it comes to production vocal delivery or songwriting style and I feel like Nikki and the dub doesn't always apply these influences to the best of their abilities like on the track love to the test which is a pretty nice song when we're breaking down melody and lyrics it's kind of a tender ballad but vocally it's delivered with this wailing Karen drear Andersson esque vocal style and I'm not really sure it fits the theme of the song so really that's kind of the only other major thing I can fault this LP on it doesn't really come forward with its own sound or direction if you've already heard the knife little dragon or even that I am mi Who am I album that dropped earlier this year I'm not completely sure this album is going to bring anything new to you maybe there are poppier moments here and there maybe there are moments that feel a little more lush but it's not like the songwriting was so memorable and the ambition was so immense that I was consistently impressed with this LP especially around the last third of this album where I think Nicky and the Dove pretty much stopped adding variety it's actually kind of weird I feel like the production on that last third of this LP is kind of different - it feels less lush and colorful than the nine or so songs that come before it it's kind of like listening to an entirely different release that was just tagged on to the back end of this thing I know for the most part this album is just culmination of tracks that pre-existed this release but I don't really feel like that should be so apparent that it kind of ruins the flow of the album so I'm kind of feeling too light too decent six on this LP what did you guys think of it did you love it hey good why and what should I review next remember the good comment and the green room but only the strong subscribe right there right you have to be Fantana Nikki and the dub forever 
c42Yr9yXzdk,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a compilation review our Stevie Moore lo-fi high-fives and wink that to its door to get our CD more but they didn't have any there then so why you didn't care and I left thank you thank you this guy is easily one of the most interesting figures in DIY self recorded music DIY recording artists have had a long history of making music that is not technically up to snuff when it comes to the sound quality of more professional recordings but many who have decided to go it alone have made up for it with personality and sometimes even the development of their own sound because of the lack of constraints that comes with handling your own production artists like mount Erie or Daniel Johnston or smog or another artist so I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with who looks up to our Stevie Moore Arial pink now more has been self recording since about the 60s and he has taken full advantage of that lack of constraints that I mentioned recording not just pop and rock music but Noise music and punk music and avant-garde music as well electronics solo synth pieces spoken word and there are at least 200 different projects uploaded to the man's Bandcamp page right now old and new however despite the very alienating moments in his discography the parts in his discography that I'm sure you're just not going to like the songs that are good are so good and and so weird and and just so ear pleasing to me anyway that it makes plunging your hands into his discography and just digging through it kind of worth it Stevie's whole career has just kind of been defined by exploration for the sake of it good or bad and to become an art Stevie Moore fan you kind of have to have that same characteristic about you're listening that he does about his creating and I think this new compilation could be kind of a gateway drug to that because it really is a collection of 14 tracks that are some of Stevie's more accessible moments for sure it pretty much just stays within the pop and rock realm with a few weird exceptions the opener on this compilation pop music is not one of my favorite songs of his I think it's a better statement than it is a song however it kind of is a perfect opener for this compilation because it really kind of sets the bar for the weirdness the melody on this thing is just so jagged it's just so angular it's performed in this very strange falsetto vocal the first two tracks on this thing really are kind of choppy water for me after that things seem to smooth out with the track why should I love you which comes from one of my favorite are Stevie more albums glad music it is one of the funnier love songs that I've ever heard period and you can really tell on this song that Stevie is recording really in another place in another time and I just prefer this sound of his older recordings so much more than the sum of his newer ones which have a more kind of digital quality to them still that doesn't stop a next song from being very awesome Dutch me which is a very syrupy very I guess melancholic kind of slow jam featuring aerial pink on vocals I'm pretty sure it's actually cut from the collaborative album the two of them put out recently some acoustic numbers come in after that although I'm not a huge fan of the track big mistake it meanders a little bit for me but afterwards here comes the summer it's a song that I've already known from our Stevie more but it seems a little revamped on this thing some extra reverb to kind of enhance that large phil spector esque the an Aram excel that really brings out the pet sounds qualities of this track that I know stevia was going for in at least the writing of the song anyway the track hurry up has these loud pounding drums where the gate sort of seems to be messed with a little bit with some muddy guitar Stevie Moore is whispering literally about hurrying up on the track it's one of the stranger subject matters on the song that and the the last track which is hilarious we're Stevie Morris singing lyrics over and over and over saying things like I'm tired of singing about girls because I can't find any the man has a lot of musical eccentricities but he clearly has a lot of wit and just comedy to to his lyrics at times too however I will say that this compilation is kind of hit or miss and I feel like that comes with the territory of writing so much music and striving to make every song kind of different or unique in its own way you're gonna be trying things that aren't necessarily great ideas just to make the song different which kind of makes an album or a compilation not the best kind of format to experience our Stevie more in my opinion I mean sure it's a great way to get interested and be introduced to the man but my most rewarding experiences with our Stevie Moore's music have always been when I've just blindly kind of headed into whatever project or album he's put up on the internet and just cherry-picking what I think is a great moment you know had of whatever he's put out there and just kind of letting it be that so I did like this compilation not too much though it felt kind of like a strong six to a light seven for me so what did you guys think of this compilation if you've heard it did you love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana or Stevie Moore forever

you know at least let people get a copy of that digital you know what I mean I like the digital downloads that come with the records because even though I do like listening to vinyl sometimes I'm out got the mp3 player you know I don't always have the time to spin my red ass vinyl you know that's it and I do like the UH the labeling on here too like this pressing light colored records like candy alright give that back in here gentle gentle now gentle gentle I hate it when the sleeves are small and you can't get the damn record in there alright you know I skipped over this record just want to mention that I where the heck is it now lost it where'd I put it there is oh damn it's not like this is a rare record or anything like that nice Beatles 12-inch got Hey Jude on here revolution

and you know just sort of make your own record cover or whatever got the lyrics and kind of a print back they're sort of you know various sound files not sound files the files holding sound files that I imagine our samples that they incorporated on the album and I'm gonna ask Chris to kind of do a close-up and then try to get up you know a good a good view of this but this is the D side of the record there is music on the a B and C side but on the D side can you see that at all yeah yeah you have a print of those sound files on on here it's kind of textured you know it's an interesting nice little extra pressing you know they don't know what to do with the D side there's room there oh hey let's put art on that that's an awesome idea do that more love that all right let's see what Nexus has got David Bowie Space Oddity um limited additional limited edition vinyl LP but I don't recall anything amazing about the depressing labeling or anything like that on black vinyl but is this a plastic sleeve no it's not but it is a nice heavy pressing reissue it's nice and clean I do love that song Space Odyssey you know Space Oddity not a I guess a not a favorite of mine in Bowie's discography but does have some of my favorite songs from him of course I mean the this copy is beat to crap a body used but David Bowie's uh horizon falls as if you start us like I said the beat to crap nothing amazing about the vinyl pressing but the record is clean it's in good shape the sleeve is pretty much falling apart but though got that nice old-school picture there that's cool rock and roll suicide oh man we're flying through you're flying through oh man I still got this bright black morning light I remember this is like one of the first bands I reviewed on my channel when I was like doing track reviews or something I kept this record wasn't one of my favorites of that year I don't think but I just liked the psychedelic undertones of this LP you really kind of a slightly ever so slightly underrated record you know I just really like how meditative this album is I like all the the various sounds on it I caught the band's live once but unfortunately because they just play so quietly oh then it's not nice marbled white vinyl forgot that completely I should play this record I haven't listened to this record in a long time unfortunately when I saw them live they played so quietly that people in the bar where they were playing we're talking louder than they were playing and I hate that all right don't do that all right moving on Oh me and Chris like this record you have a soft spot in our hearts for this record it's bright eyes LP and wide awake it's morning really like I guess the last record from Connor overs that I loved although I bet that new disappearing students yeah the new track he put out that was good did you hear the the b-side no I haven't heard the B sense it's also good it's also good but that track is good you rocked him and he rocked it nice thick vinyl pressing on this you have a bind all of this - yes okay Chris has got the vinyl - okay like all of you for doing Chris's office wage index you know I I do like you know you don't really get the sense of this from looking at the album cover or digitally online but you know when you get the record you know you really get the sense of oh man this is cloth and this is like this is not a painting or a drawing or anything like that this is stitched you know and it's like you're getting all these cloth leaves on here you really get to just sort of drink in the details of the album art on this one and and this is one album where I'm particularly fond of just the way the art was created okay moving on got that Danny Brown xxx and what's in the middle Bam Bam Bam minimalism um double LP on white vinyl I believe this on white on white wax oh yeah be it be and I believe it does come with a 7-inch as well it's a nice little package I bought it kind of a discounted thing because the corner was was was bent and I get a lyric sheet on here too BAM that's an inch in here somewhere where'd it go where is it it's hiding there it is here you go you got a little seven inch of die like a rockstar and blunt after blunt with the life or and I will acapellas on this so if I ever want to just put this on to just listen to Danny Browns voice I can because I have that freedom all right let's see what is it live the Brubeck LP featuring Paul Desmond jazz at the Blackhawk a friend of mine gave me this record and if I am correct this has an interesting colored pressing oh yeah this is this is red marble as well nice this is swanky this has got some Swank to it a good friend of mine - Derek gave me that record and this is another record I'm fond of nothing amazing about the pressing but I will just say the Bhutto's band fantastic fantastic group I didn't really love their last album but you know their their initial LPS this EP i dapped own records solid solid releases of you know instrumental jazz funk this is a repressing of this album unfortunately this is a one of the Buzzcocks earliest releases but even though it is a repress I do like this release a lot really great Punk LP spiral scratch has some of their best material on here in my opinion breakdown times up boredom friends of mine really short 12-inch EP but I do like the you know the classic vintage labeling that they have on the record good pressing but of course that's to be oh I'm gonna have to cut this one off alright once we come back we have some John Cale that's next getting into the C's we're finally out of the bees and yeah thanks for watching Anthony Fantana vinyl forever [Music] 
vLVcFNms9Xw,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd doing another installation of records unedited raw doing it raw and this time Chris capella is manning the camera not my girlfriend not anybody else but as you know him intern Chris say something so as they know I'm not lying I he's not lying I'm doing it senior okay alright so last time we left off on the Beatles White Album but I did go to the record store laughs of in but in between the making of the last video and this one and oh wait horn I'm gonna do this for 10 minutes let me start that timer and I picked up this reissue of this album Afrika Bambaataa in the soul sonic force planet rock the album Rock Brown Planet Rock um like I said this is a reissue but it's still a great LP most of my rap albums are either on CD or have digital copies of them however this particular album I I didn't have a copy on either format so I figured you know vinyl why the hell not not really you know anything incredibly amazing about the packaging other than that is it is a pretty thick pressing um there's nothing on here telling me that it's 180 gram but it is it is pretty thick and I'm gonna guess that it is alright now where we left off right here with the white album got a stereo copy of this I don't know if this is an original issue it is it is certainly old as as as hell certainly older than me there's a bit of tape on it yet is a stereo a copy of it and even though it a little beat up you do have kind of the record where on the outside of the LP the records themselves are in very good condition although I probably should get different sleeves for them you know very great condition the records aren't fantastic conditioning somebody even had like their name and their address on like a label on here case I don't know what the record got lost like it found please return to so-and-so and this is a little sleeve with the with lyrics on it but what I am happiest most about this pressing when I picked it up and I I think I just bought this for like maybe 2530 dollars is that come on come on I've got all four of the glossy Beatles photos that come with this frickin record usually from what I understand you know you'll find a lot of copies but you will not find the pictures with them come on go back in do got John to there's John there's Ringo with sporting that mustache back in the day he doesn't what he doesn't wrap that mustache anymore unfortunately okay moving on on to the Nexus 100k if you like your death metal instrumental and ultra technical to the point where it is just almost emotionless and extremely flashy look up behold the AH part Arctic pusses skull grid this is a mindfuck of an album there's not really any other made-up word that you can use and I do love the vinyl pressing on this thing really nice black and red marble color on here I love the even if I end up hating this record into the future I may just keep it because it is so pretty to look at remember I bought that when I saw them live okay next I bought this recently over at a red scroll records vinyl copy of a big crits crib was here to stay a double LP very thick vinyl pressing you know not a gatefold or anything like that or any amazing inserts though you know if you're crazy about record art or whatever like that you know you you may be missing out with this with this release still it's a it's a really great tape and it's it's something that I wanted to support to sort of have a copy of something that crate had done and you know the the vinyl sounds great sounds really good okay you see Black Keys rubber factory dang this is my favorite Black Keys record I had a few other Black Keys records but I ended up selling them just because I like this one so much more um but still I still sleeve lyrics their album art album art in it a very young Dan Auerbach right there rubber factory nothing readily amazing to say about the art next to our Black Lips records I see five minutes all right I just got this one recently good bad not evil this is one of my favorites of theirs but for some reason I've only had a digital copy and never really went out and got the vinyl I like the gatefold on this thing I like the lyrics on this thing weird pictures of them got the nothing amazing about the album art itself black vinyl you've got on in the red records I like their labeling that they do right there on their LPS I like that logo and got Arabian what the heck forgot the name of this freaking record hotels Titleist record Arabian Nights knows on Raven nights is it Arabia mountain how the hell I never get that um family tree on here Modern Art better with the remembering hooks that I am song titles but yeah kind of zany album art not really the most amazing packaging in the world but it is a good record I remember we're viewing this record I don't think I did I think it did an audio review on it and I still do like the record it's just that you know maybe with black lips I feel personally like I'm bored forgetting I really like that dirty style of garage rock but they do even though they pretty much you know do it on every album alright next black nonsuit rainbow dandelion gum nice little scratch-and-sniff bubble here like the only scratch-and-sniff record cover that I own it still smells like bubblegum for whatever reason and I've had it for at least a couple years comes with a no it doesn't come with that you see nothing particularly amazing about the record color or anything like that but I do like the weird fuzzy label that they have here the side a it's like you barely read the song titles because it's all like fuzz down kind of blurry um if you haven't heard this record I mean it's an interesting mix of electronic music and psychedelic music and hip-hop as well not that anybody who's rapping on it but it kind of takes a rhythm wides like a really strong I guess hip hop flavor to just to the beats but a but a really nice interesting and zany gatefold that I feel goes along with the vibe of the music alright moving on ooh I like this record this is definitely one of my favorite records the yura came out was 2008 it was okay hi I'm fires in the future nice little prog and classic rock revival album strange gatefold where is that baby face coming from I don't know why are there deer there I don't know what is this sort of like you know 3d shape geometry look at that shirt more dear holy um nice vinyl pressing on this one too if I am correct I think it's just black vinyl but yeah this is a this is a thick nice nice good pressing I like that it's a double LP I like that you know you get an ABC nd side that last song is like a really nice extended cut so you know really just like playing it through the whole record double LP is like this it's like an odyssey and I like that all right moving on James Blake dad yo got picture James right there picture James right there what do we have right there picture James right there with blackness and a picture of James right there so I mean you know you essentially get four blurry photographs of James and a group of songs that he wrote that I that I care for quite a bit and there are a few songs on this vinyl pressing that are not on the CD version I believe which is part of the reason that I picked this up I don't know what that was signifying all right let me see time what's up at the time I don't know we're going to say okay bond Ripper yeah this is what the hell's name of those records let me see Satan worshipping doom this one's not a gatefold either but is it a Double L thing it is but this one has a nice interesting color to it vile cover nude bodies devil thing goat demon woman it's it's pretty nasty same thing with the back I mean definitely not you know kind of stuff that they put in children's storybooks yeah this is a nice read pressing I believe I'm pretty sure I bought this for my birthday oh right hand cup oh uh that's it we got to call it quits um going to move on with this record in the next video thank you for watching anthing Fantana vinyl forever [Music] you 
sYTTtVb1Nus,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd doing a sort of somewhat kind of monthly segment called y-you know review where i talk about group of albums that have come out within the past couple months that i have overlooked haven't gotten a chance to review and i figured i could just kind of give a quick opinion on them gauntlet style starting things off guided by voices latest LP class clown spots a UFO the second full-length album the legendary experimental lo-fi indie rock band has put out this year of course their latest releases not sounding all too low phi especially this one being much less psychedelic and obtuse abstract than the last full-length album they put out which i gave a kind of on the fence review to i would actually say that this is the album that the band should have put out first it really would have been a much more accessible listen for people kind of grouping around them because there was a hiatus before they started releasing albums again this year this is is much more easy on the ears definitely something worth checking out i think it is on par with the other accessible albums that these guys have to offer like half smiles decomposed but still nothing extremely thrilling exciting or just revolutionary for guided by voices okay next one an album that a lot of people were asking me to talk about the new Gojira album hope I'm pronouncing that correctly these guys are pretty famed for their very clean progressive and inspiring approach to death metal especially off very celebrated albums like from Mars to Sirius which is a very long winding riff Odyssey and I guess I was kind of sad to see that fewer of those so brach elements have made it onto this new album and they're not really being replaced with anything I feel like on this LP the band has simplified their sound to the point where it really kind of sounds like radio metal just the the chugga-chugga riffs and and the hooks especially on the title track strike me as something that I feel could be played right after a disturbed song and and few radio listeners would you know click to another station which is fine if you're into that kind of thing but I am NOT particularly though this album does take you pretty clean and just well-produced approach to death metal that I know is very popular right now this is just not as impressive or ambitious as gojira's previous releases next the self-titled Evo band album out now on Sub Pop Records these guys are an Ethiopian pop band with some really foreign grooves and bright horns there are some pretty catchy tracks on here just a lot of personality a lot of spice musical spice but there are some tracks that do under well me because I don't feel like as a unit these guys play together that intensely and I wish some of the solos were a bit flashy ER on here too but outside of that it's it's worth checking out if you're looking for something with more of an international aesthetic next the new antlers EP under C these guys are very soft dreamy indie rock band with some pretty celebrated releases hospice Burst Apart neither of which I am really a fan of and if you are into them that's fine these guys if you're unfamiliar with them are known for their very subtle delivery that's supposed to be big on emotions and and concepts but still even on this EP the antlers continue to create the most simulated sadness in underground rock and pop today the onslaught continues with four new tracks on this EP all of which kind of experiment with some more atmospheric ambient and more ethereal sounds and that may be exciting for fans to kind of hear the band breach new sonic territory but none of the noises none of the textures were really gripping me I just found this EP to be kind of underwhelming I just don't really connect with this band emotionally and that's it next the new Jeff the Brotherhood album hypnotic nights these guys are a power pop duo this is their latest LP loaded with songs that are built on rough distortion simple hooks served a la Weezer with a bit of a STONER attitude I feel like Jeff the Brotherhood continued to have just uniquely bad lyrics on their songs but they also sort of seemed to be conscious of how bad they are and can have a level of just a tongue-in-cheek Ness to it and that's fun I do think this band is fun pretty much every LP they have put out on some level is fun to listen to at least once and they certainly have energy too but I just feel like their songs can be kind of hit or miss or just to alight their influences to really kind of make me feel like ooh that's new like I said it was fun to listen to but it's not a record I'm pining to return to me get you in the shapes never this is the latest release from singer-songwriter sonic experimentalist and music eccentric mikachu and her backing band the shapes and this new LP sadly in comparison with the debut release that make it you had the hype behind this thing is just oh so tiny and it kind of makes sense when you look at what made the debut LP so popular so widespread it had some very strong memorable and catchy singles calculator vulture lips great fun memorable tunes I'm sure it also helped that some of those songs were paired with interestingly shot music videos music videos aside never just does not have many catchy songs on it at all however I will say Miku seems to be as intent as ever to experiment with sounds and and I guess different styles as well there is a moment on here that feels very ambient very kind of formless wide vast and open there's another track on here that strikes me as being a kind of long-form stargazing ballad but the biggest letdowns on here are the tracks that sound like tracks that could have been on last LP but are just way less impressive Tenacious D Rises the Phoenix a lot of people asked me about this record a lot of people and I gotta say when I listened to this album it really makes me kind of feel like the Queen of England or something like I just sit and I listen and I think to myself hmmm we are not amused I just don't feel like Tenacious D is funny hmm I don't think it's funny and that's it it's just not really my brand of comedy which I imagine would be essential to have when it comes to listening to a comedic rock album the latest childish gambino mixtape a lot of people asked me about this as well MC and producer Donald Glover brings another series of tracks on here where he showcases his kind of whiny voice is very fiery flow and kind of unaware rhymes which is my biggest issue with a lot of this dude's work that he'll rap about personal stuff he'll rap about his perception of the world or the perception of his character in hip-hop game but to me it just seems so off dropping a line about how he's making it in the game despite not having a cosign which is kind of ridiculous considering that he obviously came into the game from being an actor comedian writer celebrity and the other line he dropped about not letting these white people tell him how to feel it just seems like the ridiculous finger pointing that was going on with his last LP where he was just lashing out at the hip-hop community for for just not getting him he's just so misunderstood and yet he's not even really that unique and there are tons of rappers out there who are unique and are having trouble getting people to listen to them because they're so out there but I did find this mixtape to be more tolerable than camp because Donald doesn't really do a lot of that personal stuff on this mixtape despite his whine about not letting people tell him how to feel he doesn't really go down that road all too often he does a lot of pop rap songs on here he raps over a lot of southern style beats on this thing just kind of keeps to his punchlines his misogyny there actually some songs on here like the track one up that feel like they could kind of work in the club so was I less annoyed this time around yeah I was but I don't feel like it's because childish gambino improved his game or anything it's because I like the beats a bit more he's being less whiny less overly personal and you have a ton of features on here most of which I like but the only reason I feel like they help the album is because when they're rapping I'm not hearing Donald rapping next the new Ana Vaughn house wolf album ceremony I was honestly disappointed with this I thought her last LP was really really good had a lot of raw passionate piano ballads on there and this new album sort of seems to be mainly centered around the organ which seems as if it were recorded inside of a church or Cathedral of some sort the song seemed a bit more I guess long-winded obtuse and the whole thing is just slathered in this very natural reverb that makes this album have kind of a in pop beach house esque feel and I'm not sure I really like it her vocals don't strike me as being as emotive the songs don't really feel all that memorable it's just kind of an LP I don't know what to do with just really kind of a letdown for me not really the direction I expected from her but because of how much I do like that last album I will definitely check out whatever she does after this Fang island major this is the follow-up LP to what was probably one of the most energetic and hyper melodic indie rock records of 2010 this band's self-titled LP and major chases that album with a style that sounds more like just traditional rock songwriting the band has toned down the guitar heroism a little bit all the melody just a little bit and they're relying more on their verses and their courses their bridges just like I said straightforward rock song writing with an indie flavor to it and it's just not as memorable I feel like Fang Island has tried to make I guess a more mature album this time around and they opened it up with a really great introductory track which seems like a more refined version of what they already do with piano and harmonized guitar leads I would have loved to hear an album that kind of went down that route but after that intro you just get one regular kind of rock song after another and it just kind of feels toned down and just less immaculate Jeremiah Jay raw money wraps this guy is a brain feeder Records signed rapper and producer this is his debut full-length and this thing does have 19 strange colorful smooth instrumentals that I think are pretty good but I'm not really all that impressed by this guy as a rapper he has this very kind of understated quiet flow that is a bit monotonous but he is just so quiet on this thing he's almost at a mumble with some of these tracks which I could totally see him getting away with if I was more into his lyrical content which has a lot of I guess sort of contemporary underground hip-hop swag to it mentions of girls of twitter haters money I just don't think it's all that exciting and I do realize that there are some subtle nuances in meaning to what Jeremiah J is rapping about but what I have picked up of it I didn't really find to be all that poignant if I'm going to go down this sort of quiet weird alternative hip-hop road I'd much rather listen to Blues no York or like Shabazz Palaces next coin Locker kid the ghost Sonata another alternative hip-hop album this guy lyrically is way more abstract has also a kind of understated flow but but just has a bit of a raspy weird quality to it that I like and the beats that he puts together are pretty strange I did find it to maybe be a little too obtuse I would have liked it to be a bit more hard-hitting something like that maybe a bit more colorful but it is kind of bleak dark and just notably so if you're looking for something on the stranger side of hip-hop this is worth looking into the new peaking lights LP Lucifer these guys have a quiet almost lo-fi kind of aesthetic it's subtly psychedelic too with its instrumentation with its effects and even some tracks on here have a kind of domed reggae feel to them that I liked a lot but it just feels so distant there is so much reverb on it that I feel like it takes away from the music a bit kind of alienate sit and the vocalist is she I guess is a bit underwhelming for me I don't really find her to be a thrill to listen to I don't feel like she has that much range a beautiful voice a lot of personality I guess I was just left kind of underwhelmed by this thing I liked their last LP more but I will admit that I wasn't really huge into that as well like I know some people were next the new garbage album not your kind of people garbage 90s alternative rock sensation and on this thing I just couldn't help but feel like they're making a record that is going to appeal to the sensibilities of the now older crowd that kind of grew up on them in the 90s to me they weren't really pushing into anything exciting I don't even think some of the songs on here were all that memorable but in a way it kind of reminded me of listening to that b-52s album Funplex like sure this isn't the furthest a band can fall but it's not really an album I was excited to listen through next the new job for shantae EP letter left her a lot of people asked me to review this EP I thought I was going to I just didn't get a chance to there were other things I would have rather or viewed and I will say I did like it it's not going to end up being one of my favorite EPS of the year but what it did do for me was that it excited me to hear John's next full-length LP because from what I understand both this EP and that LP are experimenting more with sense and electronics although from what I have read he assures fans that this EP is going to be completely different from that LP in what way I don't know but even if that LP is a smidge like this EP it's going to be pretty interesting and man this thing is just such a mishmash of sounds and styles art pops synth pop just electronic music and hip hop as well with guests rapping on here from RZA of wu-tang clan and I guess my main issue with the EP which which is why I'm excited for the LP is that I don't feel like this level of experimentation is complemented all too well by just the short 15 or 16 minute length that this thing has to offer I just would have liked to have heard more just everything kind of drawn out develop more just so I can get a better grasp of the a vision that John has going for for this kind of collision of styles and finally the new Gaslight Anthem LP handwritten these guys are a New Jersey rock group latest album and they to me have toned down their punk rock spirit a lot on this album to kind of embrace their usual Bruce Springsteen influence even more hero worship can be pretty cool but I kind of feel like the 59 sound had the perfect balance between that punk sound and that sort of burst influence I mean it was just you know a tightrope walk executed perfectly I will say that there are some moments where the songwriting and the vocals do strike me as being very passionate I just didn't find this thing to be all that exciting of of a listen The Gaslight Anthem definitely have sanitized things a little bit have toned down just their rock energy to follow in these Springsteen footsteps I felt like they had something more original going on on their previous LPS and that is pretty much it for the y-you know review for this month however long it takes me to make another okay okay thank you for watching and sitting through this entire thing if in fact you have and you weren't skipping around

bxkMo9ECakI,I already know that tack tack tack tack haha hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Domo Genesis no idols Domo Domo Genesis is an MC member of the California rap clique Odd Future he's released three major projects since he's been with them in 2010 it was rolling papers last year he had the utter the influence mixtape and this is his latest and really his biggest and most ambitious projects so far and what makes this project special is that not only are there some pretty notable underground hip-hop features on this thing but all the production is handled by The Alchemist someone outside the Odd Future circle somebody who is a pretty awesome and forward-thinking hip hop producer he's done remixes worked with artists like Jake one gangrene evidence Freddie Gibbs Action Bronson and he brings those connections to this album which leads to some features with a few of those artists like Freddie Gibbs and Action Bronson and somehow even space goes purp ends up on this thing as well as some Odd Future members and Odd Future affiliates like Vince staples now most importantly the alchemists involvement on this project leads to some really good beats right from the word go with the first instrumental on this thing prophecy you get these really dramatic pianos dramatic guitar solo cuts cuts looped around for a really nice effect a heavy kick drum and domo is flowing over the track a little bit nicer than he has on beats from his previous projects on the song fuck everybody else you get a very light string drone hanging in the background the beat is really sparse I like how you kind of have a a rolling snare drum kind of building up to the kick build bill building up to the kick on that there's a nice synth riff in there too it's really moody instrumental that I think is stellar and you get some high-pitched vocal samples that are chopped and looped on this thing too like on the instrumental for all and I love how on that track specifically the bass and the drum samples on that thing have such a warm analog feel to them like they were lifted straight from vinyl or straight from a cassette tape or something and the fluttering stints on the track me and my bitch are kind of pretty and very conducive for the love song style that that track is going for overall with no idols the production has a lot of versatility and I do have to give it to the alchemist because I don't feel like you really held back with any of the instrumentals on this thing whether he was giving Domo some instrumentals that he had made beforehand knowing that they were good or made them specifically for this project but I don't feel like this tape is perfect any and all issues I have with it pretty much lie with Domo a lot like that untitled Hodgy Beats EP that dropped earlier this year you get a slew of really great and creative colorful instrumentals given to an MC who is just really kind of bland because as far as the lyrics go on this thing all I am hearing are cliches boring stories and really corny similes like on the track me in my bitch which is a love song where domo pretty much wraps about his love for marijuana but makes marijuana into this woman like figure in the song really I can probably spend one hour on datpiff and find 50 songs that do the exact same thing and I have no reason to believe domos doing it any better than any one of them even the hook on me and my bitches is pretty trashy most of the tracks on here do not have hooks though it's pretty much Domo just rapping straight for one to two minutes depending on whether or not there is a verse from a guest and that would be fine if he was a great lyricist or had a flow that was constantly changing up wasn't so monotonous or just had a lot of wordplay to his verses but he doesn't like lifting up like the collar of Kanye and college dropout to be honest when I drop it I'm knocking the whole block out it's not terrible but he's not we saying anything just a lot of really empty brags left and right and nothing clever nothing funny document my awesomeness because I don't like to freestyle I like to hit the dougie while she's sucking on my penile there is not an original lyrical idea or song concept on this entire album and again that would be fine if Domo was proficient in what he's doing lyrically this album is very average it's very middle-of-the-road sure Domo does not come off as angry or hostile or angsty as some of the other odd future members most notably Tyler who is also on this LP but in comparison with with a guy like Tyler Domo just doesn't have that much personality he doesn't have a lot of force to his voice his flow doesn't really have any dynamic to it and he doesn't really have a story either what little story he does have which really kind of comes out on the first track sounds like the same story every other struggling internet rapper has despit about on their personal tracks I don't even feel like some of the guest features on here bring that much fire like Action Bronson I'm like the boss from the end of the Nintendo game my brain is on another level I can feel the devil's pain I've heard him spit at better lines than that but still I think action does kind of wrap Domo under the table on this album so does Freddie Gibbs and so does domos Odd Future cohorts Tyler brings more fire more excitement and Earl has more subtle wordplay worked in his verses so overall did I find anything horrible on this album no you know not really but was there anything that I was really interested in we're liking aside from the production know so I'm kind of feeling a strong four to a like five on this mixtape what did you guys think of it if you listened to it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next remember the good comment and the great rate but only is strong subscribed Anthony Fantana no idols The Alchemist forever [Music] [Music] 
pRL_6Lf9Xrg,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's sweatiest music nerd and it's time for a review own ad songs ohm is a duo that has been exploring the darker and the slower side of rock and metal music for about five studio albums now including this one and the duo originally formed after the seminal stoner and doom metal band sleep had disbanded the bassist and the drummer got together made ohm while Matt Pike guitar player and singer kind of went off and did high on fire I will admit I am much more of a high on fire guy and I'm not saying that you have to like either ohm or high on fire but when it comes to rock music that takes a more meditative approach ohm is easily one of my least favorite groups period but the thing is almost every album that own puts out displeases me for pretty much the same exact reasons for one Alf Cisneros vocals whose name I'm probably butchering to death but his vocals to me are just really underwhelming amateur just uninteresting and the bass lines that he plays to are pretty forgettable but I keep giving own a try whenever they put out a new LP because I love this style of music and their fans are really passionate about what they do plus they have continuously worked with Steve Albini to produce their records another guy I have an immense respect for and I don't think he would continue working with ohm if he didn't really love what they were doing now in the link 2000s the band had kind of a lineup change and I got excited to see where they would take their next album the duo now featured an owl on bass and vocals and ml a Moe's drummer for the band Grails and the first LP they made together I didn't love it but I could definitely see an improvement therefore sure the drums were a lot more detailed and Emmel as well as the guest musicians on this LP helped bring out those world music influences that always seem to be ever so subtly kind of influencing ohm's vibe on god is good you had a lot of flutes cellos Tambora drones the band was really expanding their sonic palette and it made me appreciate the hypnotic approach that they took the music so much more the vocals still were not really doing much for me the bass lines to me were still pretty mad but the extra instrumentation was well placed the production was good and listening to own jam for 10 or more minutes was sounding pretty good at this point and with this new LP ohm basically looks to continue expanding those international flavours in their music you have these Arabic melodies coming through on hello you have chance and just droning and repetitive bass lines contributing again to that hypnotic feel that always shoots for and another man whose name I'm about to butcher Robert ie key Aubrey Lowe who was on owns last LP just doing extra instrumentation is now on this album as a full-time member and he again is bringing that additional percussion the keys those Tambora drones has definitely progressed past their last LP I admire that they don't want to keep putting out the same album over and over and over but there are still things that seem to kind of be in the band's foundation that continue to bug me on this album owls vocals I really don't see the point in singing this way it just seems so campy it just seems so fake and just unappealing it really takes me out of the vibe of the music the bass lines to me are still pretty unimaginative but for the most part the bass the tone of the bass is great except on the second track where you do get some distortion on the bass and for some reason whatever distortion pedal they're using the low end of the bass gets totally cut out it's really muddy a distortion that doesn't sound good at all but aside from just the the lack of adventurous instrumentation though the instrumentation does sound good and is well produced the final nail in the coffin for this album for me is that the vibe of all of it is very very weak they certainly try you know the opening track on here is decked out with a guest female vocalist singing these chants in a different language you've got that extra hand percussion too but the entire song just feels like it is trying to get by on the Kitsch of sounding like it's coming from another country not really being all that interesting musically itself when Gorm's isn't giving me vocals I don't like or bass lines that I'm never going to remember they're just kind of creating this character of this music from another culture in this really long form Jam style delivery that I would like a lot more if if those things were kind of remedied so I'm really on the fence with this LP and continue to be with with all of ohms catalog I didn't really hear anything that is horrible on this album but I can't really find anything to celebrate either I'm really feeling like a strong five to a light six on this album what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next remember the good

zFg1j6oSiBo,hello hello hello everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for he review passion pit gossamer this is the sophomore LP from this Massachusetts indie pop sensation that hit it relatively big in 2008-2009 with a handful of very popular singles that managed to make it onto their debut full-length manors and that LP overall featured a lot of dance beats really prominent synthesizers sweet songwriting catchy hooks and a really strong falsetto vocal coming from frontman Michael Angelico's and to be completely honest I never really got into this LP never really quite got this album for one I just thought there was so much indie pop released that year that that was more enjoyable like from st. Vincent the panes being pure at heart girls Phoenix and and Mika Chu and in comparison with those artists even Phoenix to me Passion Pit feels just way too just friendly I just don't feel like Passion Pit was offering me much in the way of adventure I do feel like the band was kind of ambitious with some of its instrumentation and how they composed instruments around their pop songs I also liked how they would experiment a bit with vocal samples in their tracks too but the really ultra sweet attitude and the whoa-ohh choruses just kind of killed it for me and you know I'm not against happy music I'm really not if it comes off feeling kind of natural or organic but this LP and just passion pit in general to me just has the feeling of just forcing happiness as hard as possible it's like a happiness dictatorship or just like being in a cult where every single member is staring at you like see it gets creepy after a while and to be honest on manners Angelico's fall said it was really grading on my ears there are so many points on this LP where he just does not feel in control of his falsetto vocal and yet he continues to sing in that register even though he's kind of weaving in and out of pitch I just don't really get much from him as a vocalist but I still do admire the band's unrelenting devotion to all sounds sugary it's playful music and I do like playful music but but I can't help but feel like Passion Pit does not want to play as rough as I usually like to now on gossamer passion pit is really searching for and finding new ways to take their usually giddy sound and style and elevating it to just astronomical levels there's just way more space sounds and just sighs overall with the music on this LP it's just a really gargantuan presentation with very vivid colors pushing play on this thing is like getting instantaneously teleported to Teletubby land with cotton candy clouds and then the smiling baby Sun everything is there and it's not really the songs I have a huge issue with it's the aesthetic because for the most part the songs on here can be pretty good well composed well written for one the song love is greed is a really catchy song and it has a kind of cleverness to the lyrics there's a nice structure to this song and a lot of other songs on this LP which gives every track a really nice momentum it has its highs it has its lows however I feel like I could get into some of these tracks so much easier if so many of them were not performed with this chorus vocal style that just has the the vapid positivity of like a Christian after-school special produced in the 90s but I guess there is a somewhat interesting juxtaposition happening on nearly every single one of these songs you do get in upbeat sound from the music and from the vocal delivery - but the lyrics themselves a lot of times can display some really personal and emotional suffering in a way I guess it's great that Angelico's can take something sad and kind of find a silver lining in and make enough beat track about it but there are some parts where I feel like passion pits really sweet musical style makes some of the sadder emotions on this LP feel kind of ridiculous like the buildup on the bridge with song carried away we've all got something to say at about that point I imagine somebody cueing the dancing animals and smiling flowers however there are some parts on this LP where things are slightly toned-down and it makes the songs so much more palatable like a song constant conversation which is kind of the slow jam on this LP I really like the groove and the closer on the song is actually I think the only legitimate ly sad sounding track on this album that is matched pretty well with it's sadder but on on my way on the hook has a wonderful chord progression that to me shows that with this album Passion Pit has become musically a little more refined and I feel like the falsetto vocals on this album have become a little bit more refined - they're better performed on this album there's more pitch control on them as well I can appreciate improvement like that as well as the instrumental flourishes that I think are very colorful throughout these songs - but still as catchy and as melodic as some of these songs can be I just don't connect with a lot of them emotionally I just find the the attitude the upbeat attitude on this album to be incredibly unrealistic even if there is a morsel of sadness kind of coloring the background of it so overall as I listen to it again and again I did end up liking this LP though not a lot kind of feeling a decent - strong six on this LP I know a lot of you guys are crazy for this album so let me know what you think it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next remember the good comment and the great rate but only the strong subscribe passion pit gossamer forever [Music] [Music] 
5WlRFlH5oRI,nothing stays the same nothing hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music and it's time for a review knock mystia silencing machine this is an illinois band that has been added for quite a few years released quite a few LPS and they pretty much have a rotating cast of band members that is fronted by the main brain of the group Blake Judd a.k.a centrist why the ominous stage name well not miss tiem is a metal band one that is hugely influenced by the strain of black metal that was coming out of places like Norway in the 90s groups such as darkthrone Gorgoroth mayhem and influence shows in the band's retched style vocals the lo-fi production on their earlier releases and of course the chord progressions that they choose to play with - but in the late 2000s the band started experimenting a bit more with the sounds of black metal including instrumentation that was not exactly considered kosher for this style like saxophone in their records they have even incorporated elements of industrial music psychedelic rock - and the band's creative approach has been met with much positivity from fans and critics alike especially when it comes to the band's 2006 LP instinct decay and the band continues to define themselves with their less than cult approach with subsequent albums which they have named in volumes such as black metal part 1 & 2 metal being any ddle as if you are meddling with something in this case the original blueprint of black metal making the titles on albums like these the cutest play on words in the whole genre of black metal now unless you've been living under a you already know that adventurous and American offshoots of the black metal style have been pretty popular as of late in independent music we're not miss diem fits in the current spectrum of of American black metal to me despite being pretty experimental the band is incredibly no-bullshit yes there's a lot of sound effects and instrumentation on this LP that you would not normally find on a black metal album but it's incorporated so subtly to the point where it's really the band's energy production force and just really melodic and catchy songwriting that that steals the show which to me makes knock miss diem not just a black metal band but a band that just writes really solid songs under a black metal guys for example the harmonized guitar solos and just the really massive epic and emotional riffs on the end of lepers of destitution would sound great finishing off a rock song of any breed and the changes the band makes to the track over the course of its eight minutes really justifies that length and I love the really robotic vocal effects that are on that track as well seems like something that would not work on paper in this style of metal but here in a first hand it works in black metal or not no matter what way you slice it the song borrowed hope and broken dreams extremely catchy song a really dark and moody track that skips on the blast beats and instead emphasizes these really melodic guitar leads some tortured chords and a zany synthesizer that that feels kind of weird but doesn't really take away from the overall attitude of the song tracks like I wait in Hell give me the grave and reduced to ashes are extremely catchy too and that reduced to ashes track really reminds me of why I love black metal because that song is just filled with chords that that really call back to that romance era kind of composition and of course it's mixed together with this really Ross these dark just disgusting vocals I just love that mix of beauty and horror that black metal when it's great brands there's a nice variety among these tracks too you have your faster tracks you have your mid paced tracks and of course you have your really kind of slow bellowing more atmospheric tracks that really go for a big presentation it would have out a hitch the tracks on here have distinct hooks and the chord progressions a lot of weird sound effects on some of these tracks - they're really grabbed my attention a lot like the title track that has these panning effects on the drums that really give you know just a just a unique flavor to the song there's some tracks that stand out for their instrumentation like the closer which I think has a glockenspiel on it there's just a very pretty twinkly melody on that track that I like a lot and there's an array of synth textures too on these songs the only gripes that I have is that sometimes the experimentation on this LP goes a little bit too far to the point where a track and kind of feel ridiculous like on the song decimation annihilation which has these skipping synthesizers kind of pulsating in the midst of just this black metal mess and the drum beat would feel maybe much more at home behind a polka song the trick kind of hits me as being a little distracting but I'm gonna be revisiting this LP because I think it's great and maybe it will grow on me we'll see and what's funny is that is the only song on this album that really kind of takes a slightly industrial route knock miss diem doesn't really embrace that style and in a big way on this album and it's surprising not only because that sound has shown up on previous LPS but it was even on the single that was released before this album that singled the a side and the B side actually do not make it onto this LP and they may have made a nice addition to silencing Machine another downside is that sometimes the experimentations on this thing can't be so subtle that a song can feel a bit in conspicuous a lot like the opening track which is slightly underwhelming and a little bit too basic for me considering that there are so many songs after it especially in the middle and the end of this album that are so awesome and just unique so overall for me this LP is well written it's memorable it's creative things outside the torture chamber as it were uniquely hooky for a black metal album and and very melodic for me a lot like that Agalloch an album marrow of the spirit incredibly easy to get into but there's enough going on enough detail that revisiting this LP is worth it kind of feeling a decent - strong 8 on this album what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hey why and what should I review next remember the good comment and the great rate but only the strong subscribed anthony Fantana knock miss diem forever 
eL1w_-MzMWE,Hey it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here entry into internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for track reviews where we talk about the latest in everything because i'm badass someone told me to say that and i don't think it went over very well well today's track review exists because there is a new track dropped by the experimental music outfit known as Animal Collective they have a new album announced on the way tracklist is out cover art is out the title of this thing centipede Hertz Hz Hertz I imagine it's Hertz the unit of measurement that is typically used for audio purposes in terms of cycles in this forthcoming animal collective LP is looking at a September release on Domino Records thought the band would kind of draw it out a little bit further maybe tease toward the album a bit more but September right around the corner now these guys are easily right now one of the most celebrated contemporary groups and experimental music and in neo psychedelia delia doo ba da and they have tons of hardcore fans who not only just love most of their albums but but also enjoy the side projects that have come out of Animal Collective as well now the band also came out with another single recently honeycomb with the b-side Gotham unfortunately those tracks will not be making it onto the new animal collective LP although I did review it you can find that review below very positive review great song but like I said this track review is going to focus on this new animal collective track which has been titled today's supernatural and the first thing I notice on this track the first thing I'm sure any Animal Collective fan is going to notice is just a V ter is on vocals and seems to be really kind of taking over the songwriting and the energy of this track as well something that was real kind of vacant from Meriweather post pavilion which did bring that album a different flavor made it more accessible because a bee does tend to be the more abrasive of the two major songwriting figures in Animal Collective AV tere and panda bear so Amy really brings back animal collectives wild side on this track bringing things back to a more strawberry jam kind of feel but not nearly as raw and chaotic as the stuff animal collective was putting out around that time they're still sounding pretty I guess well recorded pretty clean though this track is really in your face with a bee screaming and just a really a lot of percussion really kind of intricate Polly rhythms and the bright shops synthesizers playing these burning chords and he's zany arpeggios despite all that this track is is pretty readable and I would say pretty easy to get into I love that this track is not only in three but it really rocks hard on this 3/4 time you do get stubble and really nice manipulations of this rhythm in the background and what also kind of brings change in and progression to this track is all the weird sound effects that kind of interject as a bees versus switch from one to another and of course there are all these strange echoes and just vocal manipulations to his voice as well that just bring another element of weird sounds this track has some intense verses and and easily one of the I guess shortest hooks to ever be on an animal collective song Animal Collective is just great at drawing up these really weird calls and chants and just making them incredibly catchy come on and I'm not 100% sure exactly what this song is about I've been reading the lyrics and maybe the subject of this song is something that we could talk about in the comments a little bit but I do feel like Animal Collective brings that same surprising level of an abstract lyricism this time around - with lines like because you're all the sweetest things and side of you what lines like that do make me tilt my head a little bit but it's a bit of a mind bender whenever I try to make sense of exactly what that could possibly mean and what's funny is that line is a bit of a mantra on this track it's actually a part of a chorus on the album so you're not only getting that as the only chorus you kind of get two choruses for the price of one if you would allow such a short weird chant to be classified as a chorus I guess and I can't really say anything else about this track I just think it's a great frigging song it's got me really excited to hear this new animal collective album like I said it kind of goes back to that strawberry jam kind of feel but with maybe a bit more refinement to it just once again Animal Collective comes forward with a track that has personality interesting structure strange unique sound effects swirling around the instrumentation itself and lots of personality which comes mainly from a visa vocals which I will say are freaking great on this track he just has such a guess an aggressive punk rock esque kind of spirit feeling a little bit of love for this track I can't wait to kind of listen to it more up to the point when I finally get to sink my teeth into this new animal collective LP but what did you guys think of this track did you love it did you hate it why what are you expecting from this new animal collective LP and what do you think I should review next remember the great weight and the the good comment but only the strong subscribe Anthony Fantana Animal Collective forever 
CTTmj5V5h_M,hey everybody I want to say good luck to America in the 2012 Olympics u.s.a u.s.a hey hey hey hey hi everyone Anthony Pham tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Rick Ross God forgives I don't this is the latest full-length LP from Florida gangsta rapper Rick Ross he's been added since the early 2000s it seems he's put out a handful of albums since and the most popular of all of them so far has been his last album that he put out a couple years ago Teflon Don which really rocketed him to a new level of popularity and helped him establish the new Maybach Music Group rap clique that he currently runs with right now up there with Young Money and and good music Maybach is is one of the three most powerful I guess movements you could say in hip-hop right now now as far as Ross's instrumental style the beats that he rides on typically in his songs he can switch back and forth pretty easily from these really glitzy glamorous beats that may sample a lot of smooth jazz or R&B and he does pretty well on these like southern style trunk knocking trap beats - he throws out a lot of basic flows a lot of basic rhymes relies more on the huskiness of his voice to get his point across and for the most part it works but still album after album that lack of great storytelling and lyricism kind of continues to haunt him with with hip-hop fans and critics he really does tend to be one of those guys that when you hear him it's cool but when you listen to him it tends to get a little shaky and I would say that honestly from from Teflon Don not a lot has changed with Ross on on this new album other than that you know things maybe seem to be a little bit more glamorous he's backed up a bit more by people who are affiliated with Maybach he continues to work the the gangster-rap tag on this new album but does not approach it as usual from the point of view of a street thug ross likes to throw out a lot of money raps a lot of narratives about major drug deals and then organized crime circuits at which he sits at the top it's got kind of a mafioso flavor to it that you can like him back to album such as Raekwon's only built 4 Cuban Linx jay-z's reasonable doubt American Gangster and of course one of my favorite albums in in this sub-genre of gangster rap Ghostface Killah 's fish-scale in my opinion rick ross is the least interesting rapper right now to be approaching gangsta rap at this angle according to the pictures and the stories that he paints being a drug lord is incredibly boring and that's because Ross's descriptions and his stories never have any tension progression or depth imagine Scarface the movie Scarface imagine that movie edited down to only the scenes where Al Pacino is rich getting laid doing well partying and getting coked up and it's just two hours of that and then it ends and that's it if you subtract all the moments where an Al's character is coming to power and and falling off his throne you get a boring movie and you get a boring character and when you repeat the strategy year you get a boring album on this LP Ross really has nothing else to talk about other than how on top he is and he does so lazily you kind of have to wonder how did he get on top in the first place on the opening track on your pirates Ross kind of paints himself as being this ruthless drug-dealing mobster he leads a life of crime and yet is kind of conflicted with his personal religious beliefs he painted this same portrait on Teflon Don I like the heavy eat on this track I like the Moody horns on the song too overall it's a pretty great track it's a good self-portrait of Ross's character but where does he go from here the track three kings featuring dr. Dre and Jay Z comes right after and it's just like one bad verse after another dr. Dre plugs his headphone line twice Ross has the shortest verse on here again just more references to his money to his drug overlord power and jay-z kind of comes in with the glitzy glamour II thing that was not all that interesting to listen to on watch the throne but with more references to his baby Jay does still have some clever lines he can still be funny but it's not so interesting that I want to listen to the track again the song actually fizzle down a pretty embarrassing way to the song machine comes right after that track and I like the instrumental way better on that song I love the soulful vocal sample on that track sounds really nice and I love the groove of the beat to a very nice smooth R&B sample on this track but Rick Ross comes again with another basic flow about his money and just his superiority in the drug dealing game you get some friction in this track and in other tracks whether it's against other drug dealers whether it's against Rick Ross's past where he talks about being poorer or against some kind of inner remorse about being a drug dealer but all of this stuff that that could be really important to learning about Rick Ross's character are just treated like minor footnotes that don't really matter and most people are probably not even reading into and because all these things that could make an interesting storyline are kind of just thrown in the shadows you get a really redundant narrative from Ross on not just this album but every album at this point the album is kind of teetering for me and Ross really starts to close the coffin up on Maybach Music for where there is a wack R&B hook on the song and right after that 16 comes with it pretty underwhelming Andre 3000 verse and the worst the worst guitar solo on any album of 2012 closing the song out and to go further into the track 16 there is an intro on the song where Ross is I don't know talking about having difficulty just like depicting his life depicting the reality of it fitting in into 16 bars he just kind of gives me the impression that he's going to tell me something really real and just really gets something off of his chest and I hate moments where Ross breaks the fourth wall like that because let's be honest there's nothing real about Rick Ross's character he's not a drug kingpin he's not moving Keys he's not whipping chickens if you're gonna pretend then pretend don't act like it's real they're just so many moments for this album is so delusional I can barely stand it after this point in the album tracks like hold me back and 911 take a more southern flavor with the instrumentals and man 911 lost me and hold me back was just annoyingly repetitive I do want to hold me back he's just trying to reach this walk a level of intensity and he doesn't sound all that good doing it and it's kind of sad because this style of stuff is what sounded so good and the catchiest on Teflon Don with tracks like blown money fast but even the singles on here like so sophisticated I don't feel reach that level of of entertainment after Ross kind of goes into a trap style stint on the tracks with this LP he hits a bunch of just bad slow jams and the worst of all of them is the song touching you which features uh sure the beat is just an absolute mess uh sure is so much louder than Ross on this track for some reason and I wish the hook was touching you like the title says but it's actually fucking yeah and that is looped over and over in a really lazy way and the truth is the last person I ever want to imagine in the midst of some kind of sexual caper is is Rick Ross and I can't really take any tracks in this style that he does seriously because all of his love songs come from down here and on numerous rhymes he readily admits that he pretty much would not really be getting laid if it were not for the fact that he has so much money and who wants to be that guy the final track on here the Justice League produced ten Jesus pieces I feel like is one of the better songs on this LP it's a good closer Staley is on the last verse it's a decent track if I don't really I guess analyze the the shallowness of it and Ross rapping about blood diamonds being in his chains it's kind of weird because the song does sound pretty good because Ross does feel impassioned on the track but it's just weird that you have to have him put a song about his chains on an album for him to really sound like he's putting a good vibe together I love this smooth sax solos on that instrumental I love the way the kick drum on that instrumental grooves but everything that came before is just so unforgettably oh there are some hits here and there on this LP but for the most part this album is just boring flows uninspired fantasies the same old story from Ross told with the same shallowness and in lack of detail as he tells a series of stories about the money he doesn't make from all the drugs he doesn't move I know Rick Ross is not making smart music I know he's not trying to I know that not everything needs to be this big deep thought-provoking thing but I do think Rick Ross is trying to make entertaining music and and this isn't even that this album is just another slew of hip-hop stereotypes but maybe with a little bit more glamour a little bit more excess with some unimpressive mic skills and a series of instrumentals that can be kind of hit or miss really feeling a strong to to a light three on this album and that's all I can say what did you guys think of it did you love it why and what should I review next remember the good comment and the great rate but only the strong subscribe Anthony Fantana Rick Ross forever 
2c-G1oHPg9U,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd doing a or starting a video series unedited that has been kind of highly requested by a lot of you that I show you my vinyl collection I plan on doing this in a series of just sort of ten minute segments whenever we hit ten minutes as I'm going through the vinyl I'm just going to go through alphabetical order sort of stopping and talking about certain records whether they have a certain special significance to me or have some interesting packaging and when we hit ten minutes we're just going to stop and then I'll do another segment sort of going further through the collection now keep in mind I have a lot of CDs - I have CDs down there as well and I have a ton of copies of albums on digital you know digital mp3s so this is not all of my music so you know don't ask me something like why do you only have that one terrible record from that one band er why do you only have two I have other albums they're just not all in vile so let's begin ten minutes all right to start I have two records hi-tech heurists as well as 93 million miles from sort of the experimental African electronic outfit Africa hi-tech nothing really special to say about the packaging other than it's sort of two LPs you know two 12-inch LPS in in both releases actually I think this one has this one has four no three this one is three this is something three yeah this one is three twelve inches inside of it nothing really amazing about how their sleeve door or anything like that you know you guys have seen you review this moving on let's see what we have next we have Andrew Jackson jihads knife man another album I have reviewed on the channel love this LP you can see that from my review it believe there's anything amazingly crazy about the package oh I do get a little bit of a extended poster of the I guess it'd be a the album cover itself you know the vinyl I guess labeling on the record itself knife man as the cool Andrew Jackson jihad logo please well plays nice I just put these down here moving forward everybody loves this album hey I didn't tell you guys my girlfriend's on the camera right now she is womaning the camera I'm not gonna say Manning the camera because that's semi sexist right yeah probably okay so I mean you know going forward got that Merriweather Post Pavilion on vinyl nice nice double LP sleeving for this particular record and kula yeah they've got the other Domino Records you know logo thing there I don't know if you want to get a close-up on that get it looking all fancy schmancy and nice that all focused and sexy looking ooh got the mirror weather Post Pavilion on vinyl like I said nice packaging but not really my favorite packaging in the world I mean it's it's all about seeing this album cover in person after it having made you dizzy looking at it on the internet but it is actually a lot less intense of a optical illusion when you're looking at it like right in front of your face unfortunately a next record and albatrosses we are the laser Viking look at this album if you can like I wouldn't even call it an album it's it's quite literally like I think a 10 or 11 minute 12-inch comes with a really cool laser Viking poster I've got shoved in there lyrics on one side and if I'm correct I even listen to this mile it's blue yes it is blue and it's actually just a one sided LP this site has nothing whatsoever on it because the full 11 minutes that this thing lasts is all on here and I mean if if you're looking for some really spastic hardcore abrasive and just fast and brief like music then this is this is definitely a great listen sadly I did not enjoy much of what the band put out after this release but this is this is a great little 12-inch I I bought a lot of things and then sold them you know over the years and that is one thing that's just never left my collection you guys know this review this recently Fiona Apple the either real is wiser than the driver of the screw and whipping chords will show me more of the ropes will ever do great LP you guys have seen my my review for it and the only thing that is awesome aside from the very thick LP vinyl pressing on this album the other thing that I think is amazing about the album art is that when you get it you get this amazing I want to close-up on that amazing child photo of Fiona Apple on the piano such a happy kid playing that piano is that look good honey it's not look good oh yeah Wow yeah we were just burning through these knots all right classic punk album DC punk band there's nothing really amazing about the packaging other than there being a really nice because this is a reissue if I am correct there is a quote from nope I'm totally wrong but there is a quote on the back but not from the person who I thought it was from I must have read that quote somewhere else but I thought I was reading a quote from like one of the Beastie Boys member who one of the Beastie Boys members who had said something about them but classic punk album do buy a copy of this if you are at all interested in punk music you know nice record sleeve labeling oh don't want to wreck it okay battles freakin one of my favorite albums one of my favorite contemporary albums I love the goo packaging on this thing this is really one of my favorite records of the year it even kind of comes with a poster insert I believe nice labeling on every record comes with a poster insert of pinkness with more goo there's just this thing is just loaded with goo and as I have showed you before in another one of my reviews if I'm correct of course all of the vinyl copies of the remix series that they came out with I mean my girlfriend's smiling at me on the other side of the camera like I usually do not do collector stuff like that but I did I did at that point all right Beastie Boys compilation here a lot of fantastic hits and songs on this thing endless summer if you want to get into the Beach Boys but you're lazy and you see a vinyl copy of this somewhere for cheap and I can't imagine they would run very expensive because this is a pretty common a little compilation I believe you know get this get Pet Sounds you know just start as a starter kit starter kit for the peach points the the vinyl I believe isn't pretty you know the vinyl and everything it's in good shape yeah it's in good shape I always check out you know the records before I'm buying them like always make sure is it dusty is it scratched you know are there finger prints on it you know pay pay very close attention to that stuff because it's gonna keep it from playing back nicely and and this is very clean very shiny considering uh when it was pressed so you know don't always think that records are just old dusty broken things if you take care of them they're not going to get like that all right each house devotion my girlfriend I love this album we love this album mm-hmm you love this album definitely my favorite Beach House LP the gatefold on this I love Gate folds is nice I like the you know little quirky letters pulled together to do all the to do all of the a titling for the for the songs on here let me see hmm just checking the time weird is not speeding through this buzz got all the - all the time in the world to do these videos Beastie Boys hot sauce committee part - I really love this album on first listen I didn't cool down on it over time but it's still very nice pressing I like oh yes I forgot about this comes on white vinyl comes on white vinyl I love the UH the labeling on the UH on the record really goes along to the front and this thing actually came with oh and I love the UH you sort of have all these characters of people on there you have Arthur Ashe s claws the captain as well as Mike D bonus MC a rest in peace MC a and what's awesome is you have all the lyrics right now on this album in colors that correspond with every MC on the LP so MCAS verse are one color Mike DS verse or another verses are another color so I actually like that a lot about the packaging of course there are more characters on the other on the other vinyl LP as well as in the middle and there is a shirt iron on that came with this that I have not applied to a shirt maybe one day when I'm feeling bold I'll apply this to a t-shirt alright let's make sure I don't take down the shelving here Beatles Abbey Road how can you go wrong geez get a copy of this and mine is obviously you know not glued together like it should be but the record itself has been very clean fantastic condition um there we got looks nice the original Apple logo right there browning of the of the sleeve fantastic record I mean really one of my favorites from the Beatles goddamn I mean I don't think I need to tell anybody who the Beatles are but how great this album is why but that's in my collection and this hello this album even more than Abbey Road The White Album um I'm not exactly sure oh no timer done timer done all right looks like you got to close this out just as we get to the White Album we're still in the bees I'm gonna do another penny or so a week or so from now

from there on in so see you again soon in front of the records Anthony Fantana Records forever [Music] 
J6xkvLGQbAU,arm hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review guardian alien see the world given to a one love entity if I am correct this is the Brooklyn band's sophomore LP and their first for thrill jockey records and the reason this project caught my attention is because Greg Fox drummer who you may know from the band liturgy is in this group it's pretty unfortunate that recently Greg had to leave the van liturgy because I guess he wanted to focus on other projects I guess I could understand because he would most definitely mean all the concentration he could muster for this new LP which is essentially 137 minute song what you are going to find on this LP is some pretty progressive strange and and forward-thinking psychedelic rock which features some pretty strong musicianship especially from Greg whose drums are just relentless he brings a lot of the same very fluid intense rolls and fills that made that last literally record such a freaking experience at the very start of this piece it is pretty much a vast atmosphere of guitar freak-outs very metallic drones which sound like they could be coming from a guitar a sitar maybe even a sound bowl or two and there's even some very kind of pleasant chanting in a female voice which throughout the course of this track is being altered sometimes subtly and sometimes not so subtly by a load of effects and though it seems like guardian alien has written some parts out has planned some parts out once I got to about three minutes into this thing it became kind of apparent that in a lot of ways this thing is a jam as I was listening to this one song several things we're going to my mind one I wish the guitars were I guess you know throwing out as much salty as much improvisation and as many interesting ideas as the vocals and the drums were they were really kind of maybe a little too repetitive for me as these guys were jamming out through this track another thing is that the sounds on this album are so friggin good the production is just stellar the sounds are so lush they're just almost kind of tangible the drone on this thing though it does get a little monotonous as the song drags on it is a nice nice drone and pretty much all the instrumentation even as these guys get very chaotic very psychedelic it's very well-balanced very well mixed after the intro the first notable change to me on this song is it about the nine-minute mark the chanting at this point in the song eases up a little bit the guitars are playing different phrases you're getting some extra and different drum fills here and there but keep in mind at this point in the song and throughout this entire track lead drone and just the song in general is in the same key another great change that comes through on this album even though I wish it happened earlier is about the 13 minute mark where the drums break away and once they come back you get them playing in a different time signature and I like that a lot the vocals follow suit and the drone starts to get thickened up with more guitar layers and violin to my least favorite part easily comes at about the 19-minute mark we're all the instrumentation for the most part breaks away and the drone you just get the quiet ambience of the drone which would be cool because there are some points where it gets pretty heavy lots of low-end comes in but all of these field recordings pouring right after and it kind of sounds like they were recorded at the shore you kind of get the ocean lapping against the beach you're getting a little wind noise blowing it to the microphone and there is what kind of sounds like a seagull just incessantly yeah hey I mean to be completely honest the animal sounds don't really add to the moody and very weighty jiron going on behind them it's just kind of distracting and kind of takes me out of the moment I guess the drone lasts about six minutes but right after the instrumentation comes back in and it is very different from what has been going out prior in this song even though it is still in the same key Greg Fox and company really started jamming and rocking on this drone hitting a very very nice groove with some notable intensity something I wish they were doing much earlier past the intro on this thing and that's pretty much a rundown of the experience that I had with this 37 minute track I felt like the performance just the altogether interplay of this thing could have been a bit more intense but I do feel like I came out of this thing with with slightly more pros than cons the instrumentation on this thing is pretty varied and great the recording is stellar I do like the style that these guys are presenting and I think for the most part especially with the track length here they're being pretty ambitious and I did like most the ideas that they presented throughout this Jam I just feel like they structured this one song in such a way where these ideas feel to say me say me to be exciting whenever you're presented with with a new one I guess so overall I do kind of feel like a decent too strong six on this LP definitely not a favorite of mine for the year but don't don't just pass this up because I didn't fall in love with it if you guys have listened to this thing what did you think did you like it did you hate it why what should I review next and remember the good comment and the great rate but only the strong subscribe Anthony Fantana guardian alien forever 
EgWwC0rGDzo,it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for track reviews where we talk about the latest rock pop electronic and experimental music as well as maybe some hip hop and metal from time to time of the into maybe also major label dependent persuasion and the reason I'm doing this track review is because the indeed electronic duo consisting of Alice glass and Ethan cath known as Crystal Castles as a new track out titled plague recently there has been talk with Crystal Castles of a new LP that they've been recording and over the course of time that I've been following Crystal Castles there have been some ups and some towns while I do love Crystal Castles debut LP I am slightly underwhelmed by the second and to me Crystal Castles debut album was fun it was bouncy it was just really interesting multi-layered and and multi-textured alternative indie electronic pop dance I really love the mixtures of sounds and styles on this album you do get straight dance tunes really short poppy electronic motifs as well as tracks that have more of a shoegaze direction to them - and to pull all of these things together ethan cath will drum up ethereal sounds distorted sounds 8-bit quality audio as well and of course Alice glasses vocals do have a lot to offer to the album - while I don't think she is the greatest vocalist in a traditional sense I do think that she has a lot of personality on a lot of tracks between Crystal Castles first and second LP you'll catch her performing these very sharp girly shouted vocals that that are very attention demanding and I think her vocals can sometimes have an element of cockiness to them that I like a lot and Crystal Castles second LP I mean I could understand it still being self-titled because to me it really feels like a continuation of the same theme except maybe a little more or find with it's tracks that having more gargantuan presentation and and one of the best singles of the year it came out 2010 not in love which featured Robert Smith of the Cure on vocals now that we have this new Crystal Castles track now I'm really kind of crossing my fingers and hoping that it leads and just builds up to an album that I love as much as the debut but after listening to this track I'm just not sure that's gonna happen the track starts off with a really the serial introduction these synthesizers are very light but have a reverb on them that makes them feel pretty panoramic and Alice glass is singing over this introduction in a pretty subdued vocal delivery I guess subdued to the point where it feels kind of anonymous and the vocal melody that she sings in this section of the song just feels very forgettable to me I like that the track has a loud soft dynamic to it it's kind of cliche I'm sure a lot of people are gonna point that out but I mean it's one of the better things this song is going for it because when the song does explode for the first time it does kind of feel at least on some level like who acts just this rush of a really sharp bright like blindingly bright synthesizers just pour in and it's a siser tone texture that that if you're a Crystal Castles fan you've heard used on previous tracks the Sinister playing a very rhythmic phrase that is cycling in a very repetitive manner some buzzing bass adds a little bit of low-end underneath that and Alice glasses vocals kind of gets swallowed and in all of this kind of like the initial tracks to drop from the last Crystal Castles album there are just some production choices that really ruin the song for me and keep me from loving it like why are Alice's vocals so buried on this song or with how just low they're mixed and how much reverb has been slapped on them this kind of sounds like a grime song but with more of an apocalyptic edge or something and it's a little frustrating because to me Alice's vocals are the only thing that are changing up and doing something different at the 150 mark in this song you have pretty much heard everything that this instrumental has to offer to you and it's five minutes long I like the textures and the sounds coming through on the very ethereal interlude around the the second third of the track but it's not so interesting that it makes me interested to hear the last section of the instrumental which is just kind of like a copy and paste job of the previous section of the instrumental I also think the song comes with a pretty obvious mood change too this is definitely one of the angsty ER and darker songs that I've heard Crystal Castles put out and while I didn't really love the execution with the production maybe a darker album from them this time around would be kind of interesting so overall I didn't really care for this track to be completely honest I probably will not be listening to it again until Crystal Castles next album finally comes out and that's it what did you guys think of this track did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next remember the good comment the great rate and only the strong subscribe Anthony Fantana Crystal Castles forever 
SerNPTbrF84,hello everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for your review purity ring shrines purity ring is a duo consisting of megan james vocalist and and i assume just on the production and this is the debut LP from this synth pop project that caused quite a stir with some ethereal adorable singles one of which belly's peak was one of my favorite singles of last year and both of those singles from 2011 have made it onto this new LP and the remaining nine tracks on this album pretty much follow the stylistic suit set by those singles now purity ring's approach to synthesizer pop is pretty familiar but still different enough to kind of be worth buzzing about without I guess kind of reading it three months from now the songs on this thing feature very heavy atmospheric slow-paced synthesizers and very spacious beats that take a lot of cues from chopped and screwed style hip hop production as well as some southern hip hop - with very kind of trap style snares and hi-hats rattling throughout a lot of these tracks but the songs overall do not come off as dark as I guess you would assume given that those two things are pretty much in every song and the reason the songs on here aren't really brooding it is Megan James voice keeps purity ring's songs from just going too deep into the abyss Megan's voice has a very kind of childlike tambour to it it feels very young feels very girly even on a more sensitive track on this album cartography Megan's voice still maintains a kind of I guess cutesy quality to it I feel like her does bring a somewhat I guess unique sound to pure earring style but is kind of a double-edged sword for me the vocals can be a little monotonous one-dimensional Meghan's range is not all that far and most of her vocal melodies tend to kind of sound very say me say me and emotionally I feel like many of her vocal deliveries on these tracks are pretty flat too very kind of disengaged and and repetitive in that way it kind of reminds me of like a JJ album and instrumentally I don't really feel like purity ring has developed its style all that well past the handful of singles that have been released before this LP the singles have the most detailed production unique melodies and catchiest hooks but it's not just that because of that one-dimensional quality that I feel like this album has listening to an entire gauntlet of songs from purity ring does feel a little boring to me it kind of reminds me of that Colts album that got released last year they had songs released prior to that LP the year before that I thought were pretty good but then sitting through an entire album of their material really just did not do it for me I'm sure they share some fans as well but I'm kind of you know digressing at this point purity ring definitely has a more original style and if we can take the the label which house seriously for one second I think they are more enjoyable and better produce than most of the artists who kind of get slapped with that pretty fashionable label I feel like there's a lot to like about the style that purity ring's has going on shrines but the execution the performance of the songs on this LP is just really underwhelming and the songwriting can be kind of hit or miss like the song fine shrine which has some very glossy since a sputtering beat that I like as well as some kind of morbid lyrics that I'm enjoying but the repetitive melodies and just the lack of added details as the song progresses just don't really sit well with me plus the song a lot of songs on here just overall feel pretty lethargic and not in an intoxicating way there are some sharp tunes on this album but just not enough to really make me like the whole thing I think overall pure d-ring really kind of values style over songs and execution I'm very on the fence with this LP kind of feeling a strong five to a light six on it did you guys like it hate it why let me know and remember the good comment the great rate and only the strong subscribe Anthony Fantana purity ring shrines forever [Music] [Music] 
mVtFxatTLgU,I still got nothing hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review nod their tongues his scatological scatology this is the netherlands-based solo project of multi-instrumentalist maurice i believe his name is pronounced and this project takes a lot of inspiration from black metal nah their tongues essentially borrows black metals trademark distortion tremolo guitar picking retched vocals blast beats as well to create some very vile sounds that are fronted with equally vile album covers hey and a lot of mother tongues tracks are built on ambien interludes instrumental interludes drones noise escapes atmosphere is very essential to the neither tongues formula which is why on so many of this projects previous LPS clear song structures kind of get thrown out the window in favor of creating something that is more like a soundtrack for a long twisted staircase down to hell the sounds on and almost any another tongue's LP are not welcoming by any means however the project looks to add depth to the ugliness on the tracks of its albums by bringing all of this extra instrumentation into the mix real horns and strings and and piano and for the most part this extra instrumentation is arranged impressively bringing some nice musical chops to the chaos now it will admit some of the stuff that comes out of this project can get kind of campy whether it be like the sound effect of chains rattling or people choking or tormented screams ultimately what you were going to hear with a na their tongues release is something that is authentically disturbing now over the years and other tongues has proved itself to be a pretty prolific project releasing sometimes three albums in one year now maybe a scatological scatology is not neither tongues most fear inducing moment on record but i do think it's kind of their most accessible relatively now stylistically this LP feels way more straightforward than most nah their tongues releases really relying on much more of a metal momentum to get things kind of moving they're a lot more blast beats on this LP while there are still a lot of noisy and avant-garde and some I guess noise scape moments on this LP I think this album presents a change that hardcore fans are pretty much going to perceive as being just straight-up black metal and I think the upside to this change that is going on with this LP is that now their tongues is is definitely more of an assault on the ears and it's an assault with very little relief it's not like the the very ugly tension on this album builds up to a catchy climax or really memorable melody or anything like that there's no happy ending to this thing this album's measure of success is basically in forcing you to watch the world burn just kind of take a break stop and smell the corpses does any specific moment on this album do that better than any other moment I can't really say and that's mostly because the level of neurosis on the music from this album is just so watertight when I listen to these tracks which can number from four to ten minutes I do get a nice sense of progression I'm not getting all too much repetition nothing really drags on too long even though everything is is slathered in a very similarly filthy distortion for example the opening track on here starts just full blast guitars with blast beats coming from the drums dissonant guitar arpeggios from there kind of moves into even harsher walls of distortion and from there a very kind of chromatic bass line up against just this never-ending wall of strings layered on top of each other wailing into oblivion I mean all in all I feel like this album reaches such an extreme if you do enjoy it on the first track most likely you're going to listen through this thing and just like it if this album turns you off from the get-go I'm not really gonna push you and tell you hey you really should try out the rest of it though I will say I do feel like the one downside to the more abrasive approach that neither tongue has taken on this LP is that with previous albums you got more of a variety of horrifying sounds at a variety of volumes this on the other hand shoots for something much more claustrophobic and suffocating and while it is pretty exciting at first to just be pummeled relentlessly I did kind of feel myself after a handful of lessons becoming kind of calloused to it to it this is a decent too strong seven for me what did you guys think of it did you love it hate it why look let me know remember good comment the great rate and only the strong subscribe Anthony Fantana nah their tongues forever 
sjZJoRTOKr0,I've got nothing I've got nothing hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review tonight self titled tonight EP tonight is the collaborative project of two up-and-coming electronic music producers from the UK Hudson Mohawke and Lunas I am much more at a bit of an edited I am much more familiar with the former than the latter and the five tracks on this EP are pretty much a mixture of I want to say trap rapped style hip hop instrumentals combined with some pretty recent strains of electronic dance music including future garage and dubstep and these styles are mixed together with the kind of unapologetic audacity that you would expect from somebody who is producing music like far into the future this EP really has no sense of oh these things are separate they should be separated they're different and that's part of the reason I love the internet because when a new sound or style kind of comes out of the blue comes out of nowhere before it even really gets a complete chance to really root itself into a single geographical area or culture everybody around the world is experimenting with it and really weird fusions and experiments can happen and turn into snowballing trends before people or critics really get the opportunity to stomp out the fire and start wagging their fingers screening gimmick gimmick so this is a pretty short EP is five tracks one after another it's just straight bangers bangers burners when I say the beats on this EP bang I mean it this is probably going to be the most hyped up 2012 based music you've heard there's not a single song on this EP that I could sit through sitting still to go back to the musical influences on this thing the trap rap hip-hop style is definitely the most prominent of all of them you do get the kinds of build ups and drops that you would expect from light a waka flocka flame beat or something like that you get those rattling high hats and snare drums that are just relentless at some points on this thing but some of the drops on this EP do have kind of a dubstep flavor to them and a few tracks on here kind of feature the very relentless vocal sample repetitions that you would expect more from an electronic music production coming from the UK which of course is rooted back in Juke and ghetto house if I have to have the lineage spelled out for me one more time I'm going to throw up in my mouth and have to swallow it because throwing up on camera is gross but on the track higher ground I really love how the vocal repetitions on that track are executed they are just so unrelenting it may be the most obnoxious thing you have ever heard for some people but for me it just really adds to the the energy of the track and the bass kicks on on this track and and others on this EP have very bold and clear hip-hop style to them as well the low-end on this EP is stellar you are doing yourself no favors by listening to this through like some earbuds or are just laptop speakers get a system you will most likely be able to pull out the influences that build the songs on this EP very easily what makes these guys different from other producers working with similar hybrids is how zany and just insane the colors and and samples and textures are that these guys work with on on this EP this is almost like psychedelic neon colored trap rap instrumentals the track buggin has really hard beats but they are slathered in reverb and they're like samples of this baby playing throughout the track going there all these bubbles popping in the beat too of course the scents are really weird there are all sorts of heavy the size was on the track higher ground to that I like a lot that sound like party horns burnt my remember and the track easy-easy has a load of weird crap mixed into the beat one sample kind of sounds like a car crashing which is played over and over I kind of hear a gun cocking these high-pitched vocal samples that sort of interject occasionally going yeah there are a lot of strange textures and samples on this EP but Hudson Mohawke and Lunas just take these sounds and they chop them loop them manipulate them with such an attention to detail how could the production shops on this EP not be recognized these tracks on this EP really do kind of appeal to those two sides of my brain and I love music like that that really not only just makes me react emotionally very quickly but I can also just sit back and think oh hmm derp derp hmm derp and there is a nice range of variation between these five tracks as well not only in terms of mood but in terms of just I guess style and sound some tracks rely more on vocal samples others just the beat and some synthesizers their moments like the first track that are pretty atmospheric and kind of Moody while others are very playful flamboyant experimental and just all-around engaging though this EP is short to me it is very satisfying I wish the first track were longer but that's really the only major issue I have with it I personally think it is very awesome and refreshing to hear electronic music like this that takes on such a heavy hip-hop influence and is so well produced but does not take itself too seriously it's just this really fun and catchy brand of neon colored aggression that I like a lot I'm feeling a light too decent 9 on this EP what do you think of it you have heard it love it hate it why let me know remember the good comment the great rate and only the strong subscribe tonight self-titled EP rapper [Music] 
KK8243vkLQ8,there's no point in you listening to the hip-hop's because you're not going to fully appreciate it that's where god damned dick ulis hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a quick little album review Mission of Burma unsound this is the latest LP from Boston an experimental rock and post-punk outfit Mission of Burma a group whose early stuff I love to death more often than not when someone approaches me and asks me what some of my favorite albums of all time are I definitely make sure to name-drop verses and signals calls and March yes why are these releases some of my favorites ever back in the day Mission of Burma had a lot of energy some real Punk spirit but they were very heady band as well very cerebral with how they would experiment with their to their songs they would fuss with a weird time to signature or a strange groove or some syncopation and a track they would load a song with weird sound effects and and tape loops thanks to the help of Martin Swope kind of the fourth member of the group who pretty much would do his thing offstage or just add kind of strange sounds along with the band in post-production certainly for their time these guys were very unique very bold very weird but they wrote songs that were accessible that were kind of catchy loaded with fresh sounds that would just stick upon first contact sadly the band really only thrived for about four years the band's guitarist and Co frontman coast songwriter Roger Miller had tinnitus he kind of had to bow out ohayo I but 19 years later they kind of came back with a vengeance started touring again got on Matador records started putting out albums again that were pretty well received by critics by fans and and by people who were hearing about them for the first time - but as happy as I am that the band got back together when it comes to the first two full-length LPS that these guys are released after their hiatus I mean I kind of feel like I'm in bizarro world a little bit because of how well-received they were and I was not hot on them at all especially on the LP on off on which to me was was really kind of clean and and overproduced for these guys and I was kind of finding less strange sound effects on these records to just less mind-bending moments in 2009 the band came out with the sound the speed the light and I actually liked this record quite a bit the band changed their production it sounds like they are recording in the in the same manner they were back in the 80s with this record I saw Mission of Burma kind of not only embracing their older sound but continuing to advance it and experiment with it as if the hiatus had never happened now on this new LP Mission of Burma continues to kind of perform their tracks in the raw really letting that interplay flow and letting the the chaos occur much in the same way that the band did on their live LP but of course they have a more focused studio sound to it this thing is 34 tracks 11 minutes long and it opens up at the track dust-devil which opens up with this really weird groove roger miller singing front and center and it is pretty much just classic burma rogers guitar freak-outs are all over the place peter Prescott's drums are just frantic very nutty fills his playing is is very intense and sometimes unpredictable I don't feel like this is one of the Bands best songs the next track semi pseudo sort of plan has a classic Burma feel to it too but Clint is fronting this track and if you've never heard this band before you'll kind of get a grip of the two songwriting styles of Roger Miller and Clint Connolly on this particular track yeah it is catchy er it is easier on the ears and it's because he has the tendency to write songs that are more anthemic and approachable and that's the dynamic that they kind of have been switching back and forth between for years but this is the first LP where I feel like they're really kind of toy with that dynamic and break it a bit because during the songwriting process this album were really the performance process the recording process of this album instruments were switched and members had to write songs on something they weren't necessarily comfortable with of course I wasn't there for the recording of this album but if there is at least one song that I would bet was performed in this way it is sectionals and mourning the guitars the bass the vocals are there but they do not seem to be I guess sort of played in the way that you would expect for a mission of Burma especially the guitars which are just kind of like laying on these sliding leads so there are some moments where the band is is noticeably stepping outside of their comfort zone like the song add in unison which has these like descending blues rock guitar leads that does sound like they could have been out of classic rock tunes there's also a trumpet on the end of that track and multi-layered trumpets on the track after that as well I think the trumpet is and could be a great addition to mission of Burma's music but I feel like mixed wives they weren't blended in all that well for the most part this album keeps me engaged sonically especially on tracks like hi-fi where the band kind of satirizes people who kind of in take most of their their media I guess via really tiny screens or very tiny laptop speakers where everything kind of either looks or just sounds like crap meanwhile there's a lead vocal over this singing through what seems like the speaker on a cell phone it's kind of annoying but it's obviously what the band going for and as the track progresses they just start freaking out just laying on these really just hard hard riffs screaming this is i-5 and Bob Weston of shellac who in this new incarnation of Burma has replaced Martin's suave as the effects guide of tape and loops guy really proves his worth on this track and lays a load of stones into this song that that enhanced the chaos there were some negatives on the selfie for me for sure for one I do feel like there are a good series of songs on here that are either underwhelming or pretty forgettable and I would say forgettable because they've pretty much already written songs that sound like these songs I'm talking about dust devil second television and the really sort of messy performances that are on some of these tracks while I can make this album feel pretty liberating pretty exciting they do make some of these songs feel kind of dull like if they were performed with more tightness they would just be so much more cutting maybe they're not doing this stuff with the best execution they possibly could I feel like some songs could have used more effects but I did end up liking this maybe a little bit more than I should have but I did Mission of Burma just has a lot of musical characteristics that I like I am feeling a light too decent six on this LP what did you guys think of it if you listened to it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Mission of Burma forever 
jO5gV6w8epQ,know what I'm gonna listen to some hip-hop I don't think so buddy hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review a Saab Rock skeleton a stop rock was once in the late 1990s and early 2000s a very prominent figure in underground hip hop back when underground hip hop was not really as big as it is now thanks to the internet I would actually go as far as to say he is like the ultimate nerd MC and I don't mean like the the fashionable cool kind of nerd image that were faced with all too often today look at me I'm quirky I wear thick glasses and I'm into really obscure stuff I'm living a lie instead I definitely give a stop the nerd of the Year award for his is very dense and well read lyrics regularly employing words that will have you getting up to grab the nearest dictionary to decipher what the hell he's saying and even though it can be really difficult to read into this guy's lyrics for me it's truly the only way you can fully appreciate and enjoy his music because he's not the kind of emcee who's going to sit back and make a poppy track where you can kind of just tune him out and just vibe to the instrumental in my opinion a saps early stuff is great of course it's very wordy at times very passionate and and catchy the instrumentals on his earlier LP is to have a more I guess traditional sound to them but a stops I guess progression past his earlier work has been a bit of a double-edged sword for me while I do feel like his songs have become more conceptual his verbiage has come just heavier on the album none shall pass he started kind of taking on this this sharp like somewhat forced grasp to his vocal delivery and not really varying that all too much and I feel like that kind of kills his vocal dynamic a bit and makes things ever so slightly redundant and admittedly it took me a little while to kind of get past it too and it took me a while to review this album as well and it's mostly because it's it's been a long time since I've kind of sat down and intently listened to an album from this guy with-with-with now what continues to amaze me about this guy is just his aw inspiringly detailed approach to rapping about things that I feel like past most people buy on an everyday basis for example the track fryer starter which is kind of about a late-night trip to a California donut shop and it kind of touches down on everything from sprinkles to the various styles and flavors to double chins and the instrumental and and an Aesop's voice itself have a very kind of creepy eerie and strange the aura around them and it just makes me think man do you contemplate everything so deeply he definitely can turn something normal into something eerie but on another track he turned something that is kind of childish and silly into an intense battle for dietary sovereignty the track is Grace and it's really a SAP kind of wrapping from the perspective of himself as a child not wanting to eat the greens on his plate for dinner and lyrically he just builds the climax higher and higher and higher as the track progresses the stories on here can get I guess legitimately dark though the track Ruby 81 is really one of my favorites on skeleton and it features him kind of rapping over this throbbing drone that sounds like it could have come from a horror movie soundtrack or something and the story itself is is kind of about this kid who slips away from from her mother's attention during a 4th of July fireworks show and nearly drowns in a pool but it does kind of have a happy and animal-related ending but I will say this album is more about endings than it is happiness because if there is one huge theme that links most of these tracks together it is death the Trank zero dark thirty kind of seems to be about a stop putting weaker rappers out of their misery and he talks about doing this with with just such were Deaver tsa's you wouldn't think that's what the song is actually about it's very subtle braggadocio sness i guess and on the track crows which has Kimya Dawson singing on the hook and she is a really nice creepy addition to the song her and a stop kind of spit all over the tradition of celebrating the dead with with tombstones and rock monuments when really all you're doing in the ground under that monument is just rotting the track homemade mummy on here brings more of it to another level and literally talks about the instructions for mummification but kind of uses a cat as its guinea pig so to speak a few of the tracks leading up to the finish of this album have some pretty grimy beats and some stray spitting from a stop I love those tracks a lot and this album is bookended by these two songs that that kind of paint this current self-portrait of ASAP as this guy who is a loner maybe slightly suicidal and even though his isolation is self-imposed it's also kind of driving him insane it's a dark picture but one of the most sincere and and raw moments on this album poetically I feel a stop is as good as he's ever been that's to be expected but this album does present a first for him though it is the first time he is handling all the production on one of his LPS for sure this is a cohesive album but I do feel like some of the hooks are lacking on this thing for example the third track on here the hook is so understated it might as well not even be there and the track racing stripes just seems to be I guess so odd and silly not only rapping about kind of haircuts and some funny stories behind them but the track just really kind of feels too indulgent for me and the instrumental adds to that but when it comes to the beats on here while it is not my favorite production of the year it is pretty solid and does the job I really love the classic rock drum fills and the heavy guitar chords on the track zze top the pulsating stints on the track zero dark thirty have a nice tension to them the beat four fryer starter is very eerie and creepy and kind of becomes hilarious given the subject matter I talked about before there are some spots where I kind of catch deja vu tracks that have a drum sample that is dirtied up just a smidge with a kind of muddy bassline songs like thousand o'clock or Tetra there are several songs or instrumentals on this LP like that so I do kind of catch a bit of deja vu from time to time with the beats I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing what did you guys think of it if you've listened to it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana ASAP rock forever [Music] [Music] 
q6T1zppObmA,I'm totally had ideas for these stupid intro everyone anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd time for a review Holograms self-titled this is a debut full-length LP of Swedish quartet Holograms and and this is now now on captured tracks records kind of a surprising release for the label surprising for me because the bands on capture tracks kind of have a reputation for having very low fire recording styles and production that has just slathered in reverb and I guess once I kind of put it that way it's not that weird these guys do have some reverb on their recording and and their presentation is kind of rough around the edges but I guess the left hook comes in with this bands very kind of classic post-punk style they most definitely have an attitude that is not too much unlike that of Gang of Four and they've also got a very driving and I want to say dark momentum a lot like Joy Division there's a little bit of garage punk peppered throughout a couple songs on this LP and there are moments where Holograms feels as frantic and kind of manic as like an early Buzzcocks song now even though this band is clearly influenced by the old they don't sound dated not by a long shot to me they actually sound like a handful of new or her punk bands that have a very kind of Ruffin and grainy quality to their recordings like the band Ice Age and I would compare them to the Australian band royal headache too though their thighs are both low I would say Holograms emotions or feelings are even lower meaning there is a lot of unhappiness and malcontent between the 12 songs on this LP I mean to me the songs on here kind of sound like it could our release for this very difficult to fight off depression but these guys like try their asses off to fight off this depression with very crunchy head bashing guitars very hard-hitting tight drums and the occasional keyboard to now pretty much every single song on this LP takes a very simple approach an almost wire pink flag level of simplicity the track chasing my mind comes to mind with this very very basic synth melody that plays over and over throughout the song and a chord progression that by now you have probably heard in about a hundred thousand songs there are not a lot of details hidden between the choruses and the verses on this thing and they are not really between the layers of instrumentation either and the very kind of rough production kind of muffles what salties there are but salty even when Holograms is playing like a slower or a sadder song it's not really their game instead these guys are trying to perform these tracks with just straight guts and spunk with some very memorable hooks that are emphasized by these vocals and that depression I was talking about earlier it leads to a lot of very tortured songs the opening track on here monolith is is a little unsettling describing a scene with with people standing in line in concrete floors the factory setting that I've heard or read these guys work in as the day job and other tracks on here like stress and memories of sweat and especially ABC city repeat a lot of the same grievances kind of bringing this theme of the album home especially ABC City talking about isolation and desolation in the lyrics it's really a theme that ties this entire album together and these guys deal with the tension in in different ways other songs on here come off more frenetic like the track transform which has these wailing guitars just screaming in the background with these syncopated bass and drum hits really laying on this wild groove but there's kind of a sliver of bright attitude on the track astray which has like these octave pumping synthesizers and and these handclaps toward the end of the song and the track fever it's pretty and feminine alot extent flying toward the finished that track too if I had any gripes about it it's that execution-wise I do feel like this album could have a little bit more to it five-minute tracks like Sweden's pride I feel I could have been delivered with a bit more intensity to really kind of make this song not only feel climactic but worth the five minutes it lasts most of the songs on here fit in a two three minute range and it's really kind of a I guess a perfect song length for these guys I think it's fantastic how these guys really do a lot with with just a little stylistically I do wish this band was a little more unique a touch more unique but I feel like these guys do make up for the lack of innovation with some really catchy and just in just great songs basic but strong and infectious I love the moody dark attitude of this thing I love this style I love how the twelve songs on this thing lyrically kind of attack the root of that sadness that that is really kind of getting to these guys I feel like Holograms has a lot of going for them I'm kind of feeling a light too decent eight on this thing if you guys have listened to it what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next Anthony Fanta no Holograms forever 
42RML92tDyQ,come on man you can do this hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review nas life is good nas is a New York rapper and few rappers have had the impact on hip hop that he has and what's kind of funny is that is impact on the genre can really kind of be boiled down almost to one album Illmatic fantastic LP for most of you I don't think I need to tell you why and if you don't know why just go listen to it now in terms of what happened after Illmatic nas was still seeing commercial success definitely selling tons of Records he had chart-topping singles as well but he did kind of change his style up embracing themes of excess and drugs and and violence in his lyrics which did kind of turnoff some fans and critics which in a way is lightly hypocritical because throughout this time period when nas was changing himself more toward this style there were plenty of gangster rap and mafioso rap albums that were pretty popular but a part of the reason why a lot of people disliked this change in nas and I have to say personally I agree for the most part is it was kind of perceived as being a bit reactionary nas shifting nas doing something different in order to kind of stay relevant in the rap limelight now throughout the 10 albums that nas has released he's had his moments where he's fallen off and he's come back but for me after illmatic any failures or improvements that nas ended up making and he comebacks whatever relative because to me overtime nas's instrumentals and his hooks and his song topics just continue to get worse you know and it wasn't even that Naz had changed or embraced the mainstream or anything like that it's that he was never really even that good at it he never really had the ear for beats and for hooks that jay-z did as nas and jay-z were kind of evolving into the late 90s and the 2000s time and time again nas would water down his lyrical content he would simplify a track really kind of make it catchy make it hooky and it never really was at least not in a long-term kind of way because when I listened back to older singles that I remember being pretty popular at the time like got yourself ax or hate me now they sound really kind of faded and dated today now on the albums that dropped after nas is first two full-length LPS he would have his his personal or his conscious moments for sure but they were never really as groundbreaking or as I guess fiery or as passionate as his early stuff now does this new album kind of show nas turning a new leaf I mean I would hope so it's kind of coming off the coattails of two albums that were not really that stellar to begin with and I mean think about it nas really could experiment and do anything that that he wants at this point I mean he's been making albums for almost 20 years and through all the highs and lows he's still been relatively popular people have pretty much always been interested in what he's putting out next why not do something different why not change everything up his place in hip-hop is pretty solidified but no that don't happen pretty much what you get on this LP is a slightly more modernized version of the same old same old from nas weak beat choices bad hook seong concepts that don't really fully connect and a bunch of features that feel more political than they do logical or musical like Rick Ross and Swizz Beatz and Amy Winehouse they're pretty much two kinds of tracks on this album there are potholes and there are weaklings the straight-up rapping on the track locomotive sounds pretty good but I'm not totally in love with the the beat on this song the beat on the track that Don I actually think is the best instrumental on this entire album but I'm not really in love with every single lyric nas drops on that track the track Queen story would be a pretty decent song because it's it's got a nice storyline to it but it just has this instrumental that sounds like it's coming straight out of Disney's Fantasia the track accident murderers is another interesting song concept but it doesn't really come together all that well there's kind of a nice background to it talking about urban violence and its casualties and kind of second-guessing the people who are the murderers to have done it intentionally to really be kind of man enough to do that kind of thing but it's not exactly like Rick Ross stays on topic he's rapping a little faster than he usually does but it's pretty much oh car oh bitch and then he turns the last line of his verse into a plug for his new album the track daughters on here is another interesting song concept but I don't really feel like nas brings it home or anything like you do get this sense of yeah it's difficult being a father raising a daughter in today's day and age and he's talking about you know scantily clad pictures on Twitter posting things that you really shouldn't be posting on Instagram but it all just kind of comes off as as being a little bit like comedic aggravation that you would see in a sitcom I don't really get the sense of oh man this is a call to arms this is a serious problem and the tracks summer on what a meaningless trashy just forgettable pop rap tune that nobody is gonna care about in three years who's gonna care about this songs who his beats is probably gonna take the instrumental from it and just use it somewhere else if it's lucky it'll get on a little Wayne mixtape next year and there are a couple really just corny tasteless throw backs on here like the song reach out with mary j blige or the song you wouldn't understand it's just oh sickeningly bad nostalgia he can't get over just how like buttery smooth those tracks out sour sour I kind of feel that way about the last track on here to buy baby which I feel like is even less of a song because compared to all the other tracks on here the audio quality is almost kind of like an unfinished demo I feel like the only thing that's eligible about this album aside from a couple instrumentals is that you do kind of get some personal details from nas or some personal feelings from him in regards to just his family life his recent divorce I do kind of feel for him and really kind of relate to him when those moments come up because I do get shots of kind of passionate details and emotion but when I hear tracks like cherry wine with Amy Winehouse that kind of scene I was just longing for love from this kind of ideal partner it's just coming off kind of lazy and unimaginative what do you want what you want me to say at this point I'm not gonna sit here and pretend to like this you know I love listening to music and I love talking to you guys about music I do but I'm not gonna not gonna lie about whether or not I like something I'm really kind of feeling a strong three to a light four on this LP I'm sure why do you guys have heard it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana nas forever [Music] 
Q94LHgvb7vs,I was so young hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review rec and reference no youth these guys are an experimental rock project they are pretty anonymous from what I understand and this is their sophomore LP e and this LP doesn't really fall into one set style or genre instead these guys kind of jump all over the place and blend a series of things together meanwhile making their own sort of unique direction maybe even some indie rock is mixed in there as well but the greatest fee of this entire LP is that it creates such a noisy abrasive really kind of disturbing atmosphere with no guitars whatsoever and I was pretty stunned because on first listen with this LP I could have sworn that I had heard some guitars but after revisiting with it yeah it's it's pretty clear this this album is comprised of nothing but since and samples as well as drums and vocals and even though synthesizers are no stranger to any of the genres that these guys experiment with to use them exclusively has led some really unique hellish and twisted sounds so if you do like your music to be the sonic representation of dancing and singing teddy bear that that loves to cuddle on cold winter nights you may want to listen to another album because this is a legitimately creepy thing I would go as far as to stay freaky and as I was relisting and re listening to it I did feel kind of feelings of paranoia creeping in parts of this album really do kind of sound like the soundtrack to a murder or at least an abduction now the sounds on this LP are stellar it's basically where rec and reference kind of finds a way to beat competition the LP opens up with this really sharp echoey metallic rattle it sounds like a transformer on top top of a telephone pole as exploded but this LP is not just random noise after random noise these guys do figure out a way to take the noises they create and incorporate them effectively into their songs like on the tracks the lists steel which has all these atmospheric and just harsh rough textures swirling around this track at hurricane speed that these guys have written and it just brings so much intensity to the song so overall the production on this thing is great really fantastic sounds just really unique textures I think my only real gripe with it is that the drums could have been better recorded but they are well performed from the blast beads to the really slow and dramatic beats to the fills and the rolls another weak link in the chain though I would say is the vocals however there are some spots on here where you do get wretched vocals like in black metal screen vocals that have a bit of a hardcore or a punk or a post so it was hardcore vibe to them those sound great some of the spoken-word vocals sound great but they can be kind of hit or miss as well as the singing vocals and I guess my issue would be is that they fall a little flat and that they don't really match the creepiness or the intensity of the music that they're singing over and get kind of lost in the haze I end up tuning them out and they don't really bring a lot of personality to the track I guess and maybe even to a slight degree kill the the very disturbing vibe I guess another gripe I have with this LP is the songwriting the song structuring most of the songs on here range from about three to four minutes but they feel so much shorter to me sometimes because I guess they do take a while to kind of pick up momentum and once they grab it it's not all too long before the ending is right there and there are just some songs out here that I just wish were longer for music this strange in this noisy McKey and reference definitely likes to kind of keep things brief I guess because a lot of these tracks do come off is just kind of being like motifs but to kind of continue on the songwriting there are some really great chord progressions if not drones on this album like the track cannot and obedience I am really impressed with the musicality of some of these songs too overall I was pretty impressed with this LP I think it's a great album for an up-and-coming group there are those elements in the songwriting and in the vocal delivery that do feel a little weak to me but I think it's fantastic that these guys can blend so many genres together have a track that feels more black metal have a track that feels more drone have a track that feels more Punk influenced and yet it all blends together so well I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this LP I like that these guys are coming out with a bold interesting and certainly unique unquestionably unique style but they're just things that I feel they could have done in building this album that would have just made it so much more above and beyond for me what did you guys think of this if you've listened to it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana record reference forever 
IAjx34zlijc,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and doing a little list I've been wanting to do something like this a while a short 10 song list of my all-time favorite Velvet Underground songs The Velvet Underground they have a number of documentaries about them some of them are actually on YouTube and you can watch yourself those can condense the band's history and just their place contextually in music better than I can in a short video for sure but but the Velvet Underground are an important band to me I was not all too impressed with their music I remember when I had first heard them but after returning and just sort of really I guess getting a grip of what they were trying to do with their music they just give things like rough-around-the-edges recordings very abstract and sometimes very lewd and an offensive lyrics and a very simple simple instrumentation that is sometimes performed with a very kind of amateur display of musicianship all these things to me which originally were not all too impressive all of a sudden kind of became impressive and in a way became kind of beautiful I feel like it takes a special band a special group of people who have a really great vision to take things that people usually classify as being bad ugly sort of mmm subpar and really make them great really turn them into something special and kind of unique I feel like The Velvet Underground and they're very short discography did that very well across several records and the songs that I have picked in this 10 song mix are definitely showed that a few of them that I want to bring up Venus inverse beautiful song not not beautiful in the traditional sense but you know great track kinky sex lyrics John Cale's viola violent and whatever on that track is just wailing screaming and from what I hear you like put different strings on it to get that kind of unique sound to come out of it it is a twisted song furthermore Sunday morning in my opinion one of the most beautiful songs to ever be written period that's it can't say any more about it than that sister Rhea damn man this 17 minute track I believe which came off the band's second full-length LP is just this long twisted disgusting rock-and-roll Jam detailing this story having to do with cops busting in on this place where there's there's drugs going on there's there's like an orgy I believe I believe there's like transsexuals involved as well it's a pretty sick track in this 17 minute track went on much longer than that whenever the band would play in a live setting basically the handful of the records that this been put out when when they were around are very important to me really fantastic music music that I'm sure I wouldn't see music the way I do if I had not heard them and basically looking to kind of share them with you guys like I said this list is below this video I listed out via text you can search any of these songs on the internet and probably hear them but the entire list of tracks is also available to stream on Spotify as well so follow those links where you that list easily put it together pretty fast my favorite Velvet Underground tracks of all time and and that's it thanks for watching love you Anthony Fantana development underground forever [Music] [Music] 
u1uuvuAe8Xg,what a good pup that's what's up what a good pup that's what's up what a good pup that's what's up what a good pup that's what Sol Sol Sol - hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review baroness yellow and green these guys are a gouge amman this is their third full-length record and if you're a huge fan of sludge metal and stoner rock you're probably already familiar with their work and the beautifully orgasmic cover art that their front man john Baisley has created for not only the band's records but numerous other records for other groups as well that are just gorgeous now this is kind of a metal review but if you're not into metal you may want to stick around because you may be into what these guys are doing because on this new LP the band kind of finds themselves in the midst of an interesting progression interesting but not completely unique because Baroness on this LP is going soft her kind of walking down the same path heavy music heavyweights such as Mastodon and torch have walked down with their new LPS both of which are the most accessible in their respective discographies now despite pulling together a series of tracks that are easily some of the sweetest this band has ever produced Baroness has still not let go of their sense of ambition their knack for epic presentations because this thing is a double album seventy-six minutes 18 tracks across these 18 tracks there's quite a bit of love variety there are some loud pounding riffs quiet acoustic interludes softer rock tracks and pretty climactic builds there are a lot of changes in mood on this LP and there are some progressive elements as well but I'm not about to tag this as a progressive rock album there are tracks on here like take my bones away that are in one way or another constantly in a state of shifting of changing doing something different and there are songs on here that have really epic changes like the track little things at three minutes and 30 seconds listen for that this album does have its layers it has its subtleties but it's pretty straightforward LP very straightforward considering its 76 minutes but even though this LP is kind of easy to get into and for sure it's going to alienate some fans who are just unhappy with this thing because it's not scratching the same itches that blue album did that red album did I still think this LP is doing something kind of special rock that is this catchy this straightforward you know forgive me for saying this but I guess so simple rarely does rock like that get such a grandiose presentation even though this LP does have a change on it Baroness still maintains a lot of their great qualities I think more than a lot of their hardcore fans will we'll give them credit for there are still heavy moments on this LP take my bones away fantastic heavy riffs on that song these guys are definitely working with with their cleanest production sound yet basally is not screaming like he used to on the band's previous material but his clean vocals are pretty nice they're very low they're very resonant he has a real sense of passion to his singing and I feel like sticking to his cleans has kind of forced him to experiment a little bit more with his singing though there are tracks on here where I wish he was a little more adventurous with his vocal melodies there are spots on here that kind of hit me as being very kind of James Hetfield ish with his clean vocals and there are a lot of tracks on here that feature very very close vocal harmonies that kind of ring true as being sort of like Alice in Chains sometimes the vocals do really bring a commercial radio rock element to the cell but you know I I can't say it was done in an untestable way or anything like that now the band of course brings some really great harmonized guitar leads on these songs like you can pretty much expect from them than them so on this thing I'm really challenging fans why don't you like this record if you kind of find yourself not really caring for it what is this missing for you because to me this feels like a great band progressing the heavy sounds on here sound great to me take my bones away one of the first tracks on here it's a great groove it's not the heaviest track I've ever heard them put together but it makes up for by being extremely extremely catchy and the track march to the sea replaces distorted guitars with string sections which are just really pulsating quickly to keep the pace to keep the tempo of this track up up up up and it works really well these string sections sound great against the primal drums I wish there were more moments on this album like this and when the chorus comes in and those guitars finally just kick in it sounds really explosive because the guitars were just not there beforehand the track twinkler is one of the first soft moments on this LP and it is beautiful it is moving there and s really pens a quiet chilly folk tune on that album some nice guitar arpeggios very close vocal harmonies that feel very solemn it's a soft track but it's written really well same goes for the track you look the only tracks hadn't care for on the first disc were like cocaine IAM which i didn't feel like brought a lot of variation to the song structure I did like that they were using a synth on that track and overall using more sense on this album the track where I belong the intro to that track was ok I feel like once they started adding more instrumentation instead of just those guitar chords toward the beginning of the track it really started to get fleshed out sound fantastic and the vocal effects on C lungs just ruin the song for me almost entirely they feel really kind of obnoxious I guess the band was kind of going for something watery sound on that track but it really just takes me out of the mood of the song the second disk on here is easily the softer of the two discs I think for some people it's going to be the weaker of the two discs despite it really kicking off with a epic intro I love the green theme but a lot of the software tracks on here don't hit me with the same kind of emotional impact as the softer tracks on the previous disc for one reason or another for one track mountains beautifully written track beautifully compose track and performed but baronet's really kicks the song in the balls by taking the vocals like distorting them over compressing them to I don't know get some kind of texture out of them they just sound really noisy and unwelcoming while all the other instrumentation sounds really clear nice especially the acoustic guitars it just kind of kills the dynamic of the vocals and doesn't sound all that good I think the only softer sweeter track on this disc that I liked was the track had a very forlorn melody and vocal delivery to that I thought was awesome a really nice touch for the entire LP really a standout song thankfully the second disc finishes strong with the track the line between which has a righteous hook totally a song I could kind of see the credits rolling to this album for and and there's a nice sort of instrumental closer guitar closer to that that brings this thing overall I like this LP it is a long album a long ambitious album of catchy rock songs some more metal than others this is Baroness's softest release but only to a slight degree Baroness stylistically and just sonically covers a lot more ground on this LP with those strange sections with the sense with the cleaner vocals and they cover all this ground with a lot of tracks but the thing is among all these tracks Baroness does not really cut all that much fat because I would say at least a third of the songs on here in my opinion kind of pale in comparison to the others admiring the band's new direction not completely in love with the execution on every track though kind of feeling a decent too strong seven on the cell PPP have you guys listened to it if so what did you think did you what egg did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana baroness forever [Music] you

RG8FKXlGdBU,also love this record bombs away on business business hi everyone Anthony fam tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a very highly anticipated review Frank ocean's channel orange this guy's an R&B singer and a member of the California rap collective Odd Future then I would say with releasing very little material he has pretty much proven himself to be the most talented and worthwhile member of the group he's definitely the one with the most crossover appeal too and that shows in the projects he's been involved in ever since he made a splash with his debut mixtape nostalgia ultra ever since that thing dropped last year he has been on Kanye and jay-z's Watch the Throne and also under his belt some ghost writing too because he's written songs for Justin Bieber John Legend Beyonce and his voice in a songwriting style has definitely put him at the forefront of this recent strain of experimental and adventurous R&B artists which I mean let's face it pretty much the two biggest artists in that arena are Frank Ocean and The Weeknd both of whom I feel like have very modernized takes on classic R&B and soul artists the weekend for sure to me is a very dark and tortured and drug-addled version of Michael Jackson where Frank Ocean by contrast is much more of a Stevie Wonder Martin Gaye kind of guy now when it comes to nostalgia ultra a lot of people have asked me to review it for sure it's an alternative to the commercial art bita ruled the airwaves when I was a kid but it didn't really hit me as being unique or different enough to be all that exciting despite the fact that I wasn't all that hot on the weekend at the time - I found him much more interesting to follow for me this tape felt immature at some points it felt like the production could have been better than others and it comes to modern R&B I feel like Frank has one of the weaker voices out there right now dudes like Usher the weekend as well and and even our Kelly could totally out sing him I feel they have more range they sing with more conviction more passion now in now in short I feel like channel Orange is pretty much growth for Frank Ocean its progression and in a lot of ways it's really nostalgia ultra kind of on a grander scale the short interludes that guide the album from one section to another section are here the buttery smooth singing is here the production is pretty very there are a lot of styles covered in the instrumentals on this thing I thought there were some pretty unique song topics on this thing two tracks like sweet life and super rich kids to me kind of sing the rich kid blues these kids are coked up the parents aren't watching them the help doesn't even really care I don't really get why or if I should even sympathize with who or what Frank Ocean is singing about in tracks like this though I do kind of feel like the tracks super rich kids especially with that verse from Earl Sweatshirt is a much more satirical portrayal of people like this and that shower headline is hilarious but the track sweet life sort of seems to be singing about this person that Frank Ocean is kind of having a crush on in love with maybe and they live a very privileged lifestyle but Frank doesn't really get into the nitty-gritty of the relationship or anything like that the song mostly is is pretty much about the things this person has the song crack rock however is a tale of just somebody's life being ripped apart by drug addiction I wish the instrumental were a little slower really kind of carried the the weight of the situation but when you really look at the chord progression and and the hook on the song with the very dark low-pitched background vocals there is some very subtle moodiness to the song that I like there's a track on here where Frank kind of talks about his relationship with religion his difficulties when it comes to using it as a tool to solve personal problems of course I'm talking about Bad Religion the string sections on that song are to die for and even though I wish the second half of the song change it up a little bit more than the first it easily is Frank's most passionate performance on the album I actually wish he sang with that kind of fire on some other tracks here because songs like monks and Sierra Leone though Frank is singing and he's hitting the notes he's got the pitch there's not really a lot of fire there when I look at the lyrics of those tracks I kind of see a lot of abstractions a lot of disjointed thoughts and I'm not really seeing a lot of purpose to the song and it's almost as if Frank's lack of emotion on those tracks kind of confirms that in a way the track pink matter though toward the end of this LP is slow it's sweet Frank's performance is great it's really spacious like the song Bad Religion but brings a totally different mood it is a baby maker of a track and andré 3000's verse on the song amazing is there an emcee out there right now who is better equipped to rap about love than andre 3000 no and Forrest Gump is one of the last songs on here it's a love song and kind of could be either literal a song for the character of Forrest Gump or kind of attributing all of his characteristics to someone else Frank is in love with I love the fact that the song is so simple with the beats and and and the guitar leads there's just so little I guess musical phrases musical ideas going on however it's so impactful it just works plus it's the only bold and obvious reference on here I feel to a kind of man-on-man romance all the other songs are either dealing with women or have love interests that do not have a gender assigned despite the fact that Frank has admitted to being in love with Smith's with someone of the same gender and this has brought a lot of hype to this album it's not really played a large role in the subject matter the fight the final song I want to talk on here a bit is one that I'm sure a lot of people are focused on with this LP the 10-minute epic pyramids song kind of progresses into this story about prostitution Las Vegas pyramid Hotel it's kind of weird and takes a very dark and weak and like turn toward the finish line but my number one issue with the track is that I don't feel like it completely justifies its 10-minute length nowhere is this song more interesting than at the introduction and the very first chorus doesn't have any new climaxes it all just kind of goes downhill but to a very slight degree I'm going to keep riding the complain train on this thing I feel like overall this album is pretty disjointed very disjointed in comparison with nostalgia ultra and I feel like that is the only respect in which this album kind of falls short though tracks like pyramids can be very good and progressive Frank doesn't really have a way of blending them effectively into the album on Channel Orange now despite all the pitfalls that I feel like this album has I have to say by modern standards it's totally an imaginative R&B album the production is there for the most part the songs are there and to a lesser extent the execution is their popularity wise Frank is kind of really at the top right now when it comes to this style is he my favorite artist in the style no but I do like him a lot a lot more than when I was just hearing nostalgia ultra I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this LP what did you guys think of it did you like it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Frank Ocean forever 
J17fzL6a-lw,who love this record anything baby hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd back again with an album review twin shadow confess this is the solo project of frontman and singer-songwriter George Lewis junior multi-instrumentalist to his debut LP forget I reviewed the year came out pretty positively an album that on first listen really underwhelmed me a bit but then I gave it a second chance once I realized that that Chris Taylor of grizzly-bear had produced it and released it on his own label because the selfie is kind of understated a very understated approach to new wave pop but there are all these really subtle elements to it that I think are really nice Chris Taylor brings some very great color very subtle colors to a lot of these tracks a lot of the bass lines are great very danceable the drums are really grooving but in my original review I acknowledged how quiet this record felt the production style that I liked was kind of holding this project back from bigger things and I said that if George ever put out a record with higher quality production and and stuck roughly to his same style he would be a pretty big threat in indie music the better production I wanted is here Plus this LP right out of the gate is getting a release on 4ad records on paper some great things are occurring but in fact I wanted from this album is not here at least on a personal level anyway I'm really not digging confess I'm gonna be blunt it's gonna be straight with it the NuWave influence that was on twin shadows last LP it is here and it's stronger than ever the songs and the sounds on this thing referenced the path but our unmistakeably knew which is a bit more refreshing than reverb soaked and tuneless nostalgia but by kind of coming through with a clearer sound this time around I feel like inadvertently George has exposed a few weak links in twin shadows chain for one the vocals on this new record I feel like now that I'm really kind of hearing George front-and-center he doesn't feel like a very captivating frontman their tracks on here where he belts and and hit some of those highs really well comes off pretty emotive the song 5 seconds is an example but other tracks on here he just feels like he's weaving in an app tune he's kind of whimpering and really awkward very awkward for for me the listener to kind of sit through it you can call me on as an example and and the intro to the the track when the movie is over I was really sitting there thinking is he trying to sing is this singing he's singing here the vocals on this thing can really be a hit or a huge huge miss which is kind of sad because I've seen twin shadow live at least twice and I don't really recall them being that huge of an issue now the lyrics on this thing too are another issue for me they're nowhere near as abstract as they were on forget and because of that there's just less mysticism what I'm talking about our lyrics that are really vague melodramatic and shallow references to love and hearts that couldn't really be anything but but just insincere cliche stuff that sounds like it's been copied and pasted really transplanted into these songs to kind of give them a a semblance of emotion actually being there but none of it is really tangible let me tell you the heart better be your favorite organ in the human body because you're gonna hear about it a lot it's just the kind of stuff that's very palatable and fun and perfect when you're listening to a very popular single from the era of music that this sound actually comes from in that case you're kind of hearing the cream of the crop you're only getting a small dose and I really have no reason to believe that this album does what the 80s did any better than how the 80s did it plus the cleaner production this time around has made some of the songs on here feel a little sanitized which does not spell out good results when it comes to some of the dancer tracks on here because they really don't have that momentum all the songs on here are since soaked there's a mixture of real drums and drum machines very rigid bass lines and some of the courses on here do explode beautifully I'll say but for the most part I feel like the songwriting the production the instrumentation it's just kind of man it just gets the job done it's sweet while it's on but there's no real memorable impact that goes on with this LP now I do see the appeal behind this album if you are into it not saying you shouldn't be but me personally just not really getting much out of this thing I'm kind of feeling a strong forward to a like five on this LP what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next did you have high hopes for this thing after enjoying twin shadows debut LP let me know Anthony Fantana twin shadow forever 
NImDLA14kHs,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an EP review fox agem take the kids off Broadway these guys are a singer-songwriter duo made of Sam France and Jonathan Rado but definitely not a typical singer-songwriter duo and this year is the first time a lot of people are hearing them thanks to kind of a leg up they've gotten recently this is a signing with the label jag jag you are this is not their first official release though there have been a few EPS and even a 7-inch that they've put out that have kind of built up to this point I know the material on this EP has been kicking around at least since last year now there are seven songs on this EP extremely fun collection of tracks I talked about a lot of the influences and just the the overall style that these guys kind of present on a track review I did for the song off of this EP make it known there's definitely a rich old school rock and roll vibe on this thing there's strong elements of garage rock psychedelic rock baroque pop blues music as well just bits of jazz and do up this thing simply put is a musical circus and it's sewn together and presented in a way that that feels really chaotic but it's really all too detailed to be completely thrown together so if you do end up listening to this thing you're definitely gonna catch sounds from the doors the Rolling Stones David Bowie the kinks and The Velvet Underground it's a lot to take in from the Moody Oregon Rock intro on the song teenage alien blues to the really huge climactic and string kissed ending on the track waiting for you there's just so many different bits to this then you get that refined colorful production and arranged instrumentation that you would expect from the kinks or Bowie the vocal delivery that that takes over on a majority of these tracks is distinctly Mick Jagger these guys definitely kind of playthings druggie and loose like The Velvet Underground and I would even go as far as to say there is like some Zappa esque satire one moment that strikes me like that specifically is the track teenage alien blues where you hear the lyric come out of Gaga got a head full of acid delivered and in such a ridiculous tone and I feel like some of the background vocals can carry a kind of ridiculous tone to I feel like these guys are satirizing the era of music that they pull from it but also kind of just giving a loving embrace to a lot like Ariel Pink's Haunted graffiti these guys definitely mine music from a different era and men really kind of bring it all together into this Frankenstein monster of sounds and and bands and in genres that were running parallel to one another but didn't necessarily criss cross there are a lot of artists mining out there these days but what kind of separates these guys to me from a lot of them is just how ambitious and insane some of their song structures are I can't even really begin to describe how some of these songs are built some have very climactic ending this others seem to end in completely different places than when they begin and along the way there are all sorts of detours segues and build ups that bring the the many parts together and whether these guys are kind of doing a four-minute bit and it bit in a bit or stringing a song out to ten minutes it stays engaging and another contemporary influence I'm sure is Richard Swift to the last song on here is actually dedicated to him is actually dedicated to him one of his albums is referenced in the lyrics we mixed a great deal of songs on the CP and a lot like Arial pink but with a completely different personality he minds from the past quite a bit too when it comes to making his music he definitely loves that vintage sound and I guess the final contemporary influence or just comparison that I would make with these guys is definitely I gotta say the unicorns God is saving unicorns especially with the second to last track on here why did I get married the vocal just said to me all them patter all the way and just the the topic of the song as well kind of felt like something that the unicorns would write a song about in their heyday now I did already say on this EP the production is kind of vintage and I mean it it is just distinctly old it sounds like it's from another era at some points but these guys load their songs with a lot of anachronism z' sounds and effects that you wouldn't normally hear in the era of music that they're trying to recapture to an extent throw a drum machine in there for a split second scream until your brain is fried just freak plus you've got all these sounds bleeding into each other all these noisy instrumental shifts on the album it is just hell on wheels the Golden Age of rock and roll is just crumbling on this EP however the song still kind of shined through for the most part I would say the one downside to this EP not just that there isn't enough material on here hmm but the other counts side would be that I feel like sometimes these sounds are hidden a little bit by the haze of noisy production the haze of effects the haze of just nostalgia I would say a little bit though I do think these songs function beyond nostalgia I'm feeling eight decent eight on the CP what did you guys think of it if you gave it a listen did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next Anthony Fantana oxygen Oh forever 
qnzAw1QuayE,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an EP review H sick or herb sicca with coca d this guy is a juke and and footwork music producer both styles of electronic music originated from Chicago and have been as of late seeing a relatively decent amount of underground success the genres are being combined and and recognized internationally among many different producers labels like planet mu and warp or picking up records that that either play in these Styles combine them or just experiment with them and this style for the most part is characterized by a lot of space between the bass kicks in these productions really kind of letting those hang in the back and allowing the treble elements of the rhythms to kind of drive things the hi-hats the snares and these high hats and snares are produced to be just really relentless having very jittery scary very kind of rattling quality to them and these snare and hi-hat patterns can be really dizzying and when a producer in these styles is great they're in a constant state of flux and that change that hi hats and these snares are always going through brings a real sense of progression to the songs of course all these elements are paired with some really fast tempos and at times some repetitive looping vocal samples which comes from the Juke side by side of the hybrid that a lot of producers are pulling together which of course borrows even further back from ghetto house but if you are familiar with electronic music styles like break beat and drum and bass jungle I don't feel like this is going to be that difficult into music in this style because just like those styles there are just patterns flying at you from every direction it's just a different kind of pattern a different kind of groove and I feel like herb sicca definitely has his own spin on this groove because even though there are some artists out there representing the style of music in the raw tracks man for example curve kind of brings a bunch of African elements into his music and kind of claims an interesting stake of musical property though artists like Africa high tech have come in this direction and experimented with it already herb sicca definitely focuses more on the juke and footwork side of things and just kind of keeps it there after a very kind of glossy and blissful intro the EP starts with a song gallery easily one of my favorite moments very fast synthesizers and interesting otherworldly groove jungle sound effects and shakers the sound of just sequence shakers playing as fast as you could set them to play the sounds on this thing are luscious they're dirty they're grainy they're dark just the beat is so hectic and i love the corporation on this thing didn't the track you don't need a pair of shoes has a pretty dark chord progression to and the tempo feels a little bit slower on that track leaving more space for just the the hi-hats and the snares to just go even wilder I love all the indescribable noises just swirling around that song the really nice sub bass tones rumbling throughout the song too and the fourth song on here manages to kind of cut the tempo down even more i would say half as to some great arpeggios and these metallic chimes to them now as far as some quick downsides the track on here co energy though it is colorfully produced like a lot of other songs on here it does kind of fizzle out for me and there are some tracks on here that just really don't warrant a strong physical reaction some songs on here just really seem to kind of get me moving and and kind of thinking at the same time just the myriad of sounds and intricate layers that I'm hearing all at once but others just do feel a bit underwhelming I guess it is a bit short it does kind of feel like there is still some room for development in terms of her sikka really defining his style with his African take on these genres of electronic music though the good news is that the song co energy is remixed by more sounds toward the end of this EP and it just sounds fantastic there's a nice diversity among the tracks here her sick it definitely proves himself to have some great production chops and is easily a producer who if you're looking for music in this style is a guy to watch even though this EP isn't one of my top favorites of this year it does have some of my favorite songs in this style feeling strong 7 on the CP what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next Anthony Fantana her sicken coca d I don't even know if i'm pronouncing those correctly hit some gay brother you 
ZMZxona5az4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd you remember that segment that I haven't done in a long time and it was partially because I didn't want to do it anymore and I didn't think I was I was ever gonna do it again I don't remember it either all right why you know review sort of going to look at a bunch of releases that I wanted to review maybe other people wanted me to review didn't get a chance to review other albums were more interesting to me didn't fit in my schedule whatever going to talk about a bunch of them right now I know that there are others that I haven't reviewed there you know still sort of kicking around in there just one man not going to review everything okay the new div album or dive used to be known as dive Brooklyn band debut LP and you know that this group features Cole Smith member of Beach fossils I believe he's playing live with them a lot of caught them itself by Southwest he was performing with them and if you're into a lot of these Brooklyn bands who are into this very light atmospheric shoot a Z sound um you're gonna like this group now me personally review after review after review this style has not gone over well with me simply because I feel like the songs are bland just just just no personality and it's all just a wash and reverb and that's it you know it's like there's not much detail or anything or substance there and the reverb kind of replaces that the atmosphere replaces that the atmosphere just kind of comes in and fixes that fixes that problem and you know after listening to this LP sitting down listening to it returning to it again returning to it again after multiple people just suggesting it to me hey listen to it hey it's good hey it's great I just don't really have any reason to believe that this album performs this style any better than than anybody else's right now including Beach fossils including Lotus Plaza I just don't believe that you don't got to agree with me Linkin Park living things yep having reviewed this one not planning on doing a formal review of this one sorry I you know do see Linkin Park's progression on this new LP after their last album which was definitely more electronic than I think fans were used to had Chester screaming less - definitely less of a rock and metal feel on that album now they're kind of going back to that sound a bit more on this album there are some very bright synthesizers on here that do hit me as being oh you know that's a bit like their last album but they are you know still sporting that metal influence a little bit more again but you know still even though I see that and it's cool that they're going back to their more rock-oriented roots I'm still at a Linkin Park fan you know Mike Shinoda I just never ever ever cared for his lyrics his skills as an emcee but you know I will give it to Linkin Park the whole rap metal thing has definitely become the mistreated stepchild of the metal sub-genre community I do think Linkin Park are up there with Rage Against the Machine in that day you know we're definitely way less gimmicky with it then other bands were and I would say you know are legitimately with with real sincerity and passion trying to bring these two genres together it's just a matter of it not being my style in the way that they do it that's all Lauren asked the dust this guy is a beat music producer new album on brain feeder records he has put out other material on the label too I believe and what I am hearing of him on this album it's easily his darkest and most abstract release yet easy hands down if you're looking for some really kind of gritty grainy really who darkened who beats instrumentals then listen to this check it out but for me personally while the sounds are amazing very colorful very well produced very interesting deep lush like I said dark and grainy sounds I don't really find the pacing the progression the grooves of these instrumentals to be really all that interesting Beach Boys why God made the radio oh man this was excruciating to listen to I am NOT even gonna joke I'm not even gonna beat around the bush it was excruciating someone please tell me that I'm wrong in the comments someone tell me that I am wrong in that I I thought I heard auto-tune on this album did I hear auto-tune on this album but man how far can you fall I mean I feel like the Beach Boys it's kind of sad in that you know they are falling into that stereotype that oh well when you get old you just stop making good a good mood and interesting and and just like pioneering records this album really kind of sounds like wearing a Hawaiian shirt and really short khaki shorts while drinking a coconut drink and washing your sports car in the driveway of your gated community into the unity Ghost mice all we got is each other this is a really very colorful eccentric folk punk album I can't really say much terrible about it other than that the songs weren't really clicking with me there were moments like I wish that guitar was more in tune man I wish that vocal was a little more on pitch something like that but I realized that I'm sort of being picky about those things in a genre where you really shouldn't even care and there are some points on this album where I really feel like they're trying to force emotions onto me so friggin hard instead of sort of letting me come to the conclusion or sort of search within myself what I want the emotions I feel to maybe be a lot of what you're going to want in a genre of this style is there so give it a lesson it's on Bandcamp stream there for free six brew bantha self-titled album this is also on Bandcamp really hard-hitting noisy and abrasive power violence album not exactly the most original in the bunch when you talk about this style of music but certainly a very disorienting and punch in the face listen so yeah check it out another punch in the face this cattle decapitation album monolith of inhumanity this kind of metal this very I guess you could say tightly produced album is is really just something that I am NOT a fan of generally I wouldn't even say I'm a fan of this you know those albums were that the drums essentially sound like they're being played by a robot and you kind of hear the double bass drums playing at this very fast speed and they're being played in such a tight tight succession like problem however I do feel like this album is the closest I've come to really kind of liking an album of this style cattle the capitation certainly on this new album is pretty gruesome I like a lot of their riffs I like their energy certainly not a pretty listen because it is so intense at times and and I guess the way I could kind of illustrate it is in that genre of metal that I do like that I see as being the complete opposite of this is something like doom metal something like stoner metal you know really heavy very fat riffs I think a do metal song is more like a big fat husky maybe muscular underneath the fat kind of guy whereas this is more like a very 2% body fat kind of you know very lean cut no room for imperfection kind of setup deal and I guess from that perspective I can see the appeal in this it's just that you know years and years and years and years and years of kind of personally listening to analyzing music and just kind of you know exploring it on my own terms I've never quite gained an appreciation a taste for something like this though I do feel like every time I try something in this style I get closer alright Michael key Wanaka hope I'm pronouncing that correctly home again this guy is kind of a tree if you're looking for a nice new singer-songwriter new LP for him I feel like there are some times like on the title track on here in other tracks where he just does that really kind of solo vocal guitar thing where he will pen a gorgeous gorgeous song that is absolutely stunning just timeless I think in just its simplicity its directness I think this guy has a real knack for for melody for chord progression and and forwards to I think this guy's a serious talent however there are other songs on here where I feel like he totally dips into this 60 soul sound or does something that kind of sounds like like a bad Richie Havens impersonation though I do understand he is influenced by those things I feel like he bogs this album down when he just kind of goes on this nostalgia trip and goes and tries all this old crap instead of just you know embracing what is more uniquely him Diamond drugs self-titled LP this is a band involving members of Deer Tick Black Lips Los Lobos and those first two I like quite a bit and you know kind of being excited about the the grouping of all these different artists from from different bands who who do appreciate a lot of the same genres and show it off in their music you do get a pretty cool mix of garage rock on here folk rock alternative country like bar band rock on here too however I do feel like some songs on here do come off kind of repetitive or underdeveloped but how these guys make up for that slightly is sort of their their random and fresh and new grouping together into this kind of you know makeshift band has really made a lightning in a bottle kind of situation there is a fresh new energy with these guys on this album and it does make a lot of these tracks fun to listen to even if song writing wise they are just kind of okay alright Regina Spektor what we saw from the cheap seats I honestly just thought this album was okay not really my favorite of hers I haven't really been a fan a huge fan of anything that she's done since Soviet kitsch I feel like that album and the two that came before it are either good or or really great I feel like after Soviet kitsch Regina fell off just a little bit in terms of not being as quirky not being as eclectic or just just strange chock-full of personality and there are some moments on her more recent LPS that feel very overproduced I feel like her style just isn't as exciting to me as it used to be Fear Factory the industrialist these guys have had a long career of melding the sounds of thrash metal and death metal with industrial though these guys do catch a lot of flak from from people who not only hate metal but metal heads too I mean I think some of their early records like obsolete very good heavy stuff and on the expanded version of that LP there is a great swans cover there's no question that going into making the music that they did Fear Factory had good intentions and great taste in just a unique direction this album is kind of filled with all those really kind of robotic ultra I guess you could say harmonious but but really kind of flat choruses that were all over the album digit mortal that you know that was my first Fear Factory album you know following them that I was really kind of turned off by oh I don't care for the oh you know ah oh we need out and though this is sounding heavy this is sounding there are moments on this that really kind of go down that path and it's just not doing it for me future of the Left B plot against common sense though this project newest album from them they've come out with with a handful though this project does feature Andy Falcon and I have loved his work in mcklusky such a great post-hardcore band and on this album with this band he does bring a lot of that very snarky tongue-in-cheek attitude I don't really find a lot of the guitar riffs a lot of the songwriting to just be all that wild or all that fun in comparison with earlier material will really compared with McCluskey I'm really more of a McCluskey guy just gonna put that out there that's it why luckily man triple F life man boy you know waka flocka flame I've given flock of some flack in the past with his debut LP a lot of people have who are heavy into just really great lyrics in their hip-hop music you know who could blame them waka by all intents and purposes is not a very good lyricist however that does not mean his screaming his violent content and lex luger 'he's very bold production style does not have a time in a place i mean put on a walk a song if you somehow manage to kind of you know dumb down your need for thought-provoking lyrics you could have a lot of fun though this trend of being a really high-energy emcee who essentially kind of shouts really simple dumbed down stuff to get a very fast reaction out of people is kind of a current trend it's not really anything altogether new I mean years ago I was I was a pretty big fan of a couple little Jon & the east side Boyz albums I mean little John's stuff was hyped and though dudes like waka flocka and Chief Keef are essentially working with a new production and beat style these days it's really kind of coming from energy wise the same place so anyway in regards to triple f life i feel like this is a no this isn't no for me I don't really feel like he's doing himself any favors on this LP by kind of watering his style down by lightening a lot of the production and not going as hard but I also kind of feel like he's killing his style by inviting all of these just very popular mcs onto these tracks like Drake for one who don't really do his aesthetic justice they don't really fit in I mean I would much rather just hear Flocka and a bunch of emcees who are just as crazy and wild as him kind of rip it up on every track that is just abrasive loud trap style production and just keep that energy up Odyssey people hear what they see look up this dude find him on Bandcamp listen one of his instrumental tapes he's a pretty damn good producer this is a new album of him featuring not only some great production but him emceeing too and though I do feel like he definitely kind of takes the highbrow route with a lot of his lyrics he's definitely not a dummy when it comes to wordplay writing versus writing bars I kind of feel like flow wise delivery wise he's not the most riveting guy to listen to in the world that's just how I simply have to put it I guess like I said this guy has some serious production chops I feel like he just needs to kind of work on his his delivery if he's if he's going to just kind of climb the ladder so to speak and finally Azealia Banks 1991 ep what can i really say I mean this is just really kind of one-dimensional I kind of feel like for the most part Azealia Banks is just really rapping just to rap I mean she's not really saying much of anything on a lot of these tracks though she is rapping fast you know I guess I guess you got to give her props for the technical ability and she's rapping over a lot of house beats which is not necessarily anything new but I kind of feel like her music rides the hype of her music videos more than it does the actual merits of its musicality or her rapping ability the CP is kind of a one-trick pony and you know but then again it is only a four track EP maybe when her full-length album drops we'll get you know more I guess nooks and crannies of her personality and we're not just going to hear a continuation of songs that that really are kind of

_7eIJDRGBb0,ooh baby baby it's really hot outside it's all inside huh hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review The Dirty Projectors swing low Magellan Dirty Projectors is the Brooklyn based experimental indie pop project fronted by singer/songwriter and guitar player David long stress if I'm correct this is their seventh full-length LP and this band is known for its really bold strange and then kind of interesting style and fans longtime fans of the band can expect to hear a lot of that on this album well maybe not a lot maybe more like like some such as David long strength very adventurous guitar melodies and his his beautifully embellished chord progressions there's just a lot of virtuosity in his guitar playing if you love hearing technical and and very beautiful very refined guitar playing definitely check out what he does you can also expect to hear some very tight female vocal harmonies from amber Kaufman and angel Dara Dorian launcher its vocals to have a very kind of unique quality to them they're they're very strange sometimes feeling very sour too you know I could really go on because there are so many things that make Dirty Projectors so different from your average band and really it kind of depends on what album you're listening to as well but if there was a change in the overall formula in Dirty Projectors sound on this new LP it's really that the band kind of embraced a real sense of simplicity on swing low magellan the song structures on this thing art is long or is winding amber and angels vocal harmonies aren't even really utilized as much on this LP as they were on Dirty Projectors previous couple they're not as intrusive really kind of hanging in the background most of the time unless you have a female vocal singing lead and then on top of that the intricate drumming that that has been pretty prominent on Dirty Projectors last LP has kind of been replaced by much more simple rhythms and if you're not hearing a drum you will hear an electric beat or even some kind of unsatisfying handclaps and the instrumentation itself is is not even really that lavish or adventurous as colorful as laird even when something like a string section does manage to pop into a track it's not really orchestrated with as much imagination as what's been put on previous projectors LPS I feel like the band with this album started on a very straightforward path and when they came out on the other side at the end of the path all they had to show for it was a more toned down version of their usual sound I don't think the band has gotten more accessible I mean yeah sure things are a little simpler but David long struts voice the melodies he writes the vocal harmonies between amber and Angel the strange grooves and time signatures and and long strips very surreal lyrics are still going to be kind of a speed bump for people who have not heard of this band before it's not like swing low Magellan has some kind of super catchy crossover pop appeal I do think there are some great tracks on here though the track impregnable question is an amazing piano ballad beautiful love song the title track on here has a very warm bare-bones kind of Velvet Underground quality to it and the song the gun has no trigger the first single off of this LP has this amazing climax to it on the chorus and I think that song out of all of these on here has the most interesting and and surreal lyrics actually for the most part I think the songs on this album are very good it's that the Dirty Projectors don't really color them or flesh them out or detail them the way a hardcore fan would expect the production isn't even that good to the guitars can be I guess a little muddy sometimes if they don't really feel like they have any crunch any push especially when they get loud that's when they get a little rough the electronic beats on this thing are very flat colorless lifeless and even the vocals and the vocal harmonies come off a little you know kind of muddy as well and the reverb that's on the vocals sometimes the instrumentation too is just very kind of bare bones basic and cheap I would bet that the production's budget on this thing is the smallest Dirty Projectors have worked with since the glaad fact and I don't feel like I would be so underwhelmed by this album if Dirty Projectors previous LPS hadn't been so grand and in scope and Colour and imagination don't be surprised if swing low magellan is not as rewarding with repeated listens as at least their previous four albums I'm feeling a light too decent 6 on this thing what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next you have any Fantana Dirty Projectors forever [Music] [Music] 
CHhdSJLmdu8,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your view rush Clockwork Angels these guys are an Ontario rock band responsible for some of the most celebrated albums that progressive rock has to offer definitely not my favorite progressive rock band because Pink Floyd soft machine King Crimson Frank Zappa and Jethro Tull all kind of come in first but rush is definitely I would say in front of them when it comes to being the most accessible in their respective style funny enough the band kind of started with this blend of blues rock and and hard rock the latter of the two never really left their their sound I guess as they progressed from from album to album to album even as they started getting more technical more conceptual with their music and Russia actually put out some of their best records when progressive rock was kind of considered to be in its downturn Pink Floyd was breaking up yes was going pop and eventually even rush started kind of playing toward the demands of the new wave but was still able to kind of maintain their personality their style and a really sizable following now from the mid to late 80s to the late 90s it's not exactly the most celebrated spy in Russia's career and it's not really because they started putting out the most awful records on the planet or anything like that I mean I would say more or less they kind of stuck to their blend of hard rock progressive rock and pretty catchy hooks I guess I would just say the interest outside of hardcore fans kind of waned once rush stopped offering surprises where's the band going to go next you pretty much know they're going to stick to their rush sound which is necessarily a bad thing because in the 2000s Russia is still putting out albums consistently like they always have they're just a picture of consistency after decades of being in the music business they're still relying on getting lee's upper register tenor vocals his heart bass riffs Neil Peart tight Phil's energetic drumming his fantasy lyrics Alex license bright distorted guitars his fiery solos rush does what they usually do as good as you would want them to do it in 2012 but you know is there any reason to believe that this LP is better than their recent releases better than their classic releases and in my opinion I'm going to be completely honest technically I would say no there are progressive elements of this album undeniably a prog rock album but do I feel like rush is kind of pushing themselves to play better than ever on this LP I don't think so there are actually some songs on here that I'm pretty surprised at how simple some of them are like on the anarchist which rides this really kind of familiar chord progression I feel like a turd turn up in in May songs or the song records which has this really kind of melodic smooth sweet hook that is pretty catchy but instrumentally you know performance wise kind of underwhelming but there are wounds where you get some flashy drum fills you'll get certainly great chaotic guitar solos or ones that are very kind of melodic and purposeful and of course Gettys bass playing is very on point you get a lot of moments where I'll throw a fast little bass riff and a lot of personality and is playing you really know Getty or if when you hear it overall while I do think this album is sounding a little bolder a little ballsier and more ambitious than most of their albums that they have put out since the year 2000 I don't really feel like Oh rush man better than ever because you know these guys are world famous they're multi-platinum they have made music pretty much change the face of progressive rock what do they have to prove at this point I would say nothing you know and their points on this album where it feels like Rush acknowledges that a little bit especially when it comes to the technical abilities of this album but just because I feel like on an individual level this album ISM really blowing me away I don't think Russia's playing badly or anything like that I actually think as a unit Rush shines pretty brightly on this album they actually pull out some really great jams on some of these tracks the opening track caravan has a great Jam over the bridge and the jam kind of segues very tightly from one phase to another Getty is pulling all these riffs out that are just so pure classic rush total totally the stuff that was a huge influence on Primus ezeli work the recording on this album can be you know a little sterile at times a little too plastic modernized but through that there is still this immense chemistry that I feel between these guys on this album even when a song is just okay there's just a nice energy some nice interaction here between the chords and the rhythms and the melodies that these guys play that just comes with the decades of experience they have performing with each other I guess another slight letdown on this album would have to be the structure some of these songs though I know that courses have always been a big slice of Russia's pie I do feel like some of these songs on here are a little plainly structured with some riffs or some chords that are built out of what the vers instrumentation is and that kind of makes the intro then you get your verses choruses and verses bridge or solo outro BAM and when you do get a bit of a detour on a song sometimes it just feels really silly and almost unnecessary like the really bluesy acoustic break on the title track which has Gettys vocals with these really terrible effects on them or the cheesy stock sound of laughing and going yeah on the song carnies it sounds like it was ripped off of a sound effects CD I guess the one last major letdown of this album I guess I could say are the introductions to some of these songs back in the day when Rush was at their pinnacle they could write some awesome introductions to songs whether they were beautiful and delicate with with just awesome guitar parts like on 2112 or just very quirky weird unique and hard-hitting like a number of intros on hemispheres or moving pictures rush just knew how to craft intros that built up excitement and tension and really just grabbed ahold of your ears and demanded attention on here though a lot of these tracks kind of will start off with some boring sound effects maybe a synthesizer or just a tone just slathered in way too much reverb or atmosphere to really be engaging or really have a sound or a texture all its own and then after that kind of hums or just hangs in the air for a moment or two the song just starts it feels like it's being delivered up fast food style now the one thing that does work and does impress on this album to me is the songwriting and the lyrics the concept of this album now the verses behind these tracks the musical verses in terms of the section I'm talking about can be a little hit or miss but the choruses are straight-up great on a lot of these tracks really anthemic melodic memorable follow knows that sometimes the truth is contrary and of course it helps that Gailey still has a lot of passion in his voice he doesn't really push those really fierce highs like he used to back in the day but he still sings with a lot of I guess sincerity as usual his voices kind of an acquired taste and I'm glad into his older age he has still been able to maintain a lot of personality and just command with it now the most ambitious thing about this album and the thing about the selfie that I think most Rush fans have been excited about and really have been have been praising this album over are lyrics and the concept this album from what I've read and from what I understand by listening to the music itself is supposed to be a story and a lot of the tracks either pink character portraits of people in this story or groups of people or situations that occur in this story and from what I understand there's supposed to be a possible novel in the works with this story kind of as the blueprint and the story itself is kind of an abstract fantasy I would say which is fine you know it's it's really cool to get all these very out-there lyrics but I wouldn't say it's a story in the sense of you listen to this album and you get oh this happened and then this other thing happened and oh here's the the next thing that happened and oh here's like the climax of course that's open to interpretation but I feel like more than anything from this album I get a lot of whiffs of a full full philosophy from Neil Peart lyrics whether it's a song called halo effect whose title pretty much explains the subject matter or a song talking about the truth not necessarily being what it seems or a number of tracks that talk about freewill having control over yourself other things trying to impose control upon you there's a lot to enjoy and a lot to kind of perceive and and and see as being profound in what Rush says in a lot of its songs with this LP I think overall it's a fan pleaser for the most part like I said earlier is rush sounding better than ever in this phase of their career I would say yes but am I going to be returning to this album in the same way that I returned to their classic LP honestly no and that's just how I'm feeling personally what did you guys think of this album did you love it did you hate it why how do you feel it ranks and the rest of Russia's discography and yeah what should I review next Belova personally I mean I like the LP but I don't really love it you know none of it really got me excited I feel like I was pleased by this album satisfied by this album on the level of a fan you know in the way that a fan would be wow you know Russia actually made some good songs on this album I didn't find any of the songs to be terrible on this album and I'm very happy that the band after all these years has been able to make an album that yeah good so I'm kind of feeling a light too decent six on this LP and that's about it ruch Clockwork Angels forever [Music] you [Music] 
mgDP2G2USzQ,[Music] it is too late to be listening to Jordan shot oh it's an air-conditioner hi everyone Anthony Fantino here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Space Ghost perp mysterious funk The Chronicles of Space Ghost perp this guy is a young Miami rapper and producer he got a hefty amount of buzz last year off of some production and some verses that he laid into ASAP Rocky's Live Love ASAP and he had his own release last year that got him quite a bit of attention to kind of a free album slash mixtape that I didn't really care for all that much but undeniably kind of had its its own style the sounds on this thing are really dark lo-fi gritty kind of Spacey kind of weird to the point where it actually you know makes me rethink his lyrics a little bit because they are kind of simple and it just makes me wonder is is he trying to be as lowbrow as possible with track titles like take that dick suck a dick for 2011 grind on me and get your head bust a lot of these older tracks are actually believed or not on this new album but the production has been touched up a little bit to kind of bring out Space Ghost perps darkside like I said I didn't really care for his stuff the first time around but the production serves as kind of a saving grace for the second time around because it does make some of these tracks sound pretty eerie revisiting the track get you head bust I have a completely different feel with the song the very atmosphere can just reverb soaked rhythms and the murky synths and and Space Ghost perps very whisper quiet flow that has a very light rasp on it it just feels like he's going to creep up behind me at any second with a baseball bat and kind of take me out the amount of space surrounding perps beats and and his his flow he gets a lot of comparisons to cloud rap artists like ASAP Rocky and little B and I would say that comparison is legitimate to the extent that Space Ghost perp is much darker and that really dark approach and his Southern roots have kind of landed him a lot of three 6 mafia comparisons which I can also kind of agree with to an extent I could definitely see parallels between mysterious funk and 1995's mystic styles of course the beats on this thing are more modern which is one separator but another separator between those two releases and this is not a good thing the darkness on this thing feels really forced and why is that because Space Ghost perp doesn't rap about anything dark the closest he comes doing that is maybe on the song paranoid and kind of the opening track to where he raps about being kind of a spiteful sort of hateful individual who's broken and lives in a cold world where you can't trust anybody because everyone's fake he dropped this cool line about shedding blood tears as they spell your name you the opening track has a really basic flow and is not the most lyrically dense or the most poetic song in the world but it paints a more unique picture than the rest of the tracks on here which pretty much just Muse about money hoes dick pussy violence haters which is becoming a more and more annoying subject to listen to when it comes to hip-hop music in today's day and age to be completely honest lyrically this album is just really one-dimensional it's just boring and of course it does not help that most of the songs on here don't really have a topic or a direction or a point and when a lyric doesn't actually stick out in a song it is pretty much only because it makes me cringe like this one line where he's going to be marrying music it sounds really cool like ASAP Rocky and definitely has its own kind of style but it's extremely weak lyrically but what kind of makes me favor ASAP Rocky a bit over purp is that perps words don't even really fit with the aesthetic or the the sound he's trying to push I think this album would be almost fantastic if most of the songs on your had some legitimately dark lyrics but instead you just kind of get this run-of-the-mill rap wolf dressed in dark and moody and tortured sheep's clothing I'm really kind of feeling strong five to a light six on this thing it's not terrible you know it's not the worst thing I've heard all year it's not even close to the worst hip-hop out my firt all year but I can't help but listen to this and just feel like man potential squander what did you guys think of this thing did you love it did you hate it why what should i review next and well yeah that's about it I love you and hope you're having a good day Anthony Fantana Space Ghost perp forever [Music] [Music] 
blVUxudkFYM,Oh hi everyone Anthony Phan Tiano here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review death spell Omega drought these guys are a French band kind of got its start playing black metal in the late 90s and early 2000s up until the point where they really made a huge change in direction and started mixing their black metal roots with progressive metal and technical metal since they started doing that they have been releasing some of the most interesting albums and EPS in black metal modern black metal peer hear hear hear hear it now when it comes to progressive and technical metal I tend to be very picky and you know it's only because a lot of bands that get labeled as being progressive or technical put together really bland lifeless plastic sounding recordings that really just don't sound good doesn't sound like I'm listening to a band it just kind of sounds like I'm listening to a machine or something I think I think abut death spell Omega steps away from all of that thankfully and just one track after another track delivers these really raw performances of twisting and sometimes nearly indecipherable metal songs and I really love the sound of the music on this EP the drums sound great they're really clear they're feeling so real so tangible so crisp you really get a sense of the way the kit sounds the guitars are really rugged they're textured they're rich sometimes there's a really dramatic Beauty to them like in the intro track which is very I guess kind of spacious a lot like an earth song the guitars are also fit for playing these extremely frenetic and fast riffs that cannot seem to really kind of sit still in a single groove for all too long constantly changing speed and direct and sometimes no real clear song structure comes out of the chaos that these guys are workers trading you get these really sour dissonant black metal chords you get the intricate drums and in grooves rhythms fills and on top of all of that these extremely just gruesome lead vocals throaty and the way that they're delivered throughout much of death spell omegas discography you don't really get a sense of singing as much as you do narration which isn't a surprise considering that these guys with their last full-length album finished a conceptual trilogy based on the theological relationship between God Satan and man technically and and compositionally and sonically production was there's a lot to praise however their music is not the easiest pill to swallow and believe it or not this album in the band's new EP are two of the most accessible releases in their discography for one this EP kind of breaks the mold of death spell Omegas past several eps and is not one or or a few very lengthy songs instead you get a grouping of six tracks that range from a minute thirty Seconds to foreign change like I said the opening track is really pretty just dark and moody the track following after fiery serpents though it is changing constantly shifting the riffs are pretty readable the track abrasive swirling murk earns its name easily he tons of drum fills that are nearly impossible to calculate but the improved recording quality that death spell is working with on this new EP actually makes the hectic chaos much easier to make sense of the closing track on here boughs out before I really would have liked it to but not before it starts incorporating a very faint group of chorus vocals that are pretty chilling in a very empathetic chord progression for the most part I feel like these tracks are kind of a continuation of a lot of the sounds that were on para Cletus death spell Omegas definitely not letting go of this more direct approach that they've been dealing with recently but now they're doing it with a better recording that makes them sound amazing this EP is basically a great way for death spell Omega to just say we still have great things coming after we have finished this trilogy and they're teasing toward it with what they're probably going to sound a lot like in the near future with a new LP with one of the best metal a EPS I've heard this year I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this EP what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana death spell Omega forever [Music] [Music] 
KjhQ78uoJGo,god that is a big cup hi my needle drops Anthony Fantana make it a quick video letting you know what my favorite albums are so far this year 12 right now on my website I have a loved list of my favorite releases so far this year I am NOT just going to straight-up list out all the releases that I liked or loved so far this year I kind of whittled my favorites down to 15 albums these albums I'm about to list have have definitely shown themselves to kind of be upper echelon kind of stuff in terms of you know what's really appealing to my tastes so listed in no particular order here are my 15 favorite albums so far from 2012 of course I think we all knew this out was gonna make it onto this list the new Fiona Apple LP the idler wheel is wiser than the driver of the screw and whipping horns will serve you more than ropes will ever do fantastic singer songwriter and album fiona's back sounding better than ever piano sounds great lyrics or stellar songs hooks it's all top-notch really no complaints just a solid friggin album next the self-titled portico quartet album these guys are an electronic music outfit that creates music that is just insanely inspired by jazz and is improvisational a lot of the time really blending genres and concepts you've really got to kind of listen to it to get a grasp of what it is the new perfume genius LP put your back into it another piano based singer-songwriter album really just emotional moving songs I love that Mike had Ria's really just improve the production improve the instrumentation just improve the overall presentation of his songs this time it's a stellar sophomore effort next every once in a while an album comes along that really just kind of turns your entire world upside down and makes you kind of rethink some things and one album like that this year has definitely been Death Grips the Money Store Jewelry intense electronics noise hip-hop it's a lot of things and so so so abrasive and so dark so so dark next this album is definitely a weirdo rock album in my opinion a freak rock album really making use of punk sludge party rock and kind of melding them with this very primitive simple caveman kind of vocal style that I liked a lot dope bodies natural history could not be more appropriately titled if you're looking for a rock record with a lot of energy and a lot of personality by all means next jazz trio bad bad not goods BB ng to jazz improvisational reinterpretations of hip hop sounds and hip hop songs great LP fantastic step up from their debut album that came out last year totally free loving what these guys are doing excited to hear what they're doing next another piano based singer-songwriter album soap and skins narrow despite the fact that I'm just so heartbroken over just how short this album is I'm very enthralled with it I'm enthralled with the sounds the sound of her voice the very forlorn attitude on this album which you know despite the fact that she is only on her sophomore effort and definitely not as big as perfume genius or Fiona Apple I feel like the emotional intensity of this record almost rivals those two artists she just has a lot of power in her singing in just her vocal delivery and the way she plays piano is well very sparsely very mournfully next definitely the most badass hardcore hip-hop album that you could listen to this year no question killer Mike's rap music man the beats on this thing are stellar all produced by LP and killer Mike himself just has a ton a ton of personality some great lyrics you know if you consider yourself to be a fan of like old Ice Cube or something like that this is definitely a must alright next LP a band that really kind of returned to form on their new album with a series of songs that I just think are are really great spiritual eyes sweet heart sweet life very luscious Lee arranged garage rock psych rock pop rock and some really great vocals and lyrics from Jason Pierce as usual next Billy woods history will absolve me really great kind of weird abstract hip hop album a number of different topics could touch down upon on the 19 tracks of this CD the beats are really colorful Billy has a very kind of unique rapping and flows style that will definitely jump out at you as as being at least somewhat unique while I know he's not going to be for everybody this definitely you know appealed to me in a big way this year this band with every single record they seem to be getting sweeter and sweeter and sweeter torches harmonic raft they're bringing just so many pop sensibilities into the world of sludge metal and hard rock and Curt Baloo of converge produced this record just like you did the last one the sounds are great the hooks are catchy the riffs are pretty stand out for the most part any not a lot of complaints this next record comes from a band that I actually think went darker with their newest release high on fire with dim Vermes Mysteries sludge metal elements of doom metal on this album as well high on fire sounds just heavier and overpowering than ever that pipes vocals are just so the guitars are distorted but also have elements of melody in there too the drums are just so relentless it's just a tough album next another tough album black breath sentenced to life this is just elements of death metal hardcore and thrash metal - all mixed into this fast furious and fiery whirlwind of just head banging non stopped throughout the entire record though I don't feel like this album is extremely groundbreaking or anything like that I just can't put it down I keep listening to it again and again and again it's like a greasy hamburger how can you say no getting down to the end of the list next loma prieta z-- IV though I did enjoy quite a bit of metal this year very abrasive very fast very loud music this definitely sticks out to me as being one of the most abrasive things I've heard this year new or old this thing with it's blast beats with its speed with it's very noisy grainy rough production and elements of just melody in there to really infusing Beauty into the ugly is a very just hyped up an interesting listen alright and last but not least lone with galaxy garden very awesome electronic music album bright fun well produced it's basically a tropical mixed drinks of electronic music albums for sure okay so this is my list what albums are on your list what albums have moved you what albums have gotten you excited what albums have opened your mind to new sounds and places and what elbows are just addictive and you just can't stop listening to let me know Anthony Fantana 2012 favorite albums 
Y8_RPvxcJ80,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd review time hot chips Hot Chip in our heads these guys are an English synth pop band with a strong emphasis on hooks and dance beats this is their fifth full-length LP it's self produced and out on Domino Records they've never really been one of my favorite bands in this style of music but I've always been impressed with the amount of homework that Hot Chip clearly does and has done when it comes to their genre they'll be futzing around with a lot of analogs since on some of their tracks and and the way these sequence them to will really call back to the golden days of synthesizer pop groups like OMD Simple Minds Depeche Mode the Human League new order they clearly have all these old-school influences but they bring a kind of fresh indie sensibility to their songwriting and and that pretty much allows them to get away with so many references to the past without feeling like a direct throwback now when it comes to song and melody writing hot chips approach is extremely simple and consciously so they really try to avoid complications whenever possible and instead shoot for an overwhelming sense of fun I always thought their vocals could use a little bit more personality I guess but they really make up for it for the most part with so many colourful and bouncy synthesizers guitars and rhythms that together just kind of pumped out grooves that I cannot say no to now these guys have been improving their overall sound sound quality production whatever you want to call it from album to album with their previous LP definitely be hermos were fined instrumentally and with this new LP Hot Chip is roughly going for the same sound same approach lots of layered intricate percussion an array of synth textures lots of friendly vocals very quirky attitude and songs that shoot for a variety of aesthetics in in dance music and electronica there's not really a world of change between this LP and their previous one the differences are very subtle maybe this album has more love songs on it but that's about it however I'm not trying to say that the band does not bring variety on this album sonically at least the song night and day is a completely unashamed dancefloor monster that I could see a band like chromeo covering very comfortably and the track nice chains is is very smooth soft and has a beat behind it that I could see being maybe a little bit more comfortable playing in the background of a burial song and the track look at where we are is one of the most legit slow jams of 2012 extremely sexy and the song motion sickness is such a blissful opener the world is round the world is and the part where everything spins I love the lyrics on this track it's really just a beat uplifting opener their songs on here where the backing instrumentation feels like it's influenced by house music and disco - especially the closer on here which I love but maybe slightly goes overboard with some spoken-word vocals kind of bordering in territory like I said there's a variety of songs on this album I could describe everyone as being definitely different and distinct from the others but what I think kind of ties this entire album together and this is something that I think Hot Chip has been getting better at doing with every new album the band's music just has this really sweet light innocent feel to it I could totally put this LP on in front of a six year old without really breaking a sweat or a 60 year old for that mater I'm not trying to insult Hot Chip or say that it's dumbed down or anything like that what I'm trying to illustrate is that I feel the music they make is just so beautifully universal of course that kind of direction is going to warrant some negativity when I put this album on myself I hated it this is just not for me this isn't my mood this is my attitude but the same innocence that was kind of turning me off at first as I listen to the album again and again actually ended up kind of you know melting the ice and made the album enjoyable at the end of the day I felt like a handful of tracks on here were a little underwhelming and maybe a bit too heavy-handed with some repetitive choruses I felt like hot chips for a into a more dubstep influenced rhythm was kind of just just okay if you're looking for a lot of electronic dance pop songs that are as colorful as the cover that you're seeing right here then give this a listen feeling a strong 7 to a like 8 on this but what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantan Oh Hot Chip 
n3uGWcb_Mzw,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd making a really quick video telling you about my favorite albums of this past month June listen I am NOT doing a big formal kind of you know nice camera video for this video because I just kind of want to do this quick because I'm not gonna have time to do this video this weekend instead this weekend I'm going to be making my favorite albums of 2012 so far videos so be on the lookout for that so like I said quickly I'm just going to name off my favorite releases of this past month you guys probably know many of them from the reviews at the start of this month I gave the new black breath album sentenced to life an extremely positive review very catchy blood pumping metallic hardcore that is out of this world that came out much earlier this year and I wasn't so hot on it at first but it really kind of came around on me ended up her viewing and freaking loved it next the new recon died album on acid really great electronic music very fragile beautiful I guess kind of delicate and really experiments with the sounds of acid house music and sort of puts them in a very kind of deep contemplative introspective I guess very chilly wintry kind of sound it's it's a great little mix of songs not really quite I guess a structured album has a few remixes on it really does feel like a collection of tracks but it is a friggin good collection of tracks next the new tallest man on earth album if you consider yourself a fan of singer songwriters you love acoustic music you just love people who finger pick guitar sing a sweet tune this guy is a must listen he is just so freaking kin and this is just another great album in the light of albums that he's put out so far and I look forward to seeing what this guy does next I mean he's so good at what he does you know to the point where he doesn't really need to do any sort of bold changes from album to album though there are some obvious instrumental shifts on this new LP and will be interesting to see where he takes that on future albums he's just pretty much delivering the same kind of passion and songwriting and guitar playing technical ability that you expect from him alright next record I am am I Who am I can Swedish sent the pop album that I didn't think I would like it all but I ended up just thinking was fantastic it's just incredibly catchy well produced sounds a lot like one of my favorite artists Fever Ray one of the reasons I was kind of hesitant to listen to it or enjoy it when I first put it on but it just ended up being so infectious so passionate that I just couldn't say no next the new Fiona Apple album the idler wheel is wiser than the driver of the screw and whipping quartz will serve you more than ropes will ever do great album from her stripped back a little bit in comparison to her last album but the songs are extremely potent her lyrics are great vocal delivery stellar piano playing Bam Bam piano playing good and the band she plays with is just fantastic on the album the upright bass sounds great the drumming sounds great and just the story she tells she just continues down this path that you would expect from her in a way you know it's it's definitely these very bitter relationship obsessed style songs where you know you really see Fiona suffering from a myriad of emotional problems but it's just so great she's just such a monster at it she's so good at just projecting her emotions in a song and really making the listener feel for her and I think this album is much better at that in comparison with her laughs LP she's definitely sounding better than ever taking her usual style and sound and really kind of making it relevant you know in the in the handful of years I believe seven you know that took her to come out with this new LP and last album that I want to mention the new ty Segall Siegel Segal album slaughterhouse the ty Segall Band album slaughterhouse and he came out

j2VypHw0AD4,what is he doing hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review old man gloom no these guys are a doom metal act a sludge metal act whose members respectively are involved in other seminal and and pretty well respected groups and extreme music Isis converge doom riders cave-in not only do these guys have a ton of experience in bands outside of old man and gloom but they have four previous albums with this group and this is their first LP in eight years plus on top of all these cool little nifty background facts Kurt blew of converge has been handling the production on this album the riffs on this thing really concentrate on that low-end earthquake tanks rolling by two ton week getting dropped bombs going off what can I say to make you understand how heavy this album is just how violent some of the rumbles are on this album from the ambient intro to the song common species right after where you've got all these really slow chugging riffs where the band will just really hit a note and let it ring out no matter the volume or the speed old man gloom is playing at you feel these guitars I actually feel like one slight letdown kind of right off the bat with this album is that it could've maybe been a little louder a little more extreme what sort of separates these guys from from other bands that are do metal sludge metal influenced by metal Korn and punk as well is how willing these guys are to experiment with ambient music to very few bands are this loud in this extreme and are able to kind of go back and forth between those two genres so tastefully and this is especially true on this album where if you compare what their last you had the hardcore the sludge the doom separate from the ambient moments here old man gloom just marries the two transitioning one sound and to another sound on this album and with these ambient textures these these prettier textures old man gloom adds a lot of character to these songs which without these these extra sounds would pretty much be with machines I love the really giant heavenly chorus that really reminds me of torch quite a bit at the end of the song carry the flame or the forking paths track which has this really kind of industrial interlude toward the end of it where you hear this metallic banging and clanging against what kind of sounds like noise coming from a heavily distorted bass the closing track on here hits a really huge climax with shots of what kind of sounds like just brittle ear shattering white noise there are ambient moments on here that feel almost godspeed like and the song rats has this introduction where the rumbles are so kind of heavy and and strange other-worldly they feel like a giant beast awaking from a century-long slumber I love the sounds on this thing or but I can't help but feel like some of the ambient moments some of the extra sounds on this album are a little bit of window dressing because what is really at the core of some of these songs almost every one of these tracks I can't help but feel like the riffs really aren't all that all that distinctive from the grooves that they're laying out to the notes that they're playing which is kind of sad because it feels like old man gloom put enormous effort into making there and moment sound freakin amazing I wish the vocals changed up more outside of the the last few moments on the album you kind of get a an acoustic ballad which is decent and and the vocals do feel a bit more emotive on the last track when they are screaming but for the most part you just get this constant unwavering scream that track after track after track I just kind of feel like I start tuning out and I just wasn't really all that enthralled with some of the chord progressions on the album - especially when the band would do something dark and kind of melodic from the first few tracks that I heard I thought this was just gonna be pretty unique and heavy experience and I did get the heavy I did but I just didn't find a lot of a lot of staying power between these tracks despite the fact that the old man gloom definitely has a unique angle with this ambient sludge doom combination I just wish they put more character into the the loud or heavier moments on here kind of feeling a decent - strong six on this album what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why where do you see this album in terms of old man glooms older LPS and what should I hurt you next anthony Fantana old man gloom no forever 
G-jE0gcdL9w,it's 2:00 a.m. that's a normal work schedule hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a double review ty Segall and white fence hair and ty Segall band slaughterhouse gone see ty go go go go go go go go ty Segall is a california garage rock artist he blew up several years ago back when the sounds of lo-fi rock recordings and garage punk were the hottest sounds that the blogosphere had to offer and at the time I was heading into J retard I was having the black lips but I never really fell too hard for what ty Segall was doing for the most part it was garage punk with a subtle psyche Rock influence he had some really chaotic production too just so friggin noisy and he just fronted his songs with these very over-the-top vocals recorded with just this very very brittle sharp bouncy echo he kind of reminded me of the Oh C's a bit at the time and though I didn't really hate it it just didn't click with me though I do admire the energy that he put into a lot of his tracks he is just a one-man powerhouse he really just kind of cuts his stomach open and dumps his guts all over some of his tracks especially on his 2008 self-titled LP which was really just kind of an experiment in high volumes and just raw guitar drum simplicity ever since this LP I think ty Segall has kind of gone back and reverted a bit to his previous LP horn the unicorn where there was a bit more variety a bit more detailed to some of the songs not every one of them was so loud and noisy and hard-hitting but even though I think ty Segall is being a little easy around the ears these days with some of his solo stuff and you know adding more detail and whatnot he still manages to keep it rough around the edges very fun and very freakish at this point ties it all has over five albums under his belt and you know even though his fans kind of come to expect a certain thing from him he never quite likes to deliver it in the same exact way while he's always wallowing in the world garage rock with a loaf I'd twist to me his albums just are this never-ending exploration of ways to make the sounds of psychedelic rock garage rock and punk just noisier weirder more unsettling wild and sweaty but even though a lot of times music is just rife with this experimentation he never really loses sight of having a good time when it comes to this style of music though it is not as hot now as it was a few years ago on the whole I feel like he's one of the few people out there at this moment who are still bringing some surprises he's really kind of carrying the torch for this kind of stuff now he's at the forefront of the pack with this sound and he's pushed himself there this year with two new releases a collaboration with White Fence and a new album with his ty Segall band the first time he's releasing an album under that title now in regards to the collaboration with White Fence ty Segall and White Fence are cut from roughly the same lo-fi cloth with some noticeable differences the last few White Fence records even though Rock does influence this guy they really kind of left me feeling like he is so much more of a sound experimentalist than a guy who really wants to kind of pound out a rock song that's gonna get fist pumping thinking just bodies jumping out of windows and stage diving and all that good fun time happy good stuff and kind of in theory I could see this collaboration working out really one way tie brings the badass guitar riffs brings the energy White Fence brings the eccentricity the color a little bit of weirdness and in the end you kind of get a group of very colorful detailed oddball garage rock tunes with a psychedelic edge that have got a lot of energy and force behind them and I would say fantasy you know she though this LP is short it makes up for it with a lot of highlights the track I am a game has this really kind of kooky keyboard on it it's a really just tough tense driving garage rock tune with a very slow heavy site rock breakdown and I love how the transition from point A to point B lots of grace interplay there are even more psychedelic elements on the track the black glove slash rag which has some just classic rock gold in the drum fills and the interjecting wailing guitar leads just popping in here and there and the lo-fi feel on the track actually kind of turns the song a little bit into somewhat of a 60s throwback the song is catchy and the vocals on the track just have this really kind of lethargic weird quality to them that really makes this very tried-and-true sound feel mutated and kind of uncomfortable in a memorable and somewhat enjoyable way but if you want to talk about something being mutated listen to the song cry-baby which sounds like a more muscular version of the riff from the Beatles song The Ballad of John and Yoko the song just has everything so freaking loud claustrophobic close to the mic it sounds like a bunch of practice amps with three stomp distortion boxes just turn all the way up playing it once and I don't know it's it's being performed within my skull and it's throbbing plus the song has this badass 50s R&B style boogie woogie piano solo the solo really kind of sounds like it's on cocaine and just really kind of hops in and brings the song to an entirely different level the song scissor people has such hard-hitting guitars really the noisiest track on here and I love how they start playing with the left and right channels with some of the guitar distortion on that track and the last song on here has a great groove and as Tai and White Fence bring the song closer to the finish line it appears more and more kind of like a jam session you know this collaboration has a lot of kind of 60s Kitsch to it but some colorful eccentricities get added along the way of course that awesome ty Segall garage punk energy is thrown into the equation - just a short sweet garage and psychedelic freak out really infectious energy behind hair I feel like the lazy kind of laid-back lethargic vocals do strip a few songs of their personality especially the first and the third track the melodies on those songs don't feel that strong so I wish the vocals kind of came out and just brought more emotion but otherwise this is just a really great fantastic listen feeling a light eight on this thing did you love it did you hate it etc next review ty Segall band slaughterhouse this thing is a different animal emphasis on animal big claws ripping your face apart eating you as you are alive it's gruesome this thing of these two reviews is the bruiser now of course this is the the first record that ty is dropping under the ty Segall band name but this is not the first time ty has been in a band the perverts sick Alps the traditional fools party foul but despite all this experience of previous bands and previous ty Segall records ty really kind of takes the sounds he's been evolving on his past few albums and really kind of goes extreme with them brings them to a new level this album in a way I actually kind of see ty taking the badassness of his self-titled album a handful of years ago but actually kind of translating into a full band context and ty brings on people he's comfortable working with like Michael me Kael Cronin to kind of get the job done now even though this thing is not a metal album it's about as close you're going to get on a garage rock LP want some wailing guitar leads just heavy distorted tuff is nails riffs and just a really forceful energy behind these tracks there's really Live feel to this album that I love you'll sometimes hear ty talking before or after songs really counting some of these songs off and even though there are some moments where you might catch a bass flub or maybe a drum hit is slightly off or something like that the energy is just something else Trax 7 through 10 on this album are some of the shortest on this LP and they kind of blitzkrieg their way to the finish line of this album just throwing out one hard-hitting riff after another even though this is just really kind of words cannot be said for how hyped up these songs are I do feel like ty Segall loses a little bit of flavor in in some of these tracks when he just sort of takes off without adding a detail but some of the longer songs on here definitely kind of balance that out and are just as badass the opening track death feels just like that although the vocals are not that hard-hitting I wish they were a little more abrasive I'm just nothing but noises tonight the guitar distortion and feedback on that song it's just heavy the song I bought my eyes just has these tough distorted chords that are just ripping my skull open grindy argument and all of the guitar leads on that track - and they get all harmonized and and just so colorful it's a nice contrast and even though ty Segall is getting really kind of hard and heavy on this album there are some subtle psychedelic sort of sort of pretty melodic well-written elements to these songs and details you know what I'm saying for example the descending chord progression on the song wave goodbye definitely reminds me of something pulled from the Beatles playbook and the song what's inside your heart the vocals on that track even sound like a Beatles esque vocal harmony just singing over this very hellish riff it's kind of just one solid tune after another and it all kind of finishes with this 10-minute drone noise guitar feedback piece that let me add this album would be as short as hair if it were not for this song the title is appropriately fuzz war and though it is not one of my favorite parts on the album it definitely has a nice cacophony to it and kind of highlights how noisy and distorted and abrasive ty is trying to be with with this album especially on the song diddie wa diddie has the most insane vocals on this entire album just screaming bloody screaming there's not much more I can say other than I think ty has pulled together to the better easily garage rock albums this year with the White Fence collaboration and slaughterhouse while it still kind of bugs me on this slaughterhouse album that ty obscures his vocals a little bit more than I would like him to on some tracks especially death I do think he is writing some solid tunes there was a great musicianship and interplay between him and the types of gal band on this album really tight you know it's great to hear a band that can just be so kind of off the cuff and it sounds great so I'm feeling too light too decent eight on this LP what did you guys think of this and hair did you love them hate them why and what should I review next anthony Fantana ty Segall Fred [Music] [Music] 
7rw9WkF4lPY,you were that foundation never gonna be another one no I follow so take it so conditioned I could never let go oh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review open mike eagle animal hospital open mike is a creative witty kind of eccentric California rapper one-third of the thirsty fish hip hop trio and if I'm not mistaken this is his fourth full-length album for Mike really smart-mouthed out of the box hip hop has kind of always been his style from 2010 unapologetic art wrap to last year's rappers will diet natural causes even the dude's album titles are ahead of the curve and his overall style and his flow is a huge influence on my low Mike even featured Milo on an EP that he put out recently too this album maybe doesn't have Mike's boldest or most humorous statements to date but because he's stuck with one producer throughout this entire album it really does have the most consistent feel of all his releases awkward is a producer from the UK and he brought a really electronic feel to this album the beats and the rhythms really groove you know really have a sense of momentum to them you know I guess but as far as the sins go a lot of the samples it all feels kind of robotic the synthesizers on this thing can range from being really kind of glossy and smooth to very sort of distorted chaotic kind of glitchy there's just synthesizers of different shapes and sizes all over this LP I really think that the beats on this thing bring sounds that Flying Lotus fans would love anybody who's a fan of just brain feet or records subtract - there are a lot of instances where hip-hop and electronic music do not marry well for me a lot of it depends on the personality of the emcee and the thing is Mike is just quirky and strange enough to make it work and when he makes a point he does it pretty well like on the song Hospital which is just this introspective self-improvement track I guess sort of checking yourself and looking back on the time when I guess you weren't the person you wanted to be another topical track that I like a lot even though I'm not really in love with the singing on the hook is backpack past which is hilarious and features Mike kind of giving advice to now irrelevant backpack rappers as to how they can transition into this new rap scene and sort of tongue-in-cheek recommends doing doing doing heroin getting some skinny jeans doing some R&B and the song the financial crisis that wouldn't go away if you were ever looking for I guess a musical guide to our current financial crisis that's it some of the topical tracks on here don't really do it for me either they seem too outlandish kind of like dance bills or they are so short they kind of derail the flow of the album even though I do think they kind of hit upon a very important topic kind of like the song Deb it's where Mike really tears apart the concept of putting yourself thousands of dollars into debt just to kind of get a degree that's not getting you anywhere in life as far as the free range tracks on here go shits technical like Francis Ford Coppola scenes a bad analogy since I don't know what it means Mike kind of crafts lots of weird funny lines like that his style isn't really in creating tongue-twisters spitting fire or throwing out layered lines just covered in coded language Mike is more enjoyable for his his personality his nobility I just kind of came out of this album with a list of pros and cons I feel like some tracks could have been longer I am on the fence with some of the hooks and when Mike isn't really telling a story with a certain song a clear story some of his lines just kind of go in one ear and out the other I did kind of grab a loose concept on this album which I kind of liked where I heard Mike throughout the album kind of being coached by the studio engineer in between songs who I guess is holding him captive but I'm just kind of getting tidbits of that I wish there was a stronger connection between the tracks and regards to whatever kind of concept or theme Mike was trying to bring together Mike has a really kind of unique and great sound and style but I don't feel like the assembly and the execution is is top-notch though all the time still really good listen feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana open my eagle 
GX0CdRiz9xY,it's too hot for an intro still what still oh-oh-oh-oh I'm getting real good at sweating my my needle drops it's time for a review the Smashing Pumpkins Oceania this is the ninth studio LP from famed alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins a band who really made their mark on the 1990s with some of the most critically acclaimed albums to come out of that decade the very rough and psychedelic Gish the catchy Aaron and more refined Siamese Dream the epic ambitious double album Mellon Collie and the infinite sadness as well as the not as hot but more goth tinged adore which brought a little bit more electronics into the fold too with the pumpkins music these guys had their lineup changes over the course of their career and they were on a serious streak up until about the 2000s they kind of opened up the millennium with what was supposed to be their last record machina a concept album that was kind of a decent return to their alt rock sound considering that adore definitely left them in a different spot when fans had last heard a studio album from them in the early 2000s death was definitely knocking on the Smashing Pumpkins doorstep and they just kind of called it quits and then after years of side projects solo efforts in 2007 the Smashing Pumpkins decided to get back together with a different lineup Billy Corrigan was there Jimmy Chamberlin was back on drums and the band kind of seemed to return where where they left off with a new album titled zeitgeist and when I say left off you were mocking a left off which had its its pros and it's cons there were definitely some moments on this LP that fell especially heavy but the lyrics left a lot to be desired even though they were kind of taking a surprisingly political shift in in message the guitars are so loud but so just like muddy and and hearing guitars recorded like that is like drinking sour milk Jimmy Chamberlain's drums are just stashed all the way in the back could barely really make out a lot of the subtleties however Billy Corrigan has not given up in refining the pumpkins sound in this phase of their career and recently he's been putting out material as the Smashing Pumpkins with a new lineup and sort of working on this project called tear guard and by kaleidoscope where the pumpkins are kind of putting out songs one by one in small bits and then releasing them as EPS as time moves on but Oceania has kind of interrupted the flow of that project in a way maybe I guess it's supposed to be a part of that series however it's really no secret that the Smashing Pumpkins were not getting all that much attention or success from this new one by one song release format so now we're back to an album format 13 songs in one big bunch and while the Smashing Pumpkins stylistically are not really at the forefront of much of anything anymore they do sound good on this LP they avoid a lot of the older guitar tones and and some of the older riffs something I don't really feel like they tried to do all that much on zeitgeist which in addition to all the other issues made it sound dated though slightly I would say it's a loss of their trademark sound this is I know how you want the Smashing Pumpkins to feel in 2012 now I'm sure there are fans on the internet that are praising this record simply because the band has managed to put out a better album than zeitgeist and for sure that has happened but I would argue that you know this album does function beyond that the songs on this thing bring a mix of both heavy and delicate moments it's multifaceted dimensional just like you would want a Smashing Pumpkins album to be but I do feel like one side of the cell peak goes over better than the other the Achilles heel for me on Oceania are the louder tracks like the opening track on this thing quasar it actually made me want to just turn the album off right from the start though I think it is the loudest riff on this LP it's incredibly tame and just proof that the Smashing Pumpkins are just nowhere near as ferocious as they used to be I feel the same way about the next track on this LP panopticon but I do feel like it goes down easier because it is a more melodic track and focuses on Billy Corgan songwriting a bit more as opposed to just yeah plus the track features all these very rich just beautiful harmonized guitar leads that that pop up on quite a few tracks on here which really bring a very bright quality to this album and then just Smashing Pumpkins sound an aesthetic on this LP in general though there are still those moody spots that you would expect from a pumpkin this album this thing is definitely feeling like a bright blue sky totally cloudless sun is shining air is warm there's a light breeze kind of like that it's like a brand-new day those harmonized guitar leads get really hyped up and played at a faster tempo on the track chimera toward the end of this album and they get played so fast in just such a lively way that it feels like the smashing come they're kind of playing pop-punk like I said just a lot of louder spots on here feel either just weak or a little too sugary where I think this LP gets great are the quieter moments that's where Billy Corgan songwriting really stands out and you start getting those beautiful just breathtaking symphonic rock tracks that call back to some of the best moments on melancholy songs like the Celestials violent Ray's my love is winter one diamond one heart those songs are all next to each other and they're really quite the streak on this LP lots of moody hooks that just burst with heavy guitars and synthesizers lots of melody Billy's voice sounds great the acoustic break on my love is winter freakin rules and sadly after that I kind of feel like this LP falls apart on the title track oceania Billy Corgan songwriting is is great there's a lot of changes in instrumentation but then they try to drag it out to nine minutes and kind of fall short in the process there's a nice acoustic breakdown but then it morphs into this synth rock part that doesn't really go anywhere and just kind of bhau's out fades out before anything interesting really happens it's really a letdown it's kind of like being kicked out of a party after the title track on here I have a hard time describing a lot of the songs on this LP because I feel like they are so nondescript their songs on here that definitely kind of feel like revamped versions of songs that have already been on smash pumpkins albums but are kind of performed with this brighter richer sound that the Smashing Pumpkins are working with right now songs like pale horse and an inkless for sure the final track on this LP is very pretty song it's it's a decent closer and overall I just kind of come away from this album feeling like I said I just heard a brighter more modern version of these Smashing Pumpkins that that I'm used to there are points at this LP that do feel a bit complacent like Billy Corgan is is a little too intent on kind of serving up the same old Smashing Pumpkins sound but just altered ever so slightly and while that has made this album enjoyable for me it really hasn't turned into love I guess all the way through because there are spots on here that do kind of feel like a formulaic bore I'm kind of feeling a decent two strong six on this album which I know you know doesn't seem like that amazing but I'm actually pretty happy about it considering I thought I was gonna go into this album hating it so it was pretty nice for to just kind of turn around on me actually surprise me with some very enjoyable songs that make me look forward to the next Smashing Pumpkins release so what did you guys think of this album did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next and what do you think of the Smashing Pumpkins at this point in their career and Billy carrying on the name and and all that jazz hmm let me know Anthony Fantana the Smashing Pumpkins [Music] 
mSZRS7f5MTc,hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a question comment thing sometimes I am pretty surprised at the amount of emails or personal messages or tweets that I will get asking me to not just recommend music in general you know that's not surprising what's surprising is people well specifically and asked for me to recommend to them depressing albums I guess I'm surprised that that a notable amount of people are interested in albums that I don't know either feature the artist being audibly depressed or an album that may sort of force those feelings upon them are you looking to kind of dabble in depression sort of be a voyeur to it are you yourself depressed and are looking for an album to kind of heal that or to have some kind of I guess solace in that somebody else out there is feeling the same emotions that you are I am curious as to where this kind of curiosity stems I guess because while I do enjoy quite a few albums or artists who are considered to be very depressing like Elliott Smith or even Bright Eyes of course as well I feel like I enjoy them especially Elliott Smith for their musicality more than I do just simply their depression to just kind of label Elliott Smith or or any of the artists that I'm going to name as just simply depressing music I feel like is a bit of an insult to how amazing of a songwriter Elliott was on his best records and how he and a lot of these artists that I'm about to name were not only great when it came to writing music but had a certain sound so what makes for a depressing record a depressing song it's really all up to interpretation for one the Neutral Milk Hotel album in the aeroplane over the sea hits me with strong feelings of depression and and sadness because of its its lyrical themes mostly dealing with ideas like death and loss other artists really kind of give me these downer feelings because of their their lyrics as well but for different reasons especially bright eyes who Zuzu's you'll find frontman Conor Oberst lyrics to be extremely just straightforward yet poetic and very kind of self-loathing at times and even like a hip-hop album or a full album anything that is kind of telling a real gritty story of things the way they are whether it is a story about drug abuse or living an impoverished life or some kind of war injustice going on I mean that to me is is kind of dark and depressing too you know like bright eyes and like Elliot Smith there are some people whose personalities in their songs just have such a sad and just dreary aura around them on some records most definitely Nick Drake Bonnie Prince Billy - and then there are some rock bands whose lyrics yeah they do have a dark edge to them but for the most parts their sound to me that that brings the sadness most notably Joy Division heading further into the sound direction there are plenty of depressive black metal albums out there that that definitely will bring those feelings no questions asked and there's some artists whose very nihilistic approach to music and sound is is definitely you know not something that gets my blood pumping that gets me really excited really just kind of numbs my mind down and just makes me think man this is just messed up talking about son talking about wolf eyes talking about suicide have a nice life swans and you know Godspeed you black Emperor to I I would say but Godspeed you know is is different in that man the heavy layers of instrumentation it's just darkness and depression orchestral style oh and Simon joiner got to mention that guy and Nick Cave Nick Cave must be mentioned as well and Scott Walker and let's not forget about all that old school tear in your beer country some really depressing songs and and so on subjects coming from the likes of Patsy Cline Johnny Cash mmm Hank Williams while depressing music can be kind of fantastic you know really be there at the right place the right time make you feel very reflective and introspective for a moment let's not forget to enjoy all those emotional flavors this is just one piece of the puzzle and like I said it really kind of depends on you what music to you is depressing really kind of is a downer to you let me know yeah Anthony Fantana depressing music forever [Music] 
XQbBEdzZbaU,it's too hot for an intro what Wyatt Wyatt Wyatt Wyatt hahaha hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review metric synthetic metric the famed ontario rock band with strong ties to Broken Social Scene thanks to the band's front woman Emily Haines who actually has some pretty fantastic solo material that I would listen to if I were you go listen to it but this new LP heads in a direction that metrics last album fantasies kind of helped put them in going back to their first LP metric pretty much always had a very I guess simple straightforward fun kind of unoffensive indie rock sound whose boldest characteristics were probably Emily Haines synth playing and and her singing and metric sound has just grown more and more polished over time and Synthetica is their most polished album yet like the title suggests I get kind of a synthetic feel from some of these tracks for the opening hits and it's very atmospheric it's very glossy the guitars have a lot of shine on them once they eventually kick in and the keyboards to the really big kind of electrified presentation reminds me a little bit of a Coldplay album especially the song breathing underwater but in Metrix case the the music comes off nowhere near as well produced as well written or kind of performed all that well performed with any energy because a lot of these songs to me just feel really flat really kind of robotic let's take it back to the first track on this album there is such a buildup on the introduction of of this track and it's all for pretty much just bringing things into a very very lifeless drum beat with no real push behind it and tracks on here that have a bit of a stronger groove on them like the second song Youth without youth don't really feel a little bit like kind of a new way you've throw back but not really in a good way it feels kind of restrained and and restricted and has these cheesy vocoder vocals over this bluesy hook it just reminds me of the really awkward transitions that bands such as Gang of Four or public image limited or the clash made as they were trying to adapt to some of the trendier sounds in the 80s metric doesn't have the same reputation and that those bands do when it comes to living up to their name on this album but the things metric doesn't really have the same kind of pressures that those bands did to change into this kind of aesthetic which is why it's so confusing that they would continue to suck the rock energy out of their songs you know punk has never really been a major element of metrics music a major major element but it was kind of necessary to get this bands very simplistic straightforward songs across and and make them kind of catchy exciting somewhat thrilling instead we're just kind of getting some forgettable synth pop songs on here the title track on here has a bit of a surprise in that it is kind of driving really kind of energetic I'm liking the guitars on that track it's feeling much more I guess engaging than any of the other songs on this LP and another surprise is the second last track which actually has a Lou Reed vocal feature now I know a lot of you guys were probably still sour with Lou Reed because of Lou Lou but I have to say that on this new metric album it is just a huge misuse of his voice and his personality they're really trying to get him to sing over these hyper harmonious ultra synthetic in deep toons and it's just not a good match it sounds kind of like hearing Captain Beefheart's screaming Avant poetry over the Postal Service's debut album and the thing is Lou isn't even really mixed all that well in the track I mean I know the guy is getting up there in age but don't bury him yet especially not in cheesy sense you know if an album is going to make a conscious decision to not be bold or adventurous or inventive in any way then it should at least be catchy or energetic or pretty but I would say this album falls short when it comes to those things - overall just kind of feeling a strong three maybe a light four on this LP you know I can kind of get or see the appeal as to why people would dig on it but it is just so not for me what did you guys think of this album did you love it did you hate it why what should I review next and yeah that's about it Anthony Fantana metric Synthetica forever 
ktsk_xYWl7s,it's so hot I broke seven dk7 BK dance set BK dance hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review currency the stoned immaculate this guy's in New Orleans rapper who has been edit for well over a decade at this point and despite the really laid-back sound of his music this guy grinds he is prolific early in his career he kind of got his start rapping for masterpiece 504 boys but then when that folded he managed to land on little Wayne's label Young Money and on Young Money in album for currency never really seemed to pan out but he was being crafty at the time in kind of putting things together through his own record label and releasing just relentlessly a non-stop series of mixtapes eventually Young Money let him go he put out his debut album and just has continuously put out albums and mixtapes since and he has really kind of developed his own sound he has a pretty set style very smooth just simple instrumentals complemented with his very understated kind of blunted flow and vocal delivery and lyrics that kind of seemed to be an ongoing Journal of stories and and musings about his jet life ethos we're basically currency is high all day and kind of living in the lap of luxury now when this style currencies been gaining quite a bit of momentum his albums pilot talk 1 & 2 that came out in 2010 definitely gotten quite a bit of wreck Nishan and he followed those albums up with even more material in 2011 and now in 2012 we have these stoned immaculate and this is by far not the only thing currency has put out this year it's not even the first release he's done for his new record label Warner Brothers but it is the biggest project that currency has put out so far mmm because this time around with this LP you really start to feel that Warner Brothers budget behind currencies work getting some big-name features on here whether it's Big KRIT 2 Chainz wale Wiz Khalifa and Pharrell currency's instrumentals still have that very smooth simple makeup but they sound way more glamorous this time around with tons of strings and piano and horns there's a beautiful harp that opens this album up right at the intro track it's kind of like imagining currency performing live at the most expensive Country Club in the Hamptons currency definitely has a bigger presentation this time around but the thing that consistently is just boring with currencies music from release to release is also really a letdown for me on this album the rapping yeah I get that it's cool I get that it's chill and that it's laid-back but I just do not see the appeal of hearing this guy moan and mumble through 13 tracks straight and most of these tracks are about the same stuff it's kind of like watching the same exact rap video over and over and over and over but it's kind of shot at a different angle every time or the setting changes oh it's on a yacht now oh wait hold on we're in a mansion oh wait we're on a jet and the thing is the way he raps about luxury if it's not even all that unique or insightful in any way sometimes you do kind of get a whiff of wordplay from a verse here and there which is really something some reviewers are on and on about when it comes to currency and praising him but I just don't see that here I feel like he does try to break up the monotony throw out a track about his youth his personal desires why he is the person he is or a song about a relationship that just didn't pan out but it's just kind of one surface-level story after another that is either a giant fantasy or really could have happened to anybody just bland stories over expensive beats that in a nutshell is what this album is to me there's some stomach-churning R&B hooks on here and a bad auto-tune chorus from from The Neptunes of all people and while we're mentioning them the features on this thing are just not that good but the thing is it's not like curtain see raises the bar all that high and I don't mean that kind of high to me the instrumentals are the only redeeming thing this album has to offer and I don't even really like them that much I'm really feeling strong to to a like 3 on this album didn't enjoy it not even really a little what did you guys think of it did you like it did you hate it why and what should I review next currency the stone immaculate forever [Music] [Music] 
-2BfsmZSyD8,did you do the thing okay yeah he's gay but you guys that packing like this can't be good for your throat bro bro bro bro call it arson hi I'm hi hi hi everyone Anthony Fantan Oh your Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review bobby womack the bravest man in the universe this is the latest full-length album from ohio singer and songwriter Bobby Womack whose career spans both many years and many genres gospel funk doo-wop R&B and many more but he's best known as a soul singer despite a lot of talent a very strong voice with a very distinct personality and having written a nice handful of chart-topping singles in the 60's 70's and these Bobby's career has kind of been dwindling as well as his health unfortunately but some recent projects he's been involved in like singing the lead single off the last gorillas album performing with that live as well as being on there the fall album as well it's kind of revitalized his career and his passion as well all of the new attention on this man's voice and just his abilities has kind of snowballed into this new Damon Albarn produced studio LP and it's a collection of kind of progressive spacey colorfully produced soul songs that remind me of a few things for one the more cleanly produced tracks that bobby was putting out in the 80s as well as that strong gorillas style beat production and there's actually quite a bit of moments on this that remind me in a positive way in a positive way of Lana Del Rey is born to die and how the songs on this LP kind of have a myriad of different topics and moods but I think this whole LP kind of boils down to a vocal sample on the fourth track of this thing where you hear someone talking about a singer when they get up in age they have lived life a little bit more and because of that better understand the stories and the emotions that they're trying to convey in their songs and that is clearly the strength of Bobby on this record age has had its pros and cons on his voice and any limitations he is suffering from on this LP are just easily made up for by how well-traveled and an emotional he sounds singing on these tracks right from the intro track Bobby is singing against just this weeping cello about the bravest man in the universe being the one who can forgive first but eventually these echoing pianos start rolling in really delicately and there's just this over-the-top kind of theatrical energy to it that almost reaches a David Bowie kind of level please forgive my heart is the next track on this album the first single from this LP actually and it is just a really nice crisp modern beat with Bobby's fantastic vocals over it it feels like being gently spun on a merry-go-round underneath a starry sky the next track on your deeper River Bobby is pretty much doing a solo acoustic guitar kind of thing really chills the album out putting quickly into the tracklisting I thought Diggler reflection is actually the song on here that features Lana Del Ray on vocals and it's actually not that bad you know I don't really care for her voice all that much but the the piano chords are really sultry I wish the beat changed things up a little bit more hmm the tracks stupid is is about religious greed and has a very punchy beat nice bright piano chords it's a catchy song with a potent message and the song if there wasn't something there is just heart-wrenching however I don't think this album ends all that strongly though the song love is gonna lift you up which to me kind of feels like Bobby's story with this album that if you're still alive if there's love there there's a chance for a new beginning there's a chance for a new day there's a chance for the the Sun to shine again the lyrics feel kind of corny to be completely honest but they're sincere and I feel like with the right production they could really kind of hit home and people could really understand and and get into the message of the song but for some reason the song is just slathered in these really fake synthetic scents and it just sounds so it's like they were conscious of how corny the lyrics out-of-context with this song would sound so they just decided to purposely surround it with corny production to I don't know bring the corniness pout and the song nothing can save you is another vocal feature on here but it doesn't really add anything to this album that the the Lana Del Rey track didn't already add and the thing is that track didn't even really add that much I feel like neither of the vocal collaborations on this album feel all that collaborative there's not all that much chemistry between Bobby and whoever is a guest on the track they're just kind of trading spaces in the verses and not really doing much else the last song on here let's lose it's an interesting track it's kind of like a stop and clap Blues screamer but of course is backed up with sequence drums and synthesizer it's got a cool message about not letting other people get in your way of your passions your goals whatnot it's not really much of an ending to me kind of an anti climactic ending I guess you know I'm just kind of torn on this thing the special moments on this album are really special are just stellar but the soso tracks just kind of hold things back a lot of underwhelming moments on this album and not because these guys wanted to really get this album done fast and just throw it in the can it seems like they were more eager to kind of jump on to the next idea the next kind of experimentation the next adventure as opposed to finishing this one thing and really fleshing it out and making it something great so while I do like this album and maybe not even a ton I do think there is something special about the aesthetic of the cell either something special about Bobby's voice his personality and the personality of the best songs on this album I would love to see Bobby put out another album next year or the year after I hope this is not just a one-shot thing I know this record has not been one of the hottest to come out this year so I hope that doesn't prevent him from releasing new material in the near future but we're gonna see I'm feeling a strong sex on this LP what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Bobby Womack forever you 
A6dKpFq0IxU,bring-bring cal Chooch esta how are you good you know there's a business meeting outside I should probably go sounds important hi everybody my needle drops Anthony Fantana your Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Fiona Apple the idler wheel is wiser than the driver of the screw and whipping chords will serve you more than ropes will ever do this is her first full-length album in about seven years and in the internet age even taking a few years to come out with your new album seems to be becoming a longer and longer time so I think there may be some people watching who aren't necessarily one after % familiar with Fiona Apple her style her work and everything like that but she's the kind of artist who you don't necessarily need to go scope all of her older albums in order to appreciate what she does because she's been so consistent in her sound and her style with album after album just slinging these piano rock tunes backed by drum and acoustic bass and on all of her albums as well including this one Fiona shows that mark of a great songwriter in that she can send a really strong emotional connection with the listener through her music make the emotions feel tangible for the listener even if the story in the song is very personal or difficult to relate to not only does Fiona have this characteristic but I would say she's insanely gifted in this department more than most but her really tense singing over most of her songs you get the sense that she can snap at just about any moment and sometimes she does and she writes very poetic lyrics detailing a myriad of just really nasty situations but for the most part relationships gone sour and sometimes even lays the blame on herself like the song off this album werewolf where Fiona is basically singing about how bad this person is relating them to a shark relating them to a werewolf but then admitting that she provided the bloody wound in the water or the the moon that would actually turn this person into that she teases out the terrible side of this person though characteristics like this are pretty much on every Fiona Apple album there are variations and and I would say the idler-wheel sees her using her usual tropes her usual emotions and bringing them to a new kind of unsettling and disturbing intensity and it's kind of a nice change of pace considering that her last album was really sweet by comparison to her other releases it was a lot poppier than her usual stuff it had the personality that you would expect from a Fiona album but the edge was really taken off by some really sweet and sometimes jazz nice jazzy horn sections and and some baroque strings - I would say the idler-wheel strips things back a bit it has extra instrumentation but it's used subtly for the most part it really subtracts the sugar and I think it's the better for it it's made a more emotionally potent album I'm welcome welcome Welding the sound of the instrumentation on this thing the piano the bass and the drums it's Fiona's usual foundation but it sounds so punchy and modern and crisp on this thing and the performances just sound refreshing and that they have a lot of energy they sound kind of live or at least semi live on this album Fiona's vocal delivery and her piano playing are just really fantastic in the bass and the drums kind of come in and punctuate that throughout a lot of these songs and I would say in addition to her usual instrumentation Fiona is experimenting with sound a little bit more - there's some shuffling percussion on this track there's percussion on here that that kind of tips its hat to jazz there is a track on here where there's a sample of kids yelling and there's another track where it sounds like the percussion is is made of nothing but glass bottles and tin cans the song regret actually has an ominous drone hanging in the background these subtle little sonic editions on almost every track really do separate the songs nicely and bring a different flavor to all the tracks here on the opening track I feel like Fiona is not singing as much as she is acting throughout this song she is just telling this really intense story of these internal emotional battles over these very chilly celeste ports the song daredevil is is kind of about Fiona being sort of personally addicted to emotional extremes and and the music fits it perfectly with these really punchy piano chords and lyrically she's really kind of clever and hilarious relating the situation to being a daredevil and needing a chaperone and there are these very kind of weird and and but very purposeful personality contradictions on this album like for example Fiona feels really like legitimately hurt on the song Valentine which is a song about one we're quite in love but then again she'll turn around and and sing the song left alone which is pretty much about being the kind of person you can't really love back anyway not only does Fiona tell these stories really well but they're spots on here where it just feels extremely beautiful and and sort of actually scholarly with how chill tree some of these situations with one of the hooks kind of saying there's nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key but then again Fiona can be really twisted with describing a certain situation like soaking up hot piss with white dove feathers there is actually a lot of symbolism to that image and and just the image alone outside of these symbolism is is pretty disturbing time and time again Fiona really does get her point across like nobody else overall I really don't have any huge complaints about this album I feel like the track Jonathan could have you more I guess contrast between the chorus and the verses the song hotknife at the end which i think is really kind of fun closer and has some more great lyrics i didn't really care for the multi-tracked chorus vocals on the song and just felt a little distracting i guess more than natural and as much as i would have liked to have heard Fiona kind of reinvent herself with this album I am extremely happy with what she did which is actually just kind of refine her usual sound to the point where once again it sounds fresh it sounds exciting it sounds detailed and well-written and and most of all hard-hitting production performance personality songwriting I mean for me it's all here on this album feeling a strong a tool like not on this thing it's it's really good but what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Fiona Apple the idler-wheel forever [Music] 
--YnsRamkzc,you know I called here tonight don't you why are you packing like that it's creepy stay we've gotta get the show back I've got a plan in in in in hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Joey badass 1999 Joey badass is New York rapper this is his new mixtape he's a part of a New York based rap outfit click group whatever you want to call it Pro era current car currently him in this tape are riding off the hype of two really great songs and music videos for the tracks survival tactics and hard knock really two of my my favorite hip-hop songs of this year from the production there are some original beats on here from Chuck strangers a producer that Joey badass works with quite a bit on this tape even has a few guest verses and there's beats on here too from J Dilla MF DOOM knowledge and static selected to all producers who through their beats Express a really deep love for an older hip-hop sound the beats on this tape just bow down and worship unapologetically albums like the Low End Theory Illmatic reasonable doubt mad villainy 36 chambers all the drums on this thing sound like they were lifted off of really old-school drum machines or warped old cassette tapes or just crackling dusty vinyl dirt dirty kicks snares and hi-hats coming off every single song lots of jazz samples soul and funk as well just all that stuff you remember from that boom bap era and the thing is for the most part it sounds great one of my favorite songs on here survival tactics is just this piece of hard-nosed wu-tang worship everything about this track breathes wu-tang from the piano sample to the lyrical style but the thing is the track is so friggin good and lyrically cunning it's hard for me not to love it between Joey badass and a guest on the track captain Steve's another Pro a remember there are a lot of layers of lyrical wordplay making people PE nuts like elephants but throw them in the trunk if they hate though or when Captain Steve says King Arthur when he swung his sword or King author I ain't even used a pen in like a month or four these guys actually come together again on the next track and completely kill it twice the song hard-knock comes right after it's a sadder track on this album has this very depressing descending chord progression that actually reminds me a lot of the song blue from the last roots album but with more of a vintage flavor and Joey badass and and the feature on the track CJ fly another Pro era member kind of trade stories about kind of being caught up in the downward spiral of just hood life with a lot of gritty lyrics and sincerity another few tracks on here kind of Musa where Joey's past his everyday life is at spiration songs like waves snakes and another one of my favorites daily routine which has beautifully produced B even though there are a lot of songs on here that I love there's just too many tracks that I feel are not as impressive just kind of passable the song where it's at just kind of feels really mundane where Joey is describing this kind of party situation that really isn't interesting at all and on the song righteous Minds actually on a few tracks on here Joey will spit with a pretty relentless flow and and bring some pretty dense verses but he's not really performing it with any passion or heart and really kind of sounds on exciting and women can kind of be a so-so subject for Joey to the song pennyroyal which i think was a great song righted which i think is a great song at the very first lyric of the track Joey tells you that it is a love song gone wrong that it is however other tracks like funky hoes and don't front kind of feel like paranoid assumptions about women fueled by a few bad experiences and maybe some general awkwardness with women the last track on here is an 11 minute Posse track featuring pretty much all the pro era crew members and even though it isn't one of my favorites on the album I think it's pretty much a feat that this very young up-and-coming crew actually pulled together such a long Posse track that is worth listening to all the way through overall 1999 to me is a very good tape I feel like some tracks on here definitely feel more well developed than others in terms of wordplay in terms of the hook the lyrical subject matter and the instrumental - there's just a good chunk of songs on here that only feel okay kind of like they're laying back on their boom-bap sound just kind of hoping that alone will make them sound impressive and classic without question I do love the boom bap style that Joey is going for some of my favorite records of all time have been made in it but it's not like I think it's the be-all end-all of hip-hop I think hip hop can go more places than this of course there's room for revivalism but if you're going to go down that road make sure the songs themselves are more well groomed and bring some more original production of the table that's all feeling a decent too strong 7 on this you should listen to it if you're a hip hop fan you're looking for another up-and-coming emcee looking for a new face and a few fantastic singles then get on this thing Joey badass 1999 what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next thanks for watching Anthony Fantino Joey badass 1999 [Music]
