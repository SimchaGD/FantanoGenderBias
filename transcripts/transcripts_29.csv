Q3W2rJhXMEc,oh my cinema hey guys Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd here it's time for an album review and you know this week I've just been been burning the candle of both it's been getting like no sleep ever so I'm gonna try to hurry through this do a concise review and get to bed so we're gonna review the new coma cinema LP blue suicide coma cinema is the project of Matthew Katherine a South Carolina singer-songwriter this is his third LP so to put it simply what we're talking about on blue suicide is a heap of sad sorry songs in desperate need of antidepressants and part of me would and there is a part of me that when I listen to this I kind of feel like glossing over it and sing another bedroom record but this album has too much sincerity and personality for me to completely ignore it no matter what genre of music I'm listening to that's what I'm looking for I'm looking for sincerity I'm looking for personality I'm looking for something I can get to know too often people just kind of pick up a guitar and then choose two chords and then sings you know somewhere it's about hearts and relationships and sadness if there's any kind of sadness I hey it's fake sadness it's hey let's be sad kind of sadness I can smell that crap from a mile away it smells like a Grand Central Station bathroom thankfully this record will clear that smell out of any room like a Glade plugin and even though the production on this LP can be pretty underwhelming maybe it's not all that fantastic the emotions come off strong and it's not like matt is having a freakin nervous breakdown on this record if this album is on the verge of the it's a quiet one and the lyrics kind of led onto that a little bit like on the song Hell where he says the only permanent thing about true love is the pain you feel when it's gone and the mantra on greater vultures if you're willing to eat what the vultures are not honestly Matt's words I feel are the best and most consistent thing this album has going for it because even when a song is short winded or kind of half-baked musically or structurally matt always has something dark or funny to say he's just like a little simon joiner it's so cute I love it I still kind of wish tracks like Caroline please kill me we're a little longer kind of went the distance really fleshed themselves out but I guess the silver lining to that cloud is that not much on this album is really gonna overstay its welcome and I know personality-wise I made a comparison to Simon joiner but sound wise this thing is totally totally Elliott Smith early Elliot Smith with the really understated almost whisper quiet doubled up and miked closely vocals meanwhile the guitars and the keyboards are pretty understated so are the drums there are only several tracks here that really get loud and kind of exciting and even though this thing does remain kind of you know down here in terms of volume not up here the instrumentation varies a lot on this thing with acoustic guitar bass piano organ a little bit of violin I think I heard on here tambourine drum machine a lot of reversed electric guitar leads to it's one of those records that does a lot with little and I like that some of the sounds get a little muddy sometimes some of the sounds bleed into each other but it's not like the slightly loaf I sound of this LP detracts from the music all that much the album is a little spotty though honestly because of just the variations between these tracks and in terms of length message mood instruments melodies even though Matt does prove himself to be pretty versatile and pretty resourceful on this thing there are highs and lows thankfully I felt like there were more highs I loved a lot of tracks on this thing like crystal ball vultures the title track business as usual - the album is free on Matt's website so download it pick your favorites and if you love it pick up the tape of the vinyl hmm I'm feeling a decent 7 - a light 7 I guess on this it's pretty good pretty good huh and now this is over ok go to bed cow did you turn off the relay thank you forever you 
EpoCK7SOutg,hey everybody how are you it's great to here it is this is the needle drop where we talk about rock pop electronic and experiment on the road I'm Anthony Fantana the Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for an album review actually two albums in one review two new LPS from Boris heavy rocks and attention please Boris is a Japanese trio more often than not commonly associated with drone metal doom metal sludge metal stoner rock in these two albums like I said one is heavy rocks which is also the title of an album with a similar cover that Boris released in 2002 and heavy rocks and attention please are not the only releases Boris has had this year new album also came out which shares tracks with heavy rocks and attention please different versions of those tracks I believe they also collab with MERS Bao and I'm sure I'm forgetting like 30 or 40 other releases that Boris put out this year or something and this is not the first weird release stunt these guys have pulled before in the past they've released albums then released the same album with like a different mix or a different version or various live versions of albums so because of all of this noise I guess it's really really difficult to answer the question of Anthony what Boras album should I start with it depends feedback is pretty good hopefully what Boris is doing on at least one of these two LPS is something you're looking for and I'm gonna start with the album that I preferred out of these two heavy rocks like I said these guys have already released an album same title back in 2002 and I read this v statement that came with this new version of heavy rock saying that the band is doing this renamed album because they want to do something like redefine heaviness and I felt like that would definitely happen because of the first song that dropped from this LP earlier this year reviewed it love that track riot sugar the song just opens up with this badass guitar lead and it bursts into this huge explosion of bass drums guitar leads and vocals it's kind of like the second coming of The Melvins especially with the vocals but my excitement was just ripped away from me right after that song because my least favorite track comes right after the first track and why don't I like that song why do a lot of songs on here leave me kind of wanting more well for starters that that song leaked truth does have a lot of weird off pitch falsetto vocals toward the end that I didn't care for but I feel like that track and a lot of tracks here have a lot of predictability to them when the drums stop when they start when the band starts building things back up into the main riff when a guitar solo comes in galaxians window-shopping leaked truth they're not the worst songs boris has ever written no but I kind of feel like the riffs on those tracks are either not that memorable or they've just kind of been done to death and it's not like Boris does anything to make me see them in a new light or look at them from a different angle but I am gonna say the guitar solos in those songs I'm pretty sure they're divinely inspired the doom metal God up on high came down and said there's a guitar solo awesome guitar solo here have it put it in this song thank you the fluttery playing the tone all good guitar solo good there are songs though that bring back that style of boris that i'm used to hearing and used to loving there are two 12-minute epics on this album mmm and if there are moments on here that bring back the heavy redefine the heavy its them I love the feel on both of those tracks two missing pieces starts off really dark and quiet soft and it stays melodic as it goes into these heavy distorted chords it's a serious ballad and it goes into this extremely noisy saturated thick loud climax that just sounds like the world is crumbling into dust and just casting out in various directions into space that the more straightforward tracks I do like Jackson head a lot that song is fun it seems a lot more developed than some of the other songs and it has a pretty awesome sax solo at the end and - la la feels a lot more fleshed out - and for some reason just the way the band is grooving on that song just the the nice way the drums are melding with the bass guitar and some of the bass lines and the chords the track really kind of reminds me of Russia's YYZ the only other major disappointment on this LP for me comes at the very end with the track Czechoslovakia which is hard and fast it builds up this thrash guitar riff and it gets going just ah zero to sixty at one minute and thirty seconds it just fades out abruptly like for no reason and you can imagine how pissed I was when I went online only to read that the vinyl version of this album features an extended version of that song why this album is nowhere near the time limitations of a CD did Boris decide that the rest of that song was too hardcore for CD listeners to enjoy would we have not been able to handle it on a compact disc there are moments I love moments I hate moments that are unpredictable heavy loud noisy and some spots that feel kind of generic I guess it's a little spotty for me but this LP and attention please overall I kind of see Boris moving in a more accessible direction the softer and quieter and maybe kind of sweeter side of Boris lies on attention please there's a somewhat dancey ER side to this band on here too on several tracks starting with the opener where wat to start singing over this gotta move dance beat and whatta she sings on every track of attention please and you know what I'm just not feeling attention please but it's not because of her voice that I don't like attention please it's not the vocals it's just that that predictability that kind of bothered me on on heavy rocks those those really plain and oversimplified song structures are on attention please like tenfold but it doesn't feel catchy it doesn't really feel memorable it just kind of feels pre-process for me a lot of these tracks here are shoegaze e noise pop songs with noises that aren't even that noisy but there is another side to this album a good handful of songs here feel more like an atmosphere a track here will basically wander through a series of very quiet beats very understated vocals lots of ambient sounds hanging in the background honestly how I feel is many of the tracks on attention please feel even more underdeveloped than some of the tracks on heavy rocks and I could totally see the comments coming Anthony you're just trying to pigeonhole Boris you don't like this album because it's a Boris album and you expect bars to be all doom all the time all sludge all dooms lunch and that's not true I don't have anything against a band changing directions or writing a simpler or writing catchy or songs on principle I just don't enjoy the style of this album and it's not like I'm going to be hypocritical and tell you I don't like this and then turn around and listen to a hundred other albums that sound like this and just love the hell out of them like I'm just kind of enjoying music like this but I'm only enjoying it because it's not Boris no the thing is with these two albums bored is experimenting and that's nothing new they're always experimenting they just happen to be experimenting with an idea I don't care for that much I guess but if you don't like either these albums maybe you were disappointed by them I don't feel like there's really any reason to be because Boris is going to be in a completely different place on their next four to five albums that I'm sure they'll release one or two years from now maybe the next five albums Boris names after heavy rocks will be better I already have a potential album cover so I'm kind of feeling a strong six to a light seven on heavy rocks I thought it was good I liked it but I'm really not gonna rush back into revisiting the whole album any time soon but those two those do development at tracks and as far as the tension please goes and kind of feeling like a light for didn't like it but I can see other people getting into it it does have a somewhat consistent style it's just not something I'm really looking for what do you think of these two albums do you like them do you hate him why and what should I review next anthony Fantana boris attention please and heavy rocks 
NXcbNP9i2jw,one of them wrong wrong wrong you'll be out of the calzone if you do this okay hurry hi everybody Anthony fan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd I've got a cold I don't want you to catch it it's a virus it's pretty mad didn't you write a script for this a script yeah you're yes yes I do ah Thank You Anthony to chest I have it right here in front of me is a very special script for this a review here that I'm going to be doing is it music nerd Lady Gaga's or peps I can't do this this is bad this feel Sora Cal get back in the calzone [Music] can I have my glasses back oh thanks that's how we're going to do it we're mature now we're being mature hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd about to do an album review of the new Lady Gaga LP Born This Way I would hope by now that everyone in anyone knows who Lady Gaga is at least a little bit pop star diva singer and the person behind some of 2009's best dance pop singles like bad romance telephone speechless dance in the dark that telephone hook is good whether you love the fame monster or you hate it the songs on that thing are produced well and overall it's really concise release very lean and even though Gaga sort of soaks herself in this persona this image her music at the time of Fame Monster stuck to those basics of what makes popular music so enjoyable plus it was nice to hear a diva of Gaga's popularity to embrace influences like Queen soft-sell The Beatles and Madonna now I could seriously seriously review Born This Way I mean I thought about it I listened to it a bunch of times I decided how I felt about every single track and maybe I could talk about how all of Gaga's flash and image has basically slit its wrists and then it bled into the music completely drowning any chance of this being somewhat interesting and I could also talk about how Gaga's music has pretty much always been aimed at people who want to get sloppy drunk and then get out there on the dance floor and that's fine it's just that her previous efforts definitely fame monster the songs on those albums were so nice that you can enjoy them out of the context of the club the bar scene and I could talk about with all the crummy electro sounds on this LP there's no possible way that this LP is men anything else but the club or some really high volume car karaoke we could talk about all of that we could but instead let's just look at this cover [Music] why why did the south of kirkuk we throw off you can't judge me I was born this way [Music] 
orxEQ343cVo,al-madiq hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd let's just get straight into this because we have a long long review here LSI is a Detroit MC who's best known for his stuff in slum village which is a Detroit rap outfit that J Dilla used to produce for back when he was still among us and Elza has a couple of good Bhushan solo releases but this new mixtape that he has put out is by far his ballsiest project ever so ballsy that I dismissed it a little bit pretty much right out of the gate the title is al-madiq and it's basically a beat for beat reinterpretation of one of hip-hop's most notable records dropped by a 20 year old in 1994 nas's Illmatic around that time the West Coast in hip hop was getting a lot of attention thanks to NWA Ice Cube dr. Dre Snoop Dogg for popularizing a grittier style of rap about violence and drugs some of it from the standpoint of the observer some of it from the standpoint of the aggressor but artists like Mobb Deep wu-tang Black Moon Biggie and nas with Illmatic were keeping New York relevant as rap got harder not only is nas's flow fantastic on that record and very well seasoned considering his age but his rhymes his storytelling his metaphors all of it gave the gritty New York Street Life a very accurate and grim picture I mean nas's prowess as an MC made that LP great and not only that but the beats on that album made that LP pretty failsafe too with contributions from q-tip DJ premier Pete Rock large professor all of them kept funk and jazz samples behind the boom bap maintaining a style that to me is one of hip-hop's best and still thrives today so in terms of legacy and ability Elle's eye has some pretty big shoes to fill on elm attic how could he dare rap on any beat over this album much less step to the entire LP and rap over every beat it's not like this hasn't happened before it's 2011 it's the internet age I'm positively absolutely sure there are mixtapes out there where MCS have snagged beats from Hill Matic thrown it on their mixtape rapper from Fresno that I reviewed on this channel before fest Shawn is actually put out a mixtape in tribute to Illmatic where he raps over every beat plus a lot of rappers like to mention Illmatic as an influence and I'm sure it's authentic on some level but I feel like sometimes it's just because they want to earn some cred or something because of all of this I was kind of poisoned against El mattock from the get-go I just kind of thought well you know it's it's never going to be as good as the original so why take the time to listen to it to understand it to interpret it what's the point so i sat with Illmatic and listened through to the beats listen through the rhymes and the stories and I have to say honestly in my opinion I feel like this album is one of the greatest recontextualization 's hip-hop has brought in a long time seriously eles i went all out on this project first with the inclusion of the will sessions band the beats the melodies from Illmatic are here but they've been revamped and revitalized by a live band so the sounds hit harder the songs feel more lively and this leads to Elle's eye and we'll sessions taking some really really nice liberties with this album improvising spots on certain tracks changing up hooks they change up the intro on Genesis louder horns and organs on halftime resyncing the hook on the world is yours and a lot of jazzy piano improv on the end that song is they string it out instrumentally the gorgeously arranged strings at the end of one love the nice string work that introduces represent some of the R&B singing that I think ends the song life's a bitch that there's not one single change or alteration or difference between Illmatic and L Matic that makes me roll my eyes from a sonic standpoint there's nothing here that would make me rather listen to the original mmm we kind of had that conversation on yesterday's review the track review for Rome I don't have a problem with artists wearing their influences on their sleeves or even tributing their influences but if you're going to do that be ready to improve upon what influences you or at least put a unique spin on it so that you don't live in the shadow of the original see what I'm saying see Illmatic as like the Blues the Blues in the days of Robert Johnson was a foundation a structure an idea concept that musicians would use to make a song tell a story convey an idea I don't see elm attic as lsi saying hey look at me I'm covering Illmatic look at me to me this mixtape is l's I using ill maddox beats song subjects and nas's rhyme schemes to tell his own personal story like New York state of minds really hard Street lyricism gets updated and relocated on the track Detroit state of mind memory lane is where else I raps about looking back at a younger version of himself getting kicked out of class seeing his mother get sick from what I imagine was cancer meeting the guys who he would eventually be in slum village with going to rap battle seeing Eminem rap battle I think his most interesting revamp comes on the song one love where it's kind of a painful song but also very romantic and inspirational song to two lovers just kind of trading great conversation and troubled pasts this album leaves with some words of wisdom from ELLs I talking about warning rappers up-and-coming artists about record deals managers contracts and there's even a phoned-in endorsement from Pete Rock telling ELLs I that this project is great that he needs to move on and do more and that he's one of the best MCS out there it took some hard listening a little effort and some understanding but now I see illmatic and L Matic as two completely different animals and I only see it that way because of how well the beets were revitalized by will sessions and also by how much personality and personal story Elle's eye laces into the original scheme of this album but the question is still there is it better is it on par with Illmatic and I don't feel like I could I can't answer that question personally to me I get the same enjoyment from Illmatic that I do from this I just hear heartbeats great stories memorable lines like the hood is a glass house the devil throws stones through like illmatic I can really sink my teeth into this record and get a little more out of it as I chew it over again and again and again and that to me makes it a success so I'm feeling honestly a decent too strong eight on this thing it's surprising even to me that I would enjoy a project of this nature but I am it's it's done really really well surprisingly so so damn it's a free mixtape download it link below listen to it for yourself make your own decision and leave me a comment tell me what you think do you love this thing do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana el mattock forever [Music] [Music] 
UWcxXnus0zY,it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's track reviews right now where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent purse waah major label this time around okay we're going to talk up a collaboration between Danger Mouse and Daniele Luppi Rome this thing is basically a tag team effort between a producer who I don't think I need to tell you how prolific and involved he is in various projects and in Italian composer and the reason this came to be is because they both have a severe crush on Italian spaghetti western soundtracks it's kind of a sincere look back at the work of Ennio Morricone or Bruno Nicolai basically composers who made cinema in the 60s exciting not only that but Jack White and Norah Jones have been featured on a lot of tracks of this LP Jack white is on the one that we're going to listen to now linked below this video the rows with the broken neck from what I've read this album was five years in the making and I don't see it the effort definitely does show up in the sound of this LP in the dedication to vintage recording style vintage instruments and just the aesthetic I mean in terms of sonic qualities this music has been recreated almost flawlessly which is why my favorite moments on this album are the instrumental tracks which take me back to another time like when I was a kid watching TMZ or AMC you know those old classic movie on television but it's cool to hear that stuff done with a crystal-clear sound from 2011 I'm just kind of left asking where's the passion and excitement and melancholy that this kind of music is supposed to soundtrack I feel like this is all of the motions without any of the emotions in terms of music and Composition this thing really just lost me the generically strummed acoustic guitar the very sagging bass line that feels like it's afraid to emphasize any semblance of rhythm the very plainly placed who's coming from the chorus in the background the xeroxed and repetitive vocal melody and the fake sadness this song is drenched in is too orchestrated to feel real or impassioned plus I really really wonder is his Jack White's voice though I love his voice and I love his previous work is his voice the best vehicle for this style I mean really Jack White Norah Jones Italian style soundtrack music circa 1966 what but that's the thing about this LP though it is in love with this style of composition it's not that style of composition it's that sound dulled down made a little friendlier made a little more accessible for a new young western audience because I honestly couldn't see how how you could find this album exciting unless you're not familiar with this kind of music or if you haven't seen any old westerns this track and most of the album really are not doing it for me and normally I like revitalizations but when you do something like that you run the risk of creating a situation where the listener just wants to rip the CD out of the stereo and just go listen to the original and sadly that happened to me here I'd rather listen to a soundtrack from Ennio Morricone or Nino Rota or Bruno coleye I mean I guess it's worth a visit if you're a huge fan of any of the parties involved but if you're a soundtrack nut I don't see how taking the formula making it poppier making it more accessible and then throwing Jack White and Norah Jones on top of it is going to make you want to hear this more than once I'm feeling a decent two strong three on this thing I'm just totally this is not my thing and this is the album of the year for some people but I'm just moving in a completely different direction from this but what do you guys think especially the people who wanted me to review this what attracts you to this album do you love it why do you love it and if you hate it why do you hate it and what should I review next anthony Fantana roam forever 
2auhQqV9-Rs,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd telling you that on the needle drop calm right now there are three audio track reviews some people told me that they were having trouble listening to them because the button for them was not working this time I actually added links so that you could direct download them on the website if the player is not working for you so you could just download those you don't necessarily have to stream them on the website and they are reviews of cats McCombs County line loved that track Africa high tech skank slap like that track a lot and the childish gambino song freaks and geeks attend like sorry these reviews are a little late the Internet's busiest music nerd I just talked about myself in the third person I don't do that often don't I Cal no no I do not no no I don't anyway I've been especially busy this past weekend working out a lot of technical things relating to video kind of getting a headache but I think it'll be worth it in the end I hope but anyway those three reviews linked down below alright let me know what you think should be some more reviews coming up very soon forever you 
YkqCnZIaf_4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and from what I can imagine we're all still here no rapture that's cool that's fine we're all still here the last night I had a little bit of a personal celebration doing what I would imagine I need to do before you know the world ended or something like that and that was to go out and see the movie hobo with a shotgun trailer is a link below in this video I'm going to recommend five debut albums that's it any reason a lot of people asked me to review classic stuff or my favorite stuff and it's mostly because I imagine people want suggestions so I'm going to suggest five debut albums now debuts can be kinda tricky a lot of artists may come out with a debut and it'll be the greatest thing they've ever done and every album after that we'll just you know shrink in comparison and and everything they put out will be compared to that first album oh you know it's not as good as that or you know it's not as good as that and also debuts can be a very formative area for a Bands career where people sort of let the debut slip through the cracks eventually because there's so much more impressed by the later output so these debuts fall on both sides of that spectrum and they start with black moon and to the stage if you're into hardcore New York hip hop with a boom bap sound from the early 90s not too much unlike Smith & Wesson wu-tang Tribe Called Quest organized confusion please get your ears on this thing okay next Dead Kennedys fresh fruit for rotting vegetables California punk band one of my favorites this is first LP it's not my favorite of there's actually like how they got clearer and a little more aggressive on their later stuff but still great songs on that thing especially stealing people's mail you want to hear a song called stealing people's mail don't you listen to that next Square pushers feed me weird things while this isn't my favorite Square pusher record I think he did end up doing interesting more interesting things later it is a nice raw fusion of jazz fusion and IDM drum and bass I love the grooves on this album I love the soloing as well it's a really fun listen for me especially since I like jazz music this next album also has a lot of jazz roots in it the Mahavishnu Orchestra is inter mounting flame definitely my favorite jazz fusion record John McLaughlin guitar playing on this album is fantastic the stuff that came after this album isn't too bad but still this is on a whole nother level for me and finally overs first LP forget I'm not gonna pronounce the whole thing I have no clue but black metal my friends if you're looking for something atmospheric yet intense and filled with nice funky interludes very creative and very interesting that and I know I haven't reviewed the new over album yet I'm sorry but still if you've never heard of over looking for a nice little Inn for black metal this is definitely a spot five debuts just throwing them out there if you haven't heard of any of those debut albums whether you believe you're into the genre that they belong in or not screw that screw genre screw what you already think you like try them out okay links below okay stay cool forever [Music] [Music] 
Pj9pEejYtFc,oh hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd hahaha time for a review ha ha ha Balkans ha ha ha self-titled kal couch esta what do you think of Balkans and then never there's no talking in the rat calzone there's nothing in the wag calzone don't type that don't type oh you're doing it right now are you now that my mood is ruined Balkans is an Atlanta rock band and this is their self-titled debut and how to explain this basically this thing is kind of like punks at prom they're in tuxedos their Mohawks are shaved off they're misfits tattoos are covered with sleeves but there's still an edge there their shoes are clean but it's a spit shine they're spiking the punch they're hitting on other dudes girlfriends they're moshing on the dance floor and they're throwing on the dance first LP on the DJ's turntable when he's not looking so to go with that softer side Balkans do-right very straightforward and concise pop rock songs they really stick to a structure and throw a lot of melodic guitar leads in there but there's a ton of energy and passion behind it maybe a little bit of anger as well and because of that it kind of feels like they're trying to bust out of this structure or make this old tame formula feel young and wild and alive again I love the production on this record it's really really tight just very I got a saline the drums are very snappy they've got a lot of attack on them little to no release just like on some of my favorite Punk records and the guitars are played really roughly fast too but no matter how much energy the guitars have behind them they never lose their sense of melody of harmony there's a lot of jangle to those guitars like on early strokes records but that's not the only parallel this band has with The Strokes but we'll get to that later the bass lines do a great job of differentiating themselves from the guitars when they're not both in that you know unison down stroking motion and they find really in resting ways to emphasize the rhythm in these songs and really propel them forward which is what bass does best and the last thing I want to touch down upon sound-wise style-wise are he vocals this dude the way he sings it really helps me separate this band from other bands it's not the most distinct voice on the block but he goes all out whether it's on a faster track like let you have it where he's just freaking out aggressively or the slower songs or I really kind of feel like he's over a moding as much as he possibly can he's just disemboweling himself and letting his guts spill out everywhere he doesn't care where they go just as long as they're spilling their splash it's like a Gallagher performance now honestly in my opinion there is not a bad song on here it's a very solid debut from a solid band but is every song here amazing me it does drown in its influences of a tiny bit this album in terms of songwriting just reeks of a deep appreciation for The Strokes the guitar lead on dressed in black the vocals on Black Swan and their flickers of that influence popping up on other spots of this album it's almost to the point where I feel like these guys could have ghost written for The Strokes on angles and nobody would have known the difference but you know what if you're going to show off an influence and everybody does no matter what they think why not show off a good one because for me those first two strokes records if you're looking for modern immediate rock songwriting they're two of the best but still what these guys do on their own impresses me a lot they write a lot of transitions in their songs from one part to another the choruses just burst with intensity they make sure that the verses bring a lot of contrast into the songs solo parts interludes bridges it's all really well structured and yet it's so energetic and fun you wouldn't necessarily need to pick apart what they're doing musically to really get anything out of it I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this LP you've liking it a lot liking it a lot and I definitely recommend it I feel like it can only go up from here excited for what these guys put out in the future good debut what do you guys think of this LP you can listen to it down there in the D box there's a link for your ears and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana balkans forever 
6Igq-xjJ31A,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for a review so let's have a little back-and-forth on this new this will destroy ULP tunnel blanket these guys are a Texas instrumental rock band and back in 2008 when they dropped their self-titled LP there were just another one of those sparkling guitar bands with slow building crescendos and musical passages and even though these guys are a different band they write songs differently they did get a lot of understandable comparisons to explosions in the sky or God is an astronaut but these dudes even though they've been categorized as rock band have always had kind of a soft spot for ambient music for drone for noise that's been displayed on some traction their self-titled debut that single EP that they dropped in 2010 and also on tunnel blanket that triumphant crescendo style of post rock that we're used to hearing is not on this record it's been swapped out for something much darker and noisier and gargantuan and in a way it reminds me a lot of those loud droning dissonant interludes from my favorite god speed records or even songs from swans soundtracks for the blind and also one of my favorite Mogwai tracks like her odd tunnel blanket packs one full hour of material into eight tracks and they all flowed together pretty cohesively and I was really gripped by this LP at the start with the with the opener little smoke and I'm not sure I could have asked for a better opener on this record after about three minutes of very subtle and somber chords it just explodes and into the end of the world with all these guitars just grinding against my ears until I've given up all hope for and kind and the crescendo here there is no crescendo son its drone get wrapped up in the atmosphere get wrapped up in the rumble I love that it's just 12 minutes of this nice blissful vast intensity that seems endless the next track is a lot like that but goes much easier on the ears it's kind of like the calm after the storm I love the cycling sounds at the end of this track and the thing is for these first two tracks the entire album really with the exception of pretty much nothing I love the textures I love the sounds very high-quality sounds from beginning to end I could just listen to these sounds just drone forever and I would be pretty entertained it remind me a lot of the textures that I heard off that new Tim Hecker record actually but the middle of the cell P is where things get a little hairy for me communal blood starts off really well the swells are very subtle and the chords just strike this painful spot in me it sounds like a beautiful orchestration from a neo Morricone pronunciation and the thing is with the way the drums are mixed on this song the crash cymbals the bass drum pretty much engulfed the entire song just swallow the mix and make it difficult for me to really enjoy anything else but my least favorite track here is killed the Lord left for the new world which sits right in the middle of this album and maybe I don't like it that much because it goes back to that more triumphant that more rock-oriented sound and but the way the snares are marching with the way the chords are moving it all just feels so predictable to me with where it's going and because of that I don't really feel like I want to be on for the ride I don't really get blown away by tunnel blanket again until black dunes but the thing about that track is that it goes for a similar very quiet intro and then explosion at a few minutes in left hook that the first track does and though the textures are different dunes is a little harsher than that first track it just feels like I've run this course before I'm kind of feeling a strong six to a light seven on this record it was pretty good and surprisingly the more rock-oriented moments on here I didn't end up enjoying that much I really loved the drone moments I really loved the more ambient moments it's it's it's ultimately I asked myself I love that this sounds like things that I love but is this what I love I mean if you really value loud deep and interesting sounds then you know at least at least visit this do not take my lukewarm attitude as you know avoid this no I think you should try this I think you should try this all right what do you think about this record you loving it you hating it why and what do you think I should do next Anthony Fantana this will destroy you forever 
WIyRRLBsukw,the UV rays Oh moe hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd thank you for watching yesterday there was a mess-up in the video with the editing thank him still in the wack calzone never getting out but still we have to do an album review we're gonna talk about the new UV race album homo this is the second LP from this Australian six-piece who sounds like their favorite album of all time as the Velvet Underground's white light/white heat this thing was even recorded with a member of the band eddy current suppression ring another Australian band a garage punk band who has quite have been in common with these guys and working with a member of eddy current on this thing has led to some good production the guitars are really brittle and sharp and crunchy the basses warm drums really boom and snap the vocals are in a really nice audible pocket in the mix and this thing when I cranked it it blares I can confidently say if you're looking for what might possibly be the filthiest grimy astrak-- record this year then bring it on most of what's here are three to five minute noisy cacophonous garage rock jams that are so rough it's kind of like shaving with a rusty old disposable razor most of these tracks will just start with a groove and then will eventually grow into this runaway train of everybody being is loud or as messy as possible kind of like a song from the fall or the Stooges and all the instrumentation just enhances the noisy aesthetic just two guitars on this thing bass drums melodica male and female vocals and a saxophone pops up here and there too and everybody playing so loosely just enhances that tension people are losing track of tempo people come in late for their part in the song there there are flub notes and drum hits that are off but you know that's what life is life is not a constant tempo and a flashy song structure if it is for you congratulations but for most of us it's just raw and in the moment this thing is basically like sex without a condom on a one-night stand and I know you're thinking initial reaction Oh STDs Oh pregnancy and the thing is this LP lives in that blissful moment before any repercussions hit this album is not really worried about what's going to happen the next morning thankfully music cannot get you pregnant or can it I'm kidding I'm kidding it's a pillow it's a pillow comedy there's some funny song subjects here like on Burton that cat which is literally about a bad dream where a cop fingers the narrator fingers him the song inner north makes fun of artsy types who run around all day wanting attention and drinking soy lattes and homo the title track of this LP is actually about how we're all Homo sapiens we're all human it's an album that connects us on a very biological level I do have a few issues though some tracks here in comparison to others feel kind of short winded like they're just kind of filler slo-mo feels that way for me while others feel kind of long-winded because there's only so many times these guys can jam out a groove and jam out a riff jam out a bar of music before I'm just like okay I get the point I understand what you're trying to tell me but you've done it you've told me I've been told but most of the time when I'm listening to this I just imagine a an old smokey club where this band is playing on stage and there's all these punks on the floor just like bopping and just like going crazy to the music primal urges so I'm kind of feeling the light eight on this loved it quite a bit not my favorite thing this year but definitely definitely a highlight I like the vocals I like those crunchy guitars and I like the attitude what do you think of this LP do you love it do you hate it and why and what do you think I should review next thank you for watching Anthony Fantana the UV race homo forever 
pbpDut3adjE,it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd getting ready to do a track review where we talk about the latest and greatest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion thank you for watching we are going to talk about a track from an album coming out this summer the new bone Iver LP on jag Jaguar liver I love that guy well what can I say I love the guy too especially his fourth album Oh totally it's it it's a greener you water your some such a liar I hate you so much get in the wack calzone get get in the wack calzone you are Cal you have been wack that is why we have the wack calzone tournament anyway this new bone Iver LP bone Iver is Justin Vernon and if you know this guy most likely it's from his first LP for Emma Forever Ago which got a ton of critical acclaim when it dropped and for good reason there's a lot of very mellow acoustic music out there but Justin's in particular I find very haunting and affecting there's something very authentic about the sadness on that album that just hits me even when I'm not really reading into the lyrics we did have blood bank come out in 2009 but since the release of forever ago Justin's pretty much been writing the collaboration train with volcano choir and gangs he was even on Kanye's last LP and he slated to be on the new little way now but when it drops June 21st is when boney Vera's supposed to come out with boney there there is a June 21st is when Bon Iver is supposed to come out with Bon Iver one track has leaked from its so far linked below this video on YouTube it's also linked on the needle drop comm Calgary oh where my headphones there we go okay I have the feeling that a lot of people are going to be on the fence with this track because it is kind of a change especially considering the intro with the very icy synthesizers and the atmospheric vocals and the drums that come in after the introduction it doesn't really sound like that acoustic singer/songwriter folk ish sound that justin is usually toying with it's kind of a new-agey sound but the thing is for me the mood hasn't really changed the mood is still here what I liked so much about that debut LP is still here that very sobering sadness because there are a lot of things to love here like the mood the build but I guess what I liked the most about this track is the vocal melody justin has a really excellent sense of melody and he always puts together something that strikes me as catchy or affecting the first time around first listened but it also feels kind of familiar and yet I can't place it but I do have a few issues as the song builds the guitars and the keyboards that are kind of bouncing back and forth in the left and right channels they're not arranged very well or in a very interesting way there just seemed kind of aimless though it's nice to have those textures there they don't really add anything melodically to this song my biggest issue with Calgary comes around the 230 mark when the song has this final orgasm in my opinion the ambition of this track is way too big for the loaf is recording quality here because when the track finally explodes it doesn't really feel like I'm getting a push I'm not getting a lift I just hear mush just this brittle guitar mush and you know it's not the worst thing a low fire recording has ever done to a song the song is still pretty readable as it gets really loud and and distorted in intimate self recorded affair can have its advantages too because this song for all of its flaws to me did sound very earnest very in the moment very raw and very sincere so I'm kind of taking the good with the bad on this one I'm liking it a lot but I'm not in love with it I'm feeling like a decent too strong seven on this thing and maybe it'll just impact me more feel a harder punch when the rest of the songs are wrapped around this track and what do you think about this song do you love it do you hate it why and are you excited for this new bony bear album hmm Anthony Fantana bony bear Calgary forever you 
O-6hnRcicVc,Peyman tobin yes Sam whoo hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd going to do an album review of something that I'm pretty excited to talk about the new amon tobin album assam hope i'm pronouncing his name correct this guy is a Brazilian music producer whose discography spans all the way back to the mid 90s and helped to define drum and bass with his early work like Greco Lodge and permutation but that is just tough I am finding out in in my research I am just getting into his music now in preparation for this review I am NOT an Amon Tobin expert and now that I go back and listen to that early Tobin stuff it's kind of refreshing because it's not like his music was a mixture of electronics and jazz fusion like Square pusher was doing he was going directly to jazz to find samples and break beats that he put a lot of original electronics over some interesting stuff but as I climbed further of this dudes discography it became clearer to me that I think Islam is going to go down as a bit of a black sheep in the Tobin canon this guy's last couple of releases have been kind of dark and Atmospheric but I think even this is so far out there that it might sucker punch longtime fans Plus this thing is so experimental it would be difficult for people who are new to Tobin to jump on the bandwagon at this point there are some moments on this LP where the sounds and the textures remind me of this guy's earlier work like do or golfer versus boxer from Supermodified Rosie's from Alpha Mount where or even big furry hat from Foley's room but the the drum and bass influences that Tobin usually brings to the table on his releases just wave goodbye to them because tempo melody structure straightforwardness and maybe even accessibility all of those are suffocated at the hand of sound just experimenting tinkering and crafting sounds not crafting songs but crafting sculpting envisioning sounds I'm just so impressed by the variety and also the quality of the textures on this album because this thing did bend my mind a little bit and this thing is freaking dense to take the first track journeyman since this album has been streaming online I've listened to that song over and over and over and over and I don't think I've picked up every sonic detail of it yet and it's so difficult to describe all of the sounds that I'm hearing I rack my brain and I really don't think I could do the songs justice by talking I'm hearing planks and clunks and clinks hums and clicks and little shots of distortion slurps and and booms and these thick low-end bass hits that sound like they they've come straight out of a dubstep song they kind of sound like a wool that doesn't whoop it just kind of stops it and sometimes these tracks just fall in and out of tempo too and I like that to me tempo is good but it can be a little boring sometimes always hearing things that always have tempo I like it when an artist can let go of tempo for a little bit wander into a heavy interlude sort of get rid of those training wheels and get rid of the safety net and really see what happens the biggest records I've ever heard have been like post-rock records do metal records drone metal records the kind of music that uses atmosphere and volume to portray sighs a mountainous size and not every track here tries to sound big but the ones that do sound big like earth crashing into the Sun big but ultimately my major gripe and my only real issue with this album is inconsistency but it's kind of an intentional inconsistency because this album morphs from one mood to another around its halfway point basically all these dense heavy weird abstract instrumentals fade into this plink 'ti Plunkett II children's esque tune where I kind of envisioned Hello Kitty figurines dancing in circles together and it does have some eeriness to it but it really isn't what I prefer I liked the darker weirder sounds on the first half of this album and they are still kind of there on the last third of this LP just rumbling and hissing away in the background but the mood is definitely changed in a way that I don't like all that much it hasn't gone completely friendly completely cutesy but candy candy cat and a lot of the melodies and textures kind of stayed cuter and friendlier after kitty cat comes on and not that those tracks are bad I just think that the last third of this album and the first two thirds kind of represent these two completely different sounds that really don't complement each other all that well but despite me not being into the latter part of this LP I still think Tobin has pulled together some of the most interesting sounds of his career and put them on his own I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this LP it's really really good I'm not in love with it as a whole but they're definitely some of my favorite tracks of 2011 on that first part of this album but what do you think do you love this thing do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantana amon tobin is some forever you 
nyHhmEHt5qo,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and I'm sorry in my last video um I did that and it freaked some people out but we need to forgive and forget and learn and grow and live past our trespasses and just watch album reviews you know just check just just check out some album reviews and I have one right here luckily of the new Jesu LP ascension Jesu is a band masterminded by UK guitarist Justin K Broderick and since the eighties this dude has amassed a discography that is pretty eclectic Jesu is what justin has been concentrating on since the disband of God flesh and after the influence that dark doom and industrial metal sound that God flesh used to have lost its grip of jisoo's early stuff this project became something really kind of blissful uplifting while most bands try to be really menacing with this style of sound Jesu comes off in many of its tracks really serene I thought at first oh man this is gonna be an easy in this is a slam-dunk sadly this thing was not loved it first listen or second listen or fifth listened or any listen after that I kind of feel like this thing lives in the shadow of everything Jesu has done before and the songs tunes chord progressions melodies aren't the most fantastic that have ever been crafted under the Gesu name but the thing is Jesu isn't just about songwriting Jesu is also heavy jesse was also loaded with different sounds and textures but even that's not doing that much for me I mean seriously that the recording of this LP really baffles me this thing is definitely not the most booming or resonant that Jesu has ever sounded the guitars here are slightly better by the guitars on opiate Sun and things get even heavier on that early stuff I kind of feel like I'm getting nitpicky but then again I another thing that bothers me about this thing is just the drum mix from ascension where's the kick I hear little to no kick and while we're on the drums they're really my least favorite part of this album because they feel much lazier here than they have on past releases barely holding on to the same tempo that the guitars are I feel like there's really no interplay to this and it sounds like Justin recorded all of these instruments himself and that's happened before on geser releases but this is one of the first moments I've come across where everything kind of fails to connect there's like no interplay there's no cohesion nothing is touching it just makes everything feel so flat and and kind of dull on this LP especially when the songs here attempt to climax or build toward the end like December or black lies it just kind of feels like I'm celebrating the 4th of July with only sparklers plus sometimes the vocals come off really muddy and unintelligible where they might have been a little clearer on earlier stuff overall it it sounds like Jesu and it acts like Jesu and it talks like Jesu and it walks like Jesu and it looks like Jesu but something's kind of off and that's like driven me insane listening to this thing over and over and trying to figure out why I'm I'm not enjoying it all that much I had to go back and listen to the old stuff to make sure I hadn't turned into a Jesu hater overnight or something this is just my opinion but this LP just isn't that memorable for me I don't think it'sit's that fantastic of a of a release for Jesu but this thing is still a jesu album and it has a lot of the qualities that I like hearing in this style of music but I'm not loving it and I'm not hating it I'm really just on the fence with it so I I gotta say I'm feeling a light 5 on this hmm not happy about feeling that way about a jesu album but what do you think are you liking this more than me are you hating it and why and what do you think I should review next but uh Jesu Ascension the needle drop thank you for watching forever 
HzUdHq42Z6A,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd wearing the same exact thing I was last week when I told you in a similar post that I have three audio reviews up at the needle drop dot-com right now the new fucked up single the new man man album and also the new Matthew David album linked below hohoho forever [Music] you 
hgryNZz-34Q,Manchester Orchestra hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd red sweater Manchester Orchestra simple math flex your head jar of water it's time for an album review Manchester Orchestra is a jaja band and this is their latest LP simple math and these guys play a style of rock music I could only really call indie rock not necessarily because these guys are difficult to pin down but they so willingly pin themselves within that style of music and I know indie rock is a really broad term but Manchester Orchestra kind of makes me nostalgic for a time when I used to listen to Death Cab for Cutie and bright eyes and dismemberment plan and a little bit of Built to Spill a little bit of Wilco Grandaddy Modest Mouse you know a time when listening to underground music got you called emo instead of hipster like today now even though indie is a broad term all of those bands I mentioned are a good representation of the style of music these guys try to recreate the band's last album was a little bit cleaner a little more produced than the previous one I'm like a virgin losing a child but Manchester Orchestra still maintained their passion and energy as a rock band a simple math is where I'm starting to wonder if they really have that anymore maybe indie rock just isn't what it used to be or just this style of it I kind of feel like it's wrinkles are showing their flashes here of Manchester orchestras past like on the track Pensacola which comes together like a really strong catchy power pop tune a lot of downstroke guitars fun group choruses great lyrics and melodies and a really triumphant horn part at the end but a lot of these tracks here suffer from I don't know a lack of modesty maybe a little bit too much ambition or something I guess I like my the rock to be a little bit more earnest or down-to-earth so many songs here are just slathered in strings and booming guitars and this false sense of drama there are some spots some spots here where I do connect a lot of passion with the building instrumentation like on the end of the title track here which doesn't really drown itself out in these extra louder sounds the song kind of progresses into those sounds and once it gets to those sounds the climax is pretty moving but I'm left kind of underwhelmed by most of what's going on here mighty April Fool virgin pale black eye those tracks to me are too wrapped up in either how loud they are how stylistically different they are from the album because I hear some like 90s alternative rock riffs in there or they're wrapped up in there extra instrumentation to the point where I'm just not really hearing an interesting song or an interesting style just kind of this relative relative heaviness at this point in their career I just kind of feel like Manchester Orchestra is merely working with indie rocks most accessible aspects and then layering strings and horns over it they've basically taken everything out of indie rock that was so groundbreaking in the first place which kind of makes it a very unmemorable record for me there are some decent Tunes here and there but I do not see myself returning to this like ever I'm kind of feeling a strong four to a light five on this album I could see why it's getting popular I could see why people are digging it but it's it's not for me but what do you think of this thing love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Manchester Orchestra forever you 
on1vkPNRFwg,[Music] [Applause] hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd excited to bring you another album review if I if I wasn't I I guess I wouldn't make so many this is the new liturgy album Aesthetica I've been following this band since their 2009 LP re inhalation an equally odd album title and that LP was definitely a standout for me of that year even though it didn't make my favorites list some tracks blew me away while others underwhelmed me the recording could have been a little bit better too but what stuck out the most to me in that band and what really made these guys memorable is just the intense drumming the drummer in this band is something else he really had me at first listen and there's a lot of evolution in the way that he plays - it's just not this one flat constant blast beat that goes on forever there's tons of detail just snare rolls that syncopate with the guitar riffs hard hard kick patterns flurries of cymbals and the way the heat plays the way this whole band plays is really cohesive I loved how this group really played together I just get this sense that every member of the band is following so closely to what every other member of the band is doing and I don't really get that in a lot of music especially in modern metal music where I hear a lot of trigger drums where I hear a lot of guitar riffs that sound like they're snapped to a tempo as opposed to what the other members in the band are doing usually I've got to put on a jazz record to hear the kind of musician to musician intimacy that liturgy has and at the end of the day it might be the best thing that they have going for them these guys are a black metal band if you're not into black metal then I don't make any promises that this will turn you on to the genre and even if you are a fan of black metal you may still hate these guys a lot of people have been calling this band hipster black metal and I never really looked into it I never really took those labels seriously a lot of American black metal groups are labeled hipster black metal I just didn't see liturgy being labeled that is any different but when I finally got the promo for this LP in the mail listened to it revisited it decided to do this review I finally came across the source of all this controversy the interviews with the frontman of this band hunter hunt Hendrix and also his little manifesto transcendental black metal which is allegedly the genre of music this band plays I'm not going to go into what transcendental black metal is here or what I think about it I wrote a lengthy piece reacting to that on the needle drop calm it's linked below this video on YouTube before I knew about any of this transcendental stuff I kind of saw Aesthetica as kind of a combination of black metal and math rock liturgy does have a lot of the same elements that traditional black metal does some of the really intense drumming blastbeats retched vocals harsh walls of guitar chords tremolo picking but they throw in a lot of variations that keep me coming back to these songs again and again and again and again the reason I cite math rock is a lot of these really tight dizzying syncopated rifts like a track will be going and then it'll just have a short stop and then go into this one it'll stop again and then it'll go right back into lane into the chord that sound kind of has this really weird rollercoaster effect where I'm going up and down really fast one of my personal reasons for loving black metal is how harsh and disorienting it can be and I kind of feel like all this tight syncopation these stops and starts add to that aspect of this style of music the musicianship here is absolutely fantastic these guys sound like they've been playing together for decades even though I know that's not the case the the way these guys speed up together on high gold is fantastic those sharp swells on the track true will in between the verses are great and the way everything just builds at the end of returner Oh pure ecstasy to put it in a very lonely island kind of way I'd moved in my pants a lot of black metal bands over the course of time have used reverb to create a similar effect a similar crescendo or swell and what I like about liturgy is that yeah they have a little bit of reverb on the vocals but they don't use reverb to sound big when they sound big it's because they're playing harder they are swelling and shrinking as a band and that's resulted in something that to me sounds a very kind of real very tangible but not to say the production isn't important this thing was produced very well by Colin Marston of Krauss and behold the octopus it's a really heavy sound the drums hit hard the guitars wring out beautifully another thing I dig about this LP is the variation between these tracks like generation and veins of gold to instrumental tracks where the band basically lays on the same riff for seven to eight minutes and I know I know that doesn't sound fun I know it's a weird comparison but I enjoy hearing liturgy lay on those riffs in the same way that I enjoy hearing lightning-bolt do the same thing on their stuff but the song glass earth does really kind of irritate me a bunch of digitally multi-tracked vocals layered over one another going to the point where they're harmonized but it just kind of ends up sounding like the intro to an animal collective song I'm just kind of waiting for panda bear to jump in there ago open it open up you open up your throat and what's with the guitars dropping out for 2 minutes on Sun of light I really don't get that and I really don't enjoy it but my favorite thing about this LP the chord progressions despite the fact that this thing is so harsh and heavy and loud and in-your-face the way some of these chords resolve against each other is so rich in harmonious I feel like I'm just eating chocolate cake and I can't get enough bit like yes more more that's the way the guitars harmonize against each other on glory bronze is beautiful it moves me and it just kind of has this feeling this triumphant feeling to it but of course all this greatness comes with a bit of pretension because there is still that little manifesto dealy at least liturgy put a lot of forethought into the kind of music they want to create they didn't just simply say let's be a bit Ahmed Oh bad to me what liturgy has done is taken the sounds that they love from black metal and then put their own spin on it which I feel is the most you could ask for from any band I'm feeling a decent - strong 8 on this LP it's definitely going to be one of my metal highlights for this year I'm absolutely sure but what do you think about this thing do you love it do you hate it why and is it too soaked in pretense for you to really enjoy let me know Anthony Fantan out liturgy Aesthetica forever [Music] you 
IMRNfB8l_tU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd embarking on a new album review the Lonely Island turtleneck and chain this is going to be the first time I review a comedy album and I don't know why it's taken this long for me to do that I love comedy but comedy and music is seriously underrated by both fans and musicians and I don't know why that is maybe everybody wants to be taken seriously all the time but two of my favorite musical figures never cared about whether or not they were taken seriously like Frank Zappa and Weird Al Yankovic and I think if a group uses the right amount of comedy in their music they can still be taken seriously but stand out among their peers like Das Racist or that Ferguson Geronimo LP I reviewed recently and I'm going to assume you heard these guys if you haven't look up I'm on a boat or dick in a box both hilarious songs off of their last LP incredible and even though these guys hit it really big with their silly music videos I would argue that those tracks a lot of tracks off of that first LP are so funny that they wouldn't necessarily need a music video with it but of course there were a lot of tracks on that LP that weren't all that funny like Space Olympics and Ross Trent silly but not funny on turtleneck and chain we've pretty much got the same situation a lot of hilarious tracks but a bunch of forgettable x' - the first thing I noticed though and maybe I shouldn't even be talking about this llama Takada on a comedy record but the production on this thing the production just from the beats alone you would assume that you've got the radio tuned in to your local pop rap station especially given that we have guests here like Nicki Minaj Rihanna Justin Timberlake Snoop Dogg Akon it's almost like this LP is a little too close for comfort to the style of music that it's trying to create a slight parody of I love the opening track to this LP how it has this hard horn heavy murder rap sound but they're all rapping about how flaccid their penises are and I just had sex pretty much comes from the same exact place that I'm on a boat did that really kind of are in bead auto-tuned pop rap sound that's heavily produced but something tells me that I just had sex whether you like it or not is going to be getting blasted on laptop speakers throughout the dorm rooms of America for the next five to ten years but I think I laughed the hardest on the dubstep II I threw it on the ground which is really quotable my dad is not a phone and I'm totally forget forgetting about the title track turtleneck and chain which is the same kind of weird wardrobe humor that I get out of watching like Tim and Eric awesome show great job I'm really praying for a music video for that track and Snoop Dogg is great on it too talking about how the thinner your chain is the more gangsta it is but there are a lot of songs here where I'm not laughing at all like the creep which is pretty funny when I'm watching the music video but when the visual jokes aren't there to eight things it's a pretty boring song especially when Nicki Minaj comes in who doesn't have a joke in her verse Michael Bolton was funnier on Jack Sparrow Michael Bolton funnier than Nicki Minaj there you go there's just a good bunch of tracks here that just aren't ridiculous enough to me like shy Ronny trouble on Dookie island or after party and of course there are those tracks that have a joke in them but they repeat the joke forever until it's not funny but repeating jokes until they're not funny is a pretty SNL thing to do you know I like music to me this thing is just kind of a spotty album but should we be surprised that's how their last LP was and the thing is the Lonely Island has always been more about the single in the viral video that's what got them here and that's the formula they're going to keep going with still it's nice to have a group out there that is there to remind us that you know sometimes we're taking ourselves too seriously musicians music fans and music reviewers so I have to give this thing five out of ten big gigantic penises eight out of eight equal signs and DS and that's that's just pretty much how I feel about the album let me know what you think of this thing how would how would you score how many big giant penises with eight equal signs and DS would you give it and yeah what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana The Lonely Island [Music] 
j1JbIzOtBj4,well they're beets smoother hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd we're going to do an album review of the new wild beasts LP smother now even though the band's 2009 LP two dancers did get a lot of rave reviews this is my first time all the way through with a wild beast album and I gotta say it was pretty eccentric but I was kind of surprised to find out that when I went back and listened to the band's older stuff wild beasts seemed a little wilder and maybe this could be a good thing for newcomers like me I know at first listened I was kind of put off by a track like lion's share the opener to this album on that track there are all these really rigidly laid pianos odds singing and lyrics about a lion taking his game and honestly it kind of felt like watching a bunch of teenaged or 20-something dancers doing a stage show in nothing but pastel colored tights and animal masks just jumping around in front of trees and bushes made of cardboard I know that might be a mean thing to say but we've had a conversation like this before I like eccentricity I like oddness I like experimentation sometimes it just takes me a little while to make heads or tails of something you know figure out if I really like it and after a few listens through to this album I was hearing more of the hooks more of the melodies more of the grooves and I've kind of come to enjoy the way Haydn Thorpe vocalizes it kind of reminds me of Antony and the Johnsons but with a clearer sense of direction his voice is less winding more down-to-earth more visceral even though in comparison to their earlier stuff smother is a less fun record this is a really stone-faced set of songs a sad-faced set of songs that kind of come off very creepy or sinister like the track play thing which is kind of about conquering someone you sexually desire or the song bed of nails which seems to be on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum which is more about wanting to be with someone wanting to be with someone so much you almost go through hell of course when I'm not paying attention to the lyrics Thorpe's singing the understated somber instrumentation still implies a dark direction a lot of the hooks are pretty catchy and Haydn puts a lot of passion into his vocals that just sticks in the back of my mind plus a few tracks here can get pretty adventurous with their song structures like loop the loop is pretty progressive in the way that it builds and the bridge on that song totally takes me by surprise I guess my only real problem on this LP is the production and the mixing even though I can hear everything here it's very clear very readable everything just kind of sounds really dull and flat it's just very dry there's nothing all that interesting to me about the way these sounds come together I guess but most of the songs on this LP are so good that the mixing or the lack of effects or the lack of just really very vibrant sounds doesn't bug me I'm paying more attention to the song and paying more attention to the vocals but there are some pretty big spots on here where wild beasts rely more on their instrumentation to carry the narrative of the song without a great groove a melody and lyrics feeding into the music I just kind of feel like I'm left hanging a little bit and I love instrumental interludes I love it when songs wind into other sections but I guess I don't find the instrumental passages on this album to be all that interesting or the moments when things get really quiet drop out of tempo the percussion is taken back or even the build ups but I did like this LP a lot in fact I loved more than half of the tracks but there's still that that handful of songs that I'm just like I don't know what to do with but I'm sure that there are other people who this LP will impact a lot more than me I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thought was really good but at the end of the day I'm not in love with it I guess well what do you think of that LP do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana wild beasts smother forever 
K5AU0BHLPh0,it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd mm-hmm and it's time for track reviews today's track review is very quiet easygoing just friendly track review okay we're going to touch down on a song from the new group or double album a I a grouper is the solo project of Portland musician Liz Harris and this is what I believe is her sixth full-length Liz's stuff has dealt mostly in soundscapes that range from being noisy to folky and a lot of straight-up drones to with some flickers here and there of maybe a straightforward ish song but in 2008 grouper dropped what was to be the project's most accessible album yet though it was still really quiet really unintrusive really gentle music it was much clearer in its songwriting so how does grouper follow up this lighter sweeter moment of clarity with a double album of course AIA which is kind of broken up into two parts one of which is a lien observer and the other one is dream loss now even though there are sounds that separate these two LPs it makes sense for for one set of songs to be on one album and one set of songs to be on the other there are some textures some ideas that remain on both of them and make this kind of a unified direction for grouper for one the acoustic guitars that have twanged on previous albums are nowhere to be heard here unless they've been manipulated so much they no longer sound like acoustic guitars because the thing is I can really only guess how Liz Paris's making this music everything is so smudgy and intentionally so it's difficult to dive in and read into every detail of this music I hear a lot more keyboards on these two albums I do hear guitar but it's mostly electric guitar from what I can tell manipulated affected looped into drones alien observers really where the dreamy Tunes happen whereas dream losses where the dreamy drones happen and there are some pretty neat flavors on dream loss I saw a ray has this just mind-altering distortion on it and a tone is soft dreary gentle and yet it's also kind of sharp too dissonant really kind of stands out to me even though grouper stuff is shrouded in this veil of lo-fi she pulls together a lot of interesting textures in her music but this track that we're going to be concentrating on in this track review linked below this video on youtube and also on the needle drop comm is the title track to alien observer let's give a listen see what it has to offer there you go this track opens up with a really gentle arpeggio that pretty much lasts throughout the entire song and even though this track is just under four minutes it feels like it goes on for an eternity in a good way the music is really repetitive and maybe it's that way in in almost a therapeutic way in the same way that maybe laying in the grass at night and staring up at the sky would be therapeutic this music really kind of puts me at a place it puts me in a sense of being somewhere like no matter what time of day I play this record it is nighttime this track to me doesn't really feel like sad or dreary or happy it kind of feels like unaffected like it's coming from a place where there isn't emotion it kind of feels like nothingness emptiness vastness like a void whatever emotion is associated with nothing that's kind of what I feel like is on this track there are lyrics about being an alien observer in a world that isn't really where the character in this song is from and hopping onto a spaceship and going back to the stars though I will say it's not really the lyricism that's captivating me about this track this song does strike me as being more memorable as the others on this LP though the doubled-up vocals on the verses are kind of jumbled together don't really read all that clearly but the chorus is wind and you know intertwine together very uh very pretty way most of the songs here don't really do that though I don't really require them to either they're just ambient soundscapes that I really prefer to put on lay down to and just kind of contemplate contemplate the musical LLL think about life think about things in general think introspectively it's really not something I'm into pulling apart and analyzing dissecting to me it's kind of like being submerged in water I'm feeling like a decent seven on this track I liked it a lot I'm not in love with it but the next time I'm looking to calm down and zone out this will be the first LP I think of so what do you guys think of this track do you love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantino Grouper forever 
IT2XYrIJHSA,whoa whoa gasps oh whoa yes it's here it's finally here it is out we are listening to it and it is the best album I've ever heard in my life the best rap album I've ever heard - better than that one better than that one better than that one and better than that one it's better than it's the greatest strong strong beefy huge gigantic in your face ten strong swag swag swag swag swag swag swag swag swag swag swag are they gone hi everyone hey Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review this is the real album review not the not the decoy album review this is the real life album review in real life for you doesn't that sound nice Tyler the Creator Goblin buckle down get a glass of water maybe get a sammich because this is going to be a long one Tyler the Creator is a California rapper in the folder of Odd Future which is a rap collective that over the past couple of years have released about a dozen or so mixtapes which have received a lot of buzz on the blogosphere but more the indie rock and pop blogosphere not so much the rap blog blogosphere and these guys have publicly lashed out against some of these rap blogs in the past because they won't cover them like two dope boys and that was a blog that Tyler named on his last album bastard that I reviewed last year and liked a lot and in the time between that bastard review and today I've pretty much felt every way you possibly could about Tyler the Creator he's offensive he's stupid he's funny he's terrible he's nice he's honest he's a prima donna he's angry he's perceptive he's artistic he is human and like any human he is all of these things and also like any human on the planet Tyler is flawed and he really lets that show in his music - especially on goblin which goes in about every emotional direction you possibly could and bastard did that - but goblin is in a much different place because Tyler is in a different place in a very amount of time Odd Future has been questioned and praised by tons of music blogs and magazines I even saw today that they have a piece on the New York Times website now of course this rush of fame is going to impact the creative process but Tyler lets it affect his art in the worst way possible we're not talking about Biggie's juicy here instead of just doing his thing and making music the way he wants to make it Tyler takes his extreme lyrics his extreme statements and finds a way to preface each one of them with oh I'm not serious don't take me serious this is fiction I'm just joking this album is one minute and 13 minutes long but it could easily be 50 minutes or maybe even 40 minutes if you cut out all the references to blogs and people being offended and people talking about odd future he spends too much time addressing blog posts that people aren't even going to care about four months from now and I know Tyler likes to put on this I don't give a persona but all of these half-baked retorts prove just the opposite I guess I just don't understand all the explanations or justifications I mean yeah Tyler's got a pretty extreme mouth on him but it's not like his music is the first to be misunderstood I reviewed that Death Grips album yesterday that album is messed up do you think it's easy explaining the appeal of such an album people are going to hate things and misunderstand things and label things and box things I feel like Tyler is the only person who doesn't understand this right now if people don't get things or understand things why take the extra time to explain why make the concessions no matter what you say they're not going to like it all of these asides could be a joke for the listener keep in mind but if it is it's not a very funny joke I really don't feel like I'm listening to an album or a bunch of songs I feel like I'm reading another stupid article on some website talking about Tyler which is exactly what I didn't want because I was excited about this album because it was finally a chance to explore the music and understand the music and really just get into the music but I'm not getting a lot of music I'm just getting another heap of drama thrown into my lap so even though the disclaimers really kill the rebellious vibe of sandwiches and radicals and goblin there are a lot of moments on here where I do feel like Tyler's making music the way he wants to make it and I like that whether or not the song disappoints me I really don't like the R&B influences coming in on fish and coming in on she and I don't hold that against Tyler that's not something specific to this album that's just a style I'm not particularly into and the track analog seems like some kind of attempt to make a semi romantic sexy slow jam about chilling and partying down by the lake with snacks and drugs and girls it kind of bores me and though I find the idea of a story about a female munching vampire pretty interesting all of the really pit shifted vocals on Transylvania make the track extremely obnoxious plus all the references to bats and wolves and the beat it sounds like a terrible experiment gone wrong on a Halloween sound party cassette there's even an eight-minute Posse track on here called window which seemed like a good idea until I realized all of Tyler's friends are not as good as him when it comes to rapping not by a long shot hadji beats comes in at a close second but still a lot of the guest spots on here are filled with clumsy flows just boring rhymes bland punchlines it's just frustrating but there is a decent handful of tracks on here that I like a lot that I love to start Yonkers which every time I listen to it after I first reviewed it it grew on me a little more and a little more Tylor sounds insane on that track borderline insane the lyrics are full of memorable punchlines about Stevie Wonder xanax his therapist and also the lyrics are filled with interesting contradictions that I dig into a little bit more with each listen sandwiches is pretty good too but it just kind of sucks that two of the album's best songs were released before the album even came out but nightmare is my favorite track on this album and it's just Tyler looking into his darkest urges and laying really grim lyrics to them and it's kind of depressing to see him rip apart his life like that but at least it feels authentic at least it feels honest like he's not trying too hard he's not worried about what anybody thinks when he says what he says on that track but what's even more depressing on this hallam for me is the song her and that just shows Tyler pining for affection just desperate for affection from a girl who he has a crush on and maybe this is why or maybe one of the reasons why he acts out so much I don't know but it kind of takes me back to a time when I was young you know I was a little antisocial too but it also takes me back to the first time I listen to bastard because on bastard Tyler was making music that was confessional that was cathartic and he was making it for himself the way that he wanted to make it he wasn't explaining and re explaining the meanings behind his songs and he wasn't worried about whether or not some white soccer mom was going to be offended by it and that's pretty much it for songs that I like on this LP except for this up which I'm sure a lot of you are shaking your heads at or really confused by and I'm positively sure that it's just a walk a flock of flames spoof sometimes the lines and songs and hooks are on and when they're on they are on and sometimes they're really really really off but where I'm completely offended on this album is the beats which range from being tolerable to completely terrible the synthesizers on these songs sound like garbage spewing from the most consumer grade keyboard someone could buy at a Walmart I'm not even going to name off tracks because every track here has a synthesizer or a fake ass piano sound that is ugly as sin and makes me kind of want to throw up and then take my throw up and then pour it into my ears so I don't have to hear the sounds anymore and I don't know why the beats aren't really a part of the conversation right now because they sound like they were produced by a baby in Mario Paint music composer plus the reverb on some of these tracks especially on the vocals is extremely cheap and extremely digital and some of the mixes on these tracks are really wonky take the track radicals for example I feel like that song is something I should be jumping around too and breaking stuff too but it just kind of ends up sounding like a song I should nap too and take the instrumental a you 79 that thing is composed very lazily it's directionless it's kind of repetitive and all of its punches are pretty obvious and boring this is one of those moments where an album's production sounds exactly like its budget which I assume in this case is zero dollars this is underground this isn't that Kanye crap that's why the beats sound like that they're unsigned DJs and producers who are younger than Tyler and putting together beats that are leagues ahead of the production on here just go on datpiff just go on DJ booth go on a number brant blogs out there if you're not ignorant you've heard better beats than this so for me goblin is nowhere near as good as bastard it seems just tainted by its popularity and the thing is is that Tyler's popularity is only big within the indie community it's not big in the grander scheme of things when Kanye talks about how popular he is in his music I roll my eyes when Tyler does it I roll my eyes twice when a video clip of the President of the United States airs on CNN calling Tyler the Creator a jackass I will reconsider listening to him complain about being famous but I'm sure Tyler is serious when he says he misses Earl he doesn't like the way things are going maybe he doesn't see his mom that often he wonders why it's mostly white kids listening to his music but the faint Tyler hates is the fame Tyler once I mean I'm sure he would love a response from fox news on his little Bill O'Reilly comment on here like he couldn't have picked an easier target so basically for me this album is full of crippled beats crippled beats decent great funny masturbatory Rhymes and so-so songs and hooks I'm kind of torn on it I wanted to enjoy it I wanted to enjoy it with all of you but I kind of feel like this album is like when I went to go see Odd Future play at South by Southwest at the Billboard showcase they came out it was fury there was fire but then they just kind of decided to leave in the middle of their set and it became pretty apparent that what I was experiencing wasn't real it was an act it was a bunch of kids trying as hard as they possibly can to amuse themselves and that's fine Tyler makes music for himself he even says that on the first track of this album but I guess that means he doesn't make music for me so if you don't like this album then I guess he didn't make it for you all I know is that from front to back I did not enjoy Goblin there are some great tracks I pull out of it but you know kind of a strong for to a light five on this album but hey don't get upset don't get mad because you know what we got one of the best music videos of 2011 out of all this and you know what else goblin is nilbog spelled backwards you 
AZegHBU-ffQ,listen to me listen up don't don't type anything don't don't you know I know that there are some goblins dancing around in your heads right now but I need you I need you to pay attention this is the needle drop I Metheny Fantana the Internet's busiest music nerd we're going to do an album review Death Grips ex-military this is a free mixtape look below this video on YouTube or go punch it into the search on the needle drop calm you can download the entire thing for free this is one of those reviews where I really love what I'm hearing but I am positively absolutely sure that a lot of you are going to hate this this is some very polarizing music but here it goes Death Grips is a California rap trio according to a press release that I read every member of the group contributes to every aspect of the music whether it be the production or the lyrics whatever which is pretty interesting considering the only named member of the group is Zach Hill of hella and this is one of the most boundary challenging pieces of hip hop I've heard in a while I actually think it's weirder than one of my favorite weird takes on hip hop from last year and that's a ganja sufis a Sufi and a killer first to start with the beats on this LP Zach Hill's really really sporadic his glitchy electronics and high volume finish which I assume the other members of this group also contributed to that keeps this album really really intense from start to finish and there are a lot of parallels between this LP and the solo work of Zach Hill as well which I found myself losing patience with when I try to listen to it but that doesn't happen to me on this album there are elements of noise here elements of punk as well I even read on another blog somebody comparing this album to Atari Teenage Riot and at the risk of making a few people like cringe I have to kind of agree some of these tracks like guten tachyon just creep along with these electronic low-end rumbles and all these fad base hits that kind of feel like I'm getting shocked with a defibrillator but a majority of these tracks are Skippy skittery repetitive there are some moments where some nice samples show up like link raised Rumble yes and black flags rise above yes and I guess the last sonic quality of this LP that I want to make note of is the rapper he screams at the top of his lungs he screams his brains out on some of these tracks and I know it first that can seem a little gimmicky that oh they're just being loud to be loud but there are a lot of abstract meanings and messages and musical subtleties in this thing to be picked up with repeated listens to me this guy kind of sounds like a louder angrier version of the wu-tang clan's the RZA and if you're into music with screaming what's here really isn't going to be that much of a shock for you overall to me the beats the production on this album are solid they're untouchable they're really noisy they're really disorienting they paint an ugly background for the ugly character portrayed in the lyrics this album starts off with the track beware which introduces itself with an interview clip from none other than Charles Manson and this song kind of sets up the inner psyche of the mad man you're about to peer into talking about how he's going to the point of no return talking about how he is the beast he worships and things just get weirder from there this album kind of devolves into angry violent hobo wrap kind of a scary picture of the most primal urges that mankind has to offer the track spread-eagle cross the block and I want it I need it are kind of about being on the prowl for sex and drugs and how these addictions can strip people of their sensibilities their personalities turn a person terrible turn a person greedy turn them into monsters that make the monster on my Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy look like a muppet this album is intentionally ugly and shocking and horrifying ugly isn't supposed to be catchy or properly organized or played at a reasonable volume plus if this thing was simply about violence and sex and drugs I don't think social critiques about the Information Age like on the track culture shock would go over that well or even be there but I'm not necessarily on the bandwagon with this album if there is a bandwagon I'm into these songs with the same kind of love I would have for a really aggressive Punk tune don't get me wrong there are a few moments here where even for me I feel like this help he has gone overboard a little bit like on the oh wow on the track blood creepin and maybe also the track I wanted I needed which is six minutes long could have the same impact being three minutes four minutes but overall I still think this thing is a really intense piece of audio a great mixtape I kind of felt like I was a mischievous ten-year-old or something and I got in trouble and then I got entered into one of those scared straight programs and then I got screamed at by an inmate for 45 minutes and now I'm just fearful and paranoid of doing anything bad but still feeling a decent 8 on this enjoyed it a lot and felt it was one of the most unique experiences I've had so our this year and probably will have for this year I'm sure it will be a unique experience for some of you as well whether or not it's a positive one is for you to decide let me know love this

5chNEtG0ETI,what a gorgeous day the antlers Burst Apart hey everybody Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review the antlers Burst Apart the antlers are a new york trio from what I've read this is their fourth album and this LP comes off the heels of an album that was on a lot of year-end lists in 2009 hospice for many people a modern classic but uh not for me and I feel like I'm one of the few people who felt that way and maybe that's because on that LP I felt like the antlers were firing their sadness rays at me full blast and I was like pragmatist defense shields power on and there's nothing wrong with sad music depressing music I love getting choked up but the thing is I like it when it's a surprise music that manipulates emotions is kind of like product placement in movies if it's done subtly if it's done carefully it can be really effective seductive successful but when you have a giant banner hanging over your music that says this album brought to you by depression no emotion gets rid of happiness faster than depression I get really bored really quick and I guess I admired some of the stuff that the antlers were trying to do musically on that album but uh the lo-fi recording quality I felt hampered a lot of that potential especially when the LP got loud but that to me is kind of what makes Burst Apart the superior album I'm really glad to hear these guys in a very great recording quality this time around and also with a mix that really complements the vocal range that Peter Silberman has to offer which might just be the most distinctive thing this band has going for it and I also feel like I get a better sense of direction out of these songs too even when they're meandering or doing their instrumental thing and maybe it's because everything's clear the guitars really resonate you could pick out everything the lyrics are saying the drums are just booming they're heavy but there's a little something missing that brought so many fans to the altar of antlers and that's the storytelling there's really no overarching theme here it's just a group of 10 tracks and while there are stories tales told within some of these tracks this thing is nowhere near as lyrical as Hospice and relies a lot more on hooks to get things across there are also four tracks on here that are instrumental or are so close they might as well be and while this band can't pull a good groove together put together something delicate something that's easy to get lost in it's not really anything I'm looking forward to revisiting anytime soon overall it's just kind of sounding like a straightforward mellow slow indie rock record which makes it more accessible but also kind of makes it a little less distinct the opening I don't want love though really does stick with me I love the drums pumping on that track I really dig the opening vocal too I just kind of want to cry and make love to that song at the same time make love to somebody else to that song not like make love to the song that's can't do that no windows kind of caught my ear because it reminded me of Radiohead but it also kind of reminded me that I'd rather be listening to Radiohead every night my teeth are falling out is another spot where I catch a lot of passion a lot of fire a great hook some memorable lyrics but for a majority of these tracks I'm just kind of walking down underwhelmed Road this album closes with a set of chords that have been rocked by the best of them on the track putting the dog to sleep which kind of leads me to believe that maybe these guys aren't completely finished with trying to jam their hands into my chest and pull it my heartstrings still the track is performed really well I find a lot to love in Peters voice that track and in a weird way it kind of reminds me of George Michaels one more try and I do mean that comparison to be complimentary it's not terrible but I'm not really finding much I want to return to with this LP I could see the appeal but it's just really not for me I'm feeling like a strong four to a light five on this LP really on the fence with it overall but what do you think of this album what is your opinion on it what is your opinion on the antlers last LP and what should I review next anthony Fantana the antlers forever [Music] I got a burn on my arm it hurts right there look at that bitch 
zNbdh-JzTDY,it's track review hi everybody Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's been a while since we've done track reviews where we talk about the latest and greatest and rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent major label persuasion before we get into this review want to tell you down there linked underneath this video on youtube and also on the needle drop download a new mp3 from washed out and also watch a new music video from Holy Ghost we're going to be touching down on a track from this LP Jamie wounds mirror writing jamie woon is a UK electronic producer he's been putting out single since about two thousand seven from what i've read and it's all built up to the release of this debut album Jamie produces an interesting style of dubstep music that I would liken to artists such as scuba or mount Kimbie or especially burial who actually co-produced this track with him the single that we're going to take a listen to look for a link to it down there in the d'box on youtube ah night air alright um things i liked things i liked first off what hit me and what I enjoyed the most about this track i think was just a really reserved be the really reserved percussion behind this track which you know is is its kind of key to this style or this take on dubstep music that resonant baseline humming throughout the track i really dig as well the light airy synthesizers and echoes from the vocals just hanging around in the background really delicately like floating floating like dust and the more I guess beefy parts of the song are moving through them and they're pushing away it just it just felt like particle is just just suspended in air there are some really nice effects and details just woven into this song burial and jamie woon did a number on this track and just drummed up some really great sounds the voice is really kind of where I get lost on this track though it it performs well it gets the job done it hits the pitches it should be hitting it's on key and I guess it's kind of soulful it's soulful defer for a blue-eyed soul I guess kind of thing but it doesn't really captivate me in any way all in all I kind of feel like I'm listening to a boy bands take on dubstep and I know the style of dubstep is notorious for sounding really kind of minimal very bleak very squeaky clean and simple but still I feel like something should be sticking with me in this song I should be taking something away from this song and I really don't remember a lot of it outside of the really awesome groove at the end of this track with the baseline and the drums kind of going double time the other spots that I remember I don't remember for good reasons the lyrics about the night air and daylight filling this characters heart with sadness you can leave a comment on this video and say hey Anthony you're really cynical you're being cynical right now and I will you know message you back and say you know what you're right I am being really cynical right now this is me being cynical on this website that you should really check out called youtube.com but still I have to kind of give it to this LP for creating an interesting blend of electronic music and R&B music modern R&B and the only LPS that I could think of that that come close to this one in terms of style is kind of a james blake's latest album and what's interesting is that this jamie woon album actually has the clear-cut and straightforward songwriting that that james blake album wax to me everything on this track is so simple and so plain and so straightforward that there's nothing really left for me to engage with or explore and this could definitely resonate with anyone who's looking for a friendlier face in this rising style of dubstep music or for people who are looking for another artists to jump on the bandwagon with who have been enjoying this recent trend of artists producers taking modern R&B music and experimenting with it like how to dress well or the weekend it's all right I'm pretty much on the fence with it I'm not liking a lot about this track in particular I'm feeling like a strong 52 a light 6 on it but that's just that's just my opinion if you like it if you hate it let me know down there in the comments and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantana jamie woon mirror writing forever 
ztqWF4z9kAw,Fleet Foxes helplessness blues hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review the latest LP from Fleet Foxes helplessness blues Fleet Foxes is a Seattle band which produces very heavenly very ambitious acoustic music call it folk call it baroque call it indie folk call it whatever this my needle drops is the most romantic record of 2011 this LP is romantic because it's such an idealist album it finds love it finds beauty in in everything it finds inspiration joy melody poetry in in apples and even the fur of a collie and there's something about that that just captivates me and I'm sure a lot of people will be singing the second album blues over this LP you know is this one better is that better what does couch your chest to think you know I would buy that I'm very allergic to fish see that that doesn't even make sense because it doesn't matter what matters is do you enjoy this album I do a lot actually of course this band sound hasn't changed greatly since their last LP Fleet Foxes still has a very all guns-a-blazing approach to spinning these acoustic yarns bringing in every instrument that they can get their hands on from pianos to strings to flutes doubled-up guitars a free jazz sax phone on one of these tracks and of course the band's gargantuan vocal harmonies a better recording quality of this LP more arrangements more effects this thing just sounds like a bigger production plus I love the vocal reverb on this thing it just sounds so natural doesn't sound really synthetic like a lot of reverb do today it sounds like they're singing in a Grand Hall of some sort it's a lot to take in at once it's not easily digestible in one sitting and because of that because so much is going on things could easily go awry if you throw in too many ingredients your soup can quickly turn into slump and maybe to some of you this album sounds like nothing but an acoustic mess with vocal harmonies over it and if it does feel that way I implore you listen a little harder and also stop listening to your low bitrate album leak that you downloaded somewhere off the internet because for me this album is built so intricately it's built so masterfully I love that I can pull little sonic details from it every single time I visit it like the little strings plucking away in the right channel quietly on Sim salabim and the little notes that I pull out every time of the guitar jam at the end of that song and I really love the song subjects and the theme going on with this LP what I perceive to be a theme that is my favorite of which being helplessness blues a track that I reviewed earlier this year and to me that song is just about realizing that you're you're just a small part of this grand grand world and I haven't heard anybody sing about that with any sincerity real sincerity and passion since the microphones and that track is also just about wanting to serve a greater purpose in life something that maybe is a little more fulfilling and I can relate to that feeling sometimes I wonder if I'm on the right path sometimes I wonder if doing this is the right thing to do to me helplessness blues everything fleet as have done in the past has been improved from sound to melody to songwriting the unconventional song structures is just everything everything everything but I can still smell cynicism bubbling up fleet foxes have done this before Simon & Garfunkel crosby Stills and Nash have done this before I feel like there are some legitimate claims that could be made like maybe the vocal harmonies and the extra instrumentation in this album and maybe with Fleet Foxes just in general maybe it could be a little overbearing for some people maybe a lot of songs here kind of fizzle out or just end in a very unexpected way but I think that has created a situation that I really love about this album and that is when I put this on I really have to listen to it from beginning to end because I feel like every song here would be weaker if you pulled it out of the album and listened to it by itself every track has a different part of the story to tell in this old dusty leather-bound book that I'm flipping through in a rocking chair on a creaky wood floor next to a window with the morning light creeping in fires lit five feet away from me an old hound dog is sitting at my feet and I am sipping some herbal tea I mint so I'm feeling a light to decent 9:00 on this one guys uh enjoying it a lot but you know what scores don't matter listen to this for yourself make your own decision and if you don't like it you don't like it all right but I love it I'm loving it okay all right Fleet Foxes helplessness blues forever 
eVh01VJmt3o,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd going to do a question of the week and admit something to you right now on live television that I have an addiction and a website certain website allows me to indulge in this addiction it's a website by the name of rate your music calm and what I like to do is go on this website and read fiercely negative mean-spirited and sometimes very well-written reviews of my favorite albums of all time there's just something about being interested in hearing somebody completely diss the new LCD soundsystem album or LPS from Talking Heads permission of Burma or Dead Kennedys or even Public Enemy or The Beastie Boys that totally totally interests me so basically what I want to ask you is what do you think of negative opinions I know that a lot of you request that I review stuff maybe because you love the album and you want another positive opinion on it you're hoping I'll like it as well but what do you feel about negative opinions when you see a negative opinion about something that you like and what if it's really well-written and what if the person who writes it has a point how do you feel what do you think is the music bad then did they persuade you have I persuaded you to not like something if I have that wasn't my intention but still the negative opinions affect you and if they do how do they change your mind and make you hate something or do they make you actually feel stronger in your position screw that guy screw his point of view I'm gonna like this more now I like it more oh do you laugh and shrug it off because it's not a big deal and should musicians put all that much stock into negative opinions of their own work should musicians go around reading reviews of their own stuff and if they do should they take the negative reviews to heart as much as they do the positive reviews because I think people whether they're musicians or not should be very wary of stuff that is fiercely fiercely blindly positive but also also salsa so also so though extremely negative I love it that I can come on here and give a positive opinion of an album that I love and then you will go check it out most of the time and maybe you'll end up liking it yourself too but if a positive opinion can affect you in that way do my or anyone's negative opinions affect you in the other way let me know Anthony Fantana negative opinions forever [Music] you

qwRR5uCTvas,he's like that big of a shock it's like every album that's been really hyped or really popular since like November just hasn't like lived up to the the hype behind it I guess for me but okay just not it's not huge not amazing no no I like that Beastie Boys album yesterday implying what that they're cool well they are haters gonna hate hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd it's I hate the Internet it's time for an album review of the new explosions in the sky LP take care take care take care these guys are a Texas instrumental rock outfit it's been four years since they've followed up their last LP all of a sudden I miss everyone no ep's no singles no phone calls and I would be lying if I didn't say I didn't that this waiting period was going to result in some kind of great realization or change for the band and I've been listening to this LP on and off since I got the promo version of it and I'm just visiting it and revisiting it and waiting for the moment where it just clicks with me and makes my brain happy because right now I feel like I'm in a coma I'm in a weird alternate dreamworld where I don't love the new explosions in the sky LP and I just want to wake up from this horrible nightmare but I do feel like my enjoyment or lack thereof of this album has been horribly horribly mutilated by my love of this group's past work to me explosions sound improved greatly from tell the truth - all of a sudden those early albums do have a lot of beauty to them but you know in retrospect they are kind of just a little bit rough around the edges and now that the band's sound is huge they have achieved epic where do you go from there where do you go from there when your sound is so dependent upon this loud soft dynamic explosions in the sky is kind of sticking to their guns on this record much of what is on this LP sounds exactly like what is on their last LP the guitar still shimmer the same way the drums are still really loud the snare sound like pistols are going off the bass drums sound like bombs are blowing up in the distance but there are a few instrumental additions to this album that are put on here to kind of give the the appearance of evolution and progression in terms of style noticing some acoustic guitar on here that I like don't know why the band wasn't using it more on their past couple LPS also noting some string work as well so subtle that you wouldn't even really notice it unless you were listening really really hard just really paying attention to the music leaning over in your seat and engaging with it but there are some things on here I don't care for at all like the loop percussion some of what I think sounds like hand percussion on some of these tracks that I really don't care for also the wordless vocals not that I prefer them to have words but these really spectral moans and the humming these hums just don't really add much to the tracks for me I guess my problem is that I don't really love not one single track on this album from beginning to end but I do find myself gravitating towards certain spots in these songs though the middle of be comfortable kind of underwhelmed me but I love the descending guitar melody over that part of the song and the really droney guitar outro on that is nice too great sounds and i love the twinkling intro on postcard before the primal drums come in and just start thumping really hard and kind of ruining what could have been a very delicate moment hello that first explosion of guitars after the band stops playing with that hip hop beat not say the band has never done stuff like that before I'm the track let me back in but I still can't say I'm enjoying this album as a whole though and I know a lot of you guys are and that's fine I'm still just kind of mixed though I know that the feelings on this album are nowhere near as depressing or desolate on all of a sudden I miss everyone but I can't help but feel like in a way I've kind of gotten the same record over again because when it comes to how these guys build their songs they're still doing it in a really predictable way I'm talking about the way these guys layer their tracks when they introduce new melodies how long they lay on climax how long until that climax actually gets here so I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this album it was alright but how do you feel about this record are you loving it are you hating it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana explosions in the sky take care take care take care further yeah wear shorts black socks or what so what 
qv-cNmuNi64,rap song break the break of dawn singing on and on and smoking smoke the ball eat your salad tongs walk along Beastie Boys the hot sauce committee part 2 hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd in its review time we're talking about the new Beastie Boys LP hot sauce committee part 2 and yes I saw fight for your right revisited and it was hilarious but this album is no laughing matter let me just get that straight I've been listening to this New York rap trio for a long time I've loved a lot of their LPS again and again and again and a lot has been said about those albums so I won't bore you with a similar rant about those LPS here but I will say that this comes off the tail of my least favorite Beastie Boys album if you don't count the instrumental to mix up and I know that's cliche to say a lot of people didn't like the five boroughs but that LP pales in comparison to their others to me because every Beastie Boys album up until that point had something sonically or stylistically that was kind of innovative about it each album has its own different vibe and feel throughout and I wasn't really hearing that on the five boroughs it didn't really feel like the Beastie Boys were pushing their sound like I'm so used to hearing them do now after numerous listens to the hot sauce committee I feel like this is the LP that should have come out after hello nasty mostly because I see so much of hello nasty in this but pushed a lot further it actually feels like a continuation of the story of the sound hello nasty the last LP the Beastie Boys produced with mario.c had a lot to love about its concept its fusion of this futurist hip hop electro hybrid just think of the robot in the intergalactic video except now he's tricked out with GPS navigation and cupholders and seat warmers and it's the year 4000 and next but the first single I reviewed from this LP makes a noise had extremely buzzing distorted synthesizers big fat massive bass frequencies crisp drums really odd samples throughout lots of different vocal eq's and effects tons of textures and that's not the only track that is just a plethora of different sounds I could just crank this album and feel mmm just this wall of nice nests and while this thing is clean deep and very resonant it's also trippy psychedelic noisy messy with lots of space echoes with sounds bleeding into one another covering each other there's just so much going on in each one of these songs it's literally listening to color another track I love the sound of is too many rappers the bass programming just that electric that thing is just a few shades away from being a dubstep song it's really difficult to explain the Sonics of this album in a concise way because every track pulls from a different style or idea or set of electronics or sounds and yet it all comes together so cohesively in this electro fried set of new sounds as well as some old production tricks that you'll probably remember from hello nasty and he'll communication I could just go on about every track because all of them are extremely detailed and I see myself picking up new things every time I revisit it now as far as the ryan game goes this thing is pretty much a typical Beastie Boys album don't look to have your mind blown in this department but that's not necessarily a bad thing but I do kind of miss the days of Eggman and Paul Revere where the Beastie Boys really used to use their lyrics to paint a full story from beginning to end something I could really chew on for the most part the hot sauce committee is funny punchlines non sequiturs obscure references absurd lyricism some lines come off corny er than others sillier than others but that all adds up to the theme the idea of this LP and that's just kind of have fun I love that I can seriously groove to the bassline the Funkadelic esque baseline on funky donkey and then laugh my ass off at the Larry routine right after and I know that may not sound fun to someone who wants to put on an album fold their arms and go hmm but that's the way it is however I can't help but do that so there are a few spots of this LP that don't quite do it for me over the course of their career the Beastie Boys haven't had a lot of features on their albums but for some reason nas just kind of comes out of nowhere and ends up on too many rappers but nas being on that track kind of displays to me why it's difficult to have another rapper come onto a Beastie Boys track and that is in comparison to the Beastie Boys pretty much every rapper sounds like they're taking a nap when they rap it's because the Beastie Boys are so high-pitched they're so loud they're so in-your-face they're like yelling and rapping at the same time and nas just kind of feels a little buried though when I listen to this track really hard he lays down some really good verses I guess the other issues that I have with this LP are the detours that it takes here and there like the reggae and dancehall feel don't play a game that I can't win featuring Santigold and also Lee Majors come again which is kind of a punk rock tune and I know the Beastie Boys have punk rock in their background they like showing off how eclectic they are and that's fine I just find it difficult actually fitting those songs into this album mentally for me and those are my gripes about this LP and the thing is they feel to me like I'm kind of nitpicking because even at this album's worst it's so pretty good as a whole I'm loving this album I enjoy it more and more every time I spin it so I'm feeling a strong eight to a light nine on this album yeah and I hope you're enjoying it as much as I am Anthony Fantana The Beastie Boys Hot Sauce committee part 2 forever [Music] uhh 
f6df3Yo-aSE,"shhh hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd thank you for being here thank you for subscribing and watching it's time for a review although many of you who saw yesterday's video might have seen that toward the end of the video it kind of derped a little bit hurt a little bit in derped a little bit and guess who was supposed to be editing the video I am 25,000 subscribers trying to run a tight ship here and you're ruining it I have cow's headphones on he's listening to warm rot on repeat I had him listening to Rebecca Black at first but he liked that so he's going to sit there and take his punishment and we are going to partake in an album review cunning linguist is a Kentucky rap outfit this is their fifth LP owner ology following up 2007's dirty acres and even though there was a gap of time in between these two LPS it's not like they were just sitting around and doing nothing there were guest spots there were solo efforts there were mixtapes full of b-sides and remixes and live tracks so now they're back with owner ology hope I'm pronouncing that correctly and that according to wicked wicked wicked wicked you wikki wikki wikki wikki dia is the scientific study of dreams but this LP isn't just about the images that you see in your head while you're sleeping it's got a much broader definition than that dreaming on this album also goes into fantasies desires dark thoughts goals that you aspire to very vulnerable moments you wouldn't let anybody else know about take the opening track of this LP perfect start to this album it's at that point where the mind is about to go off into sleep rhymes about the brain and omens and seeing signs and your dreams trying to figure out what they mean DJ cuts of a biggie small vocal going it was all Maddie and Deacon the villain bring fantastic flows onto this track too and I love how when they're rapping I'm feeling what they're feeling in their rhymes when they're angry I feel it when they're fearful I feel it what makes that emotion have so much more impact is of course the beats and production behind that stuff brought to the table by know his production has most likely been the cunning linguist most distinct characteristic going back to the project's first album and what makes nose beats great has gotten even better on this LP for me just to put it simply they're really really really pretty there are a lot of atmospheric melodies just hanging in the background a lot of great vocals and samples and sounds that progress some of these tracks progress more than others on here so it's not like you're listening to just one sample repeated over and over and over I'm actually travelling through the song and for me it's made the tracks really really cinematic it's like watching a fight scene in slow motion or something like that it's just the sound of of greatness there's just this undeniable sense of ambition and some of these instrumentals though I will say there are like a handful of tracks here that do come off a little too - squeaky clean with their production or their hooks kind of recreating a situation that I didn't really care for on Lupe Fiasco's new album for the most part I've got great beats I have great flows and I can just kind of kick back enjoy the atmosphere and really kind of delve into what some of these songs mean I really love the tracks hard as they come and murder they feature guest spots from Freddie Gibbs and Big KRIT and those tracks are kind of about the terrible things people might do if nothing was stopping them another track I like a lot get ignorant is about how living in a dream isn't necessarily happening while you go to sleep because a lot of people live in a dream of sex vanity celebrity drama material things music sometimes the production as flashy and as enjoyable as it is can kind of overtake the rhymes especially on a track like star shine bright and with the subject matter of this album some of the ideas some of the lyrics can come off kind of corny despite the seriousness I feel from this piece of work there are a few spots where I kind of felt myself cringing a little bit but still overall love the beats love the concept love the Rhymes love this album feeling a light too decent 8 what do you think about this thing loving it hating it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan Oh cunning linguists owner ology forever "
1EWVlDIRUR4,"you'll Callaghan hey everyone Bob Dylan is like my my best friend these days Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's review time thank you for watching thank you for being here oh yeah and we just broke 25,000 subscribers on the YouTube channel yes it means a lot that you guys watch seriously I'm flattered every day that you do so let's talk about the new Bill Callahan LP apocalypse this is Bill's third album under his own name but his discography goes all the way back to about 20 years ago when he used to release music under the name Smaug and the guy has one of the most interesting trajectories I've ever heard if you go back and listen to an early Smaug album like Julius Caesar you would never guess that that is the same guy that has made Apocalypse and today Bill's music has kind of settled into a series of very gentle gentle understatements simple acoustic guitar simple bass simple drums with very light flourishes of strings piano harmonica some electric guitar there are even two tracks on here that feature flute solos but overall this is what I'd like to call an honest-to-god recording there's not a lot of studio trickery here not a lot of flash all the instrumentation here aside from some light reverb here and there is very dry very straightforward plus the sound here goes a lot nicer with the themes of Americana that run throughout these tracks talking about images of drovers pushing cattle along wide open spaces purple mountains Majesty buffalo freedom Johnny Cash this land is your land this land is my land this help he opens up with my favorite song on the album drover which dives into the minor details of cattle driving so minor it's kind of difficult to grab a greater understanding of what the storyline is or what the purpose of the character is other than where he is living can really break the back or break the mind a weaker man I can only guess that Callahan gets a rush from the imagery that he's painting in this song and I got to admit even though I can't really relate to the situation I find it pretty captivating too I love how the simple instrumentation in this track just Falls and swells along with the tension in the lyrics it's easily one of my favorite opening tracks this year but this LP never really reaches that same level of excitement for me again even though I did kind of fall in love with writing for the feeling on first listen tell me what you think but in my opinion bill is kind of delivering his songs a little differently on this LP then he used to the pacing on some of these tracks is much much slower and sometimes the details are a little more vague take two tracks baby's breath and Universal applicant both have really interesting tales inside of the lyrics and the first one a marriage goes sour and in the second bill kind of takes out a boat that he is on with a flare gun but these details don't really seem all that apparent since they take so long to tell and even when you compare this stuff to Bill's previous album the sentiments there are much much clearer plus on the track Universal applicant bill just rambles on after his boat happens to be going down and saying and the punk and the lunk and the drunk and the skunk and the hunk and the monk in me the meanings behind some of these lines are so singular that the only really truly means something to bill even on a really urgent track like America which has a pretty straightforward dance beat burnin guitar solo and funky strumming I think it's about one man's struggle to accept where he is from bill is acknowledging that we have great people great heroes who have come from America but then again he turns around and says but there's not enough to eat because of his deadpan voice because of his esoteric lyrics and I will say that's what attracts me to his music because of that stuff bill is not the easiest guy to read on the planet but I usually don't have this much trouble grabbing an understanding of his work or enjoying it I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this album I liked it but not a lot it's definitely not my favorite Bill Callahan album hmm but what do you think about this record are you loving it hating it why is it one of your favorites of this year and what should I review next and what does Cal think of Bill Callahan it means a lot that you guys watch seriously I'm flattered every day I really worry about cow's mental health forever you "
deKmw1zDkGc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana the Internet's busiest music nerd here nice to meet you if this is your first time watching this is the needle drop where we blah blah blah Blau the it's album review time the kills blood pressures these guys are an English outfit this is their fourth LP back in the early 2000s musical duo's who were reviving blues rock and garage rock or a hot commodity between the White Stripes The Black Keys and The Kills these three bands that I mentioned all have their respective styles takes on the genres that influenced them and images too but time and time again The Kills have just been my my least favorite and the issues that I've had with their past LPS kind of continue on to this album I would figure The Kills would be my favorite band of the three they're willing to get dirtier than a lot of groups playing this style of music experimenting a lot with noise guitar effects distortion keeping the drums really simple and rudimentary but I guess what keeps the kills from clicking with my cranium is just the attitude that comes with this album not really agreeing with me some people would call it cool cool od act so cool I would say it's more tortured or maybe trying to be tortured it's just dark music with a dark attitude and I've heard and loved plenty of music that tries to go that route but the moodiness the kills Laysan to their music has always struck me as something that doesn't have much more to an outside of some black clothes an extra eyeshadow and maybe that's intentional maybe that's as far down into the abyss as the band would like to go I'm not knocking them for that I'm just saying that's not something that really appeals to me that's all and maybe I'm knocking on them too much but the thing is there's nothing really here musically or sonically on this album that pulls my attention away from that much of the time on this LP the songwriting really underwhelmed me or just doesn't hit me as memorable there are only a few tracks on here that really left a mark on me DNA has a really great groove that track is just sexy for back of a letter word back of a letter word for lack of a better word and the last goodbye despite some lyrics that I don't really like has a great vocal delivery from Alison Mosshart really heartfelt something I felt like I was sympathizing with but outside of those songs I'm just either disliking or just kind of so-so with the tracks on this album I don't feel what The Kills do is terrible or offensive it's just not for me I'm feeling a strong for to a light five on this LP people ask me all the time stuff like Anthony how can you like bluff at the DA when you don't like or do like that da and honestly I wonder that too I don't know if I had all the answers I I'd be a rich man but all we can do now is just ask couch or chest Oh what he thinks of the kills murderer is illegal don't we all Anthony Fantana that kills blood pressures forever 
DSjCcInCqOk,hey how are you I haven't seen you in a while Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for your review thank you for watching the new tune-yards LP who kill tune-yards is the solo project of singer-songwriter merrill Garbus though she did take on the brenner basis as a collaborator for this LP now Merrill's first LP bird brains was really all over the place with its influences but still had a very concise style and delivery just lots of eccentric tunes with acoustic instrumentation backed with beats from all around the world but for me the low fat recording of that album didn't really match up with the ambition of what was trying to happen in some of the songs and maybe Meryl felt the same way since who kill is a huge improvement in terms of sound quality not only is everything here clearer and layered and eq'd but there's a lot more instrumentation on this thing there's more electric guitar more dub effects on the electric guitar horns tons of horns sometimes I think I'm here in a thumb piano or a xylophone I'm not sure more bass more drums more backup vocals - Merrill seriously takes advantage of this new level of fidelity by just loading it with instrumentation to the point where some of these tracks become really really overwhelming a real frenzy the voice is on here are mixed really panoramic Lee - sometimes Merrill is in your left ear sometimes she's in your right sometimes she's really quiet and distorted sometimes she's really loud and in-your-face she's like a wild animal in the jungle jumping around from Bush to Bush and she's gonna jump in your face Burnett you this thing is really bold it's bright its in-your-face it does not give off its eccentric and booming with personality some great grooves good bass lines some great melodies here and there and it's memorable love this thing or it's going to leave a mark on you now the cons this music is perfect prey for cynicism this is the kind of stuff that that cynicism loves to eat for dinner like why does she use African influences or why does she wear face paint that's stupid when people act strange opinions polarized it happened with Dirty Projectors it happened with me chew on the album jewelry too and I would compare tune-yards to those bands not only because of their sound and their influences but also because they're all willing to hungrily pass on to every creative idea that just kind of happens to be scurrying by and because of that who kill covers a wide range of emotions lyrical subjects densities and sounds for example the track wall-e wall-e gong this six minute winding acoustic piece is like this quiet pop hole on this LP that is nowhere near as spazzed out as some of the other Tunes here but on the other end of wall-e wall-e gong you have gangsta which is this track just bursting with the eccentricities that make this LP the unique construction paper snowflake that it is there all these mouths gun and siren sounds and just fat blaring horns screaming vocals schizophrenic whispers in the background just like a coffin e of percussion lyrical references to Rastas and gangsters and my hood I don't think I'm out of line in saying that that track is really really annoying it's like a disgustingly gigantic bowl of Froot Loops it's just a little much but business the first single from this album is the perfect blend to me of eccentricities melody rhythm and just catchy song writing that makes this LPS highs so high the track doorstep after that seamlessly blends the 60 soul vocals style into the track that taking away from the aesthetic of the album nice I just want to say that yes I know that Merrill's voice is not the most accessible and it really didn't do me any favors when I first came upon it either but with multiple listens I kind of found this interesting and drogyny to it on some of these tracks I find it really difficult to place a gender on the voice and that has kind of kept me attentive for some reason another track I didn't really care for on this LP is Killa which closes the album off and it's just kind of anticlimactic it feels really really unfinished in comparison to some of these multi instrumental multi-layer giants there are spots that overwhelm there are spots that underwhelm but I'm completely smitten with everything that's in between so what to do I thought it was a fun album I promise your first listen to this will either make you completely lovestruck or pissed off and if you're the latter then stick with it a little bit longer take your cynicism put it in your pocket and maybe you'll come to a happy middle ground like I have feeling a light 7 on this definitely not blowing my mind as a whole but some really great tracks on here then I'm gonna remember by the end of the year Anthony Fantana tune-yards who kill forever 
JEML7td1D3s,why to grind reviews in one day because I want to this is Anthony Fantana the needle drop reviews worm rot is a Singapore grindcore outfit this is their second LP dirge it's also been reviewed by bros like yak sniffer and jgc sound and they both talked about this new LP and we're very positive about it so I figured why not listen to them and I'm glad I did I'm like rotten sound and a lot of grindcore groups with modern metal production worm rot leaves it up to the Vans energy their playing ability they're in the moment sound their personal intensity as musicians to make their grindcore entertaining they're not overly reliant on studio magic to bring the noise so it kind of sounds a little bit like a throwback I think we can all agree that grindcore is a genre of extremes with one band making a name for themselves by trying to be louder or faster or just crazier than the next if you actually read into the history of the genre in the book choosing death which was actually recommended to me by yaks if ur napalm death kind of came into their own just through the search of looking for a drummer who could play faster-faster-faster a lot of bands after napalm death have been locked into this fleeting search for a more intense sound more intense style more intense recording and you know what in that search something has kind of been lost and whatever that something is warm rot has found it and made an album with it I know that sounds corny but I feel that way sincerely these guys don't just sound like a metal band playing too fast they sound like the old days when grindcore was an even blend of thrash metal and hardcore punk too many people forget the hardcore punk every time I listen to this thing I feel like I get to know the record a little bit more I'm actually learning things from it actually gaining something from it I'm not just getting a headache from an extreme mix I'm seeing more detail in the drumming more detail in the riffs the various sections of these guys throw into their 30 second songs the vocals are always switching up from track to track - sometimes there are these harsh hi wretches there are these guttural lows as well at some points the vocals are more intelligible than others which just makes it easy to break these songs up when one ends one starts you can tell the difference between these tracks the shortest track here is about 3.5 seconds and I think the title is actually a reference to napalm death themselves the shortest song on their first record was titled you supper and the title from this LP is you suffer but why should I care I'm just speculating at that point but anyway this thing is not just constantly blasting my face off it has a lot of highs a lot of lows there's variation just a lot of great grooves a lot of thrash riffs it's 25 tracks 18 minutes of intensity earache records is actually giving this thing away as a free digital download before it's released physically I look forward to listening to this thing on and off throughout the year plug these guys again check them out yaks never and jgc sound on youtube they are linked in the description box below this video they have much better opinions on tons of music I don't usually talk about ok worm rot dirge the needle drop light 8 thank you for watching for [Music] you 
1clWfouQyjg,Renko review should be short and fastened to the point just like right garfish know what I said there I don't care review rotten sound cursed I'm Anthony Fantana and this is the needle drop thank you for watching these guys are a Finnish band this is their 6th LP which is pretty surprising considering that these guys have had numerous lineup changes and they play music in a genre that is notorious for having bands with short lifespans is napalm death really a band I mean they're more like a club of people whose members keep leaving grindcore is notorious for being fierce disorienting and relentless and run sound is definitely all of that but what separates this LP from their past work and some of the work of other grindcore acts is that they have a heavy emphasis on a really professional production sound and presentation to me the last of their dirty side kind of dissipated on 2005 exit they went on to a slightly glossy er sound on cycles and now here they're sounding like produced to the nines but that hasn't really led to a cleaner friendlier aesthetic or anything like that I actually think it makes the picture rotten sound tries to paint even uglier and more detailed imagine the difference between looking at a grainy photograph of a corpse and then being face-to-face with that corpse now the production is really massive heavy thick the drums feel like I'm getting punched in the gut meanwhile the distorted bass riffs and guitar feel like equally heavy blows to my skull and it's not like this thing just blows by in a flurry of blast beats I mean nearly every track here does settle into a groove at one point definitely a lot of these songs number from one to two minutes really impressive drum fills some great guitar solos especially on the track Hollow but the issue I'm having here is the same issue I have with a lot of grindcore LPS yeah as soon as the initial shock of speed and volume wears off I'm just like grabbing it nothing all I did is this really false heaviness from the way that it's produced I'd like to feel the energy of this record from the band from their playing not from a lot of compression on the guitars not a really really high volume mastering job in the studio what I hear on here is just not a really natural sound and that doesn't excite me the way this LP is executed I feel like the guys in this group could play this music and I'm sure they could in their sleep and that doesn't make me really impressed as a musician but not all that exciting as a listener I guess overall it's okay maybe if you want to listen to grindcore for its musicianship but for me that's not really what I'm looking for in this style check it out links to listen below rotten sound forever 
IfnHn2hWWzA,lady gaga Judas sup sup sup sup sup hi everybody Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd this is the needle drop where we blah blah blah about nah and it's review time album review time just letting you guys know linked below this video on YouTube and in the mp3 section on the needle drop comm we have new tracks from My Morning Jacket and do metal band Indian check them out I know some of you guys freak out when I review something do popular or too obscure but I don't care I review what I want Foo Fighters have been played on the radio like crazy since I was about nine I remember hearing and enjoying I'll stick around and this is a call on the radio like two to three times a day back when I basically lived off of my boombox and of course the Foo Fighters had even more radio play on their next LP s with monkey wrench ever long my hero learned to fly even when I was growing into Punk in high school their songs were still kind of following me around and now it's present-day and I have to say in retrospect Foo Fighters have been one of the most consistent bands to start in the 90s and grow into the 2000s you pretty much always knew what to expect from the band on the next album even if some LPS did have more acoustic ballads than others now wasting light has been built up to be this kind of return to form for Foo Fighters they're a rock band again it's even been said to be their heaviest album yet and if that's true it's it's only heavier by a slight slight margin there are moments here where Foo Fighters pull from the punk and hard rock sounds that they used to on their early stuff back when Foo Fighters was really just kind of a Dave Grohl solo project there's a song on here white limo which I'm sure you've seen the music video for hilarious video but that track in case you didn't know sounds a lot like a track the first LP weenie beanie with its distorted vocals and really hot guitar leads and there are tracks here I'm catching that same mix of aggression and hook power that made so many songs on their second album like radio classics for example bridge burning the opener a matter of time too now in terms of production this thing the guitar tone the bass just the mix it's really thick and aggressive for an all rock record really kind of reminds me of Queens of the Stone Age rated R type stuff at some moments everything is densely packed but it's easy to pull apart without relying on a lot of compression that drowns out the subtleties and the dynamics of the music but still stays really heavy of course this heaviness is only relative but the band never strays away from that electric guitar there's not an acoustic ballad in sight on this thing even when Foo Fighters are playing with accordion and and string arrangements on the track I should have known now despite all the hype behind the cell P and all the volume on it I have a hard time seeing this as a return to form because for me there's a certain sound and style on this album that I don't usually associate with these guys and that's arena rock just arena rock power ballads if you look at hooks on tracks like our laundry ax or back and forth tracks like this change this album from being a rock album into a rock album I could totally picture a light show going on behind this lots of guys wearing headbands and singing into the same microphone back-to-back like yeah yeah yeah and I think it's cool that the Foo Fighters were able to take that influence and repurpose it within their own style in a way that blends in pretty well but to me part of the reason this LP is so infectious in a way is that it's loaded with these lyrical motifs that have been xeroxed again and again and again one of these days you and what army it's alright once upon a time burning bridges what's in it for me it's just a matter of time we're going nowhere fast easy for you to say Blanc Blanc go away again another get away get away get away get away get the lp's lyrical content basically lumbers around like a Frankenstein monster sewn together from all of these fatherless phrases and it's like ah this thing doesn't have any of the quirk of the Fu's early early lyricism and it's definitely kind of barren when it comes to those really beautiful personal unique statements that Grohl used to make with tracks like my hero I will say there is an exception with the last track on this album though walk which seems to me to be about getting kicked off your horse getting back on starting at the beginning again overcoming adversity awesome inspirational all of my gripes about the lyrics aside this could just be another element of the Foo Fighters getting back to not what I think is their roots but just simplicity and volume and energy this thing is bookended with two fantastic tracks there are several within the middle that I liked a lot too but about half of the songs here I am kind of on the fence with I wasn't really hating anything on here but then again it's designed it's engineered to be catchy this thing is a volume heavy piece of power pop pretty much just what the Foo Fighters do best it's one of their most consistent releases in years I think it's probably more consistent than their past three to four records so I'm fairly positive on this Foo Fighters release I'm feeling like a a strong six maybe on a great day a light seven but pretty much a strong six but that's what you wanted you guys asked for this review and now it's here tell me what you think about this LP do you like it do you hate it why and what should I review next thank you for watching really thank you anthony Fantana Foo Fighters wasting light forever [Music] 
yEd2D-ukjZs,why everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd back again for another album review before we get into this I want to tell y'all that I have done two reviews okay of the new Vivian girls LP share the joy and also of the new mono/poly EP manifestations you can find them linked below this video on youtube or listed in the reviews section on the needle drop dot-com Metronomy is an English quartet and this is their third LP the English Riviera which sounds like a vacation destination and it is that sonically but I wouldn't take your husband or wife there they might think you're a cheapskate but like this band or dislike them something that no one can say about this album is that metronomy did not progress these guys shifted from a pretty instrumental style to some really quirky synthesizer pop with vocals in their first two albums and now here they're mellowing out a lot more and concentrating on what makes an album great songwriting plus they're kind of subtracting out what made the band sound so idiosyncratic or odd for all intents and purposes Metronomy is still an indie pop band I don't like that term that much with a really big crush on dance beats and synthesizers but they're looking a lot leaner now like they've been working out there doing their push-ups they're doing their pull-ups they've been running a couple 10ks and they've just come out of the shower dripping with condensation wearing a towel and they look sexy candles are lit rose petals are strewn about the floor because this is one of those get close and personal kind of albums or at least it sounds that way some of the lyrics here do deal with some less love smitten topics sometimes relationships do Arai but the way the lyrics are written the way they're delivered with the vocals I really feel like I sympathize with some of the talks going on in this LP like I really feel the exhausted tension on the track she wants or even the sensuality and we broke free or the love connection lost but found again and everything goes my way but this LP does have its highs and it's lows for me when this thing is at its best it's producing just heavily heavily orchestrated pop music that leaves no stone unturned and no vocal on harmonised we broke free has a really angelic build with a steady beat of bass and drums behind it all these synthesizers swelling in vocals bouncing off of each other it's got a really sexy sexy sway and it all evolved toward these multi-layered guitar solos that create this burning wall of sound and just so many emotions are hitting me at once on that track I love it I love the little flourishes of backup vocals in the duet direction the second track on this LP takes it really kind of melts my heart on a song that I might have otherwise been cynical toward for me this thing is really enjoyable up until the last third of the LP where I feel like the band kind of leaves me hanging out to dry a little bit because they focus away from their songwriting and more on what I think is most likely the weakest thing on the English Riviera and that's the instrumentation now I'm not talking about the melodies or the chords none of that I'm talking more about the sounds here the way this thing was mixed the track loving arm has extremely muddy synthesizers all over that track and the fact that that number stays a little too quiet for me kind of underwhelmed the drums especially the snare drum on a lot of these songs just feel so buried and dull and kind of forgotten on the last two tracks of this LP the band tries to string their songs out and create a groove something that's in the moment maybe sort of sounding like a jam but it's just not doing a lot for me I wish it sounded a little more urgent or fevered but it just doesn't overall I don't hate the way this LP sounds I just feel like this here are just a standard they just kind of get the job done if the sounds were a particular taste they would be room-temperature coffee no cream no sugar what has kept me interested in this LP though is the combination of just great songwriting great arrangements and melody some interesting lyrics here and they are peppered throughout the album that seem kind of odd sound aside that to me is what makes this LP pretty good and worth a listen and I'm definitely going to be revisiting some of the tracks on this album especially the first three to four so if you like your dance pop to not sound too electronic you like it to be performed at a at a more reasonable volume feeling a s strong seven on this LP enjoyed it quite a bit not in love with it but let me know what you think about this record are you loving it are you hating it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana metronomy forever 
g49eVqxqFLo,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd haven't done a question of the week in a little while to something that is stressed again and again and again in tons of reviews I've read I think maybe even I have stressed this point before and also in a lot of comments I've also read this complaint or this accusation or this criticism that a band is not original this is not original doesn't sound original enough where's the originality is originality really all that important to your enjoyment when you're listening to a group and maybe they sound a lot like another group in your head do you automatically feel like that's a good thing or a bad thing you guys can imagine the amount of music I listen to because of this channel not only have I listened to a lot of music before this channels existence but because of it I listen to a lot more than I think I would otherwise so if hearing something brand freaking new something that is totally alien to me is what made me is it good in my head I would be enjoying virtually nothing I listen to because like I said pretty much everything reminds me of something in some way tons of music has been written with the same four or three chords again and again and again but the thing is a song a piece of music isn't just chords it's also the melody over it it's the way the singer sings it's the tone on the guitar players amp it's also the way the song was produced how the bass was mixed plus I'm sure you have heard a record that sounded original in the sense that you've never ever come across anything like it but you hated it it sounded like crap it was annoying so originality is it what makes music interesting entertaining or do you find it really easy to get into or enjoy an album when an artist or a band kind of wears their influences on their sleeve not only do I feel like originality is ever so slightly overrated but a lot of the time what you may perceive as being original might not be so much so are you positively sure you're aware of every single piece of music that might have had an influence upon the one that you deemed to be original so is originality important to you let me know Anthony Fantana originality forever [Music] you 
lvnSmbU4nWY,oh my god oh my god thank you thank you for for making the needle drop something that that I do all the time because it's fun the needle drop is where we bla bla bla about lalalala I'm Anthony Fantana the Internet's busiest music nerd on the needle drop com if you're not already there some people were asking me to review that new arctic monkey single I did in an audio podcast it's linked down below the video right here in the YouTube description box so this is crystal silts new LP in love with oblivion the follow-up to their 2009 album it's not as funny as you think it is the album is clearly on the Wow just use the album out of the while it's not that it's not a good joke it's not a good joke well in in love with oblivion to me is a rock n roll nightmare use your imagination what would a rock and roll nightmare be a dream or a nightmare is something that isn't all that clear or detailed in retrospect and I would say that is a good description of this especially since everything is slathered in reverb and a lot of groups use reverb on their records to sound larger-than-life but that is definitely not the case here the reverb here is used more to obscure and veil the instrumentation on these songs especially the vocals another thing that reminds me of dreams actually is that there's a lot of surreal and strange imagery that isn't really explained most of the time the opening track sycamore tree kind of sets the stage for that which has a really spotty story about a girl in a tree staring at the main character and then following him to the sea and the hook says I want to know why and I want to know why - but this LP doesn't really seem to have an explanation for a lot of the whys in these songs like why are you falling through the floor why are you going into a sock Figgis why are you flying into the Sun all of these weird things could only happen in a dream state or a very drug-induced haze the style of music played on this LP to me is a combination of psychedelic rock garage rock and Chewy's music as well the stilts get a lot of comparisons to the Jesus and Mary Chain and almost to a fault because I've seen a lot of people just react to this with a knee-jerk and say rip off you're going to need a lot more than Brad Hart gets deep vocals and a little bit of a wall of sound technique for me to compare you to the Jesus and Mary Chain the guitars and the drums don't even sound the same to me this LP calls out a lot more to psychobilly bands like The Cramps especially recordings like rockin and reel and in Auckland New Zealand one of my favorite live LPS of all time really interruptive vocal reverb on that thing and a nice guitar twang that shows up on this LP as well but crystal stilts are nowhere near as riled up as The Cramps their songwriting is a lot more slick and depends more on melody than eccentrics all the rudimentary drum and guitar work combined with just the key mashing piano and organ playing really reminds me of The Velvet Underground's Messier tracks from peels slowly or especially white light/white Heat a lot of tracks here to me kind of feel like snapped off bits of sister Rae reaching different levels of chaos in the verses and choruses but there's a retro feel that I'm getting from this LP to outside of the Velvet Underground something that references just psychedelic rock in general like the Jefferson Airplane and what I love about Krystal stilts is that they embody all of these ideas without simply walking down the path of just one of them the track through the floor on this thing is a freaking hit with the buzzing organ the boogie woogie piano the rocket roll guitar just swaying back and forth it kind of reminds me of a zombie themed sock hop and the track half a moon though I like it it kind of displays a fault with this LP when it moves at a pretty fast click a lot of the feelings on this thing the instrumentation whatever feels really fleeting because it just buzzes by the detail is lost in the effects but it's nothing that some repeated visits and some closed headphone listening won't fix there's some dark lows on this LP too there are real highlights for me as well the song alien rivers is this seven minutes trawling just disembodied voice calling out from another dimension and even though it's kind of creepy I kind of want to come with I think flying into the Sun is one of the best ballads of the band has ever recorded I love the way the synths and the harpsichord notes sound on the course of that song just like beautiful I could honestly go on and on and on about every track but like no ages nouns this thing like I said earlier is not going to reveal itself in one lesson but there were five tracks here that kind of hit me like a brick from the get-go like shake the shackles where what is catchy about the song is not a mystery it's right there for all to see my only other gripe about the LP is that the closing track is kind of anticlimactic but that in general to me is what sucks about dreams you never really get this sense of finish or closure the dream just kind of ends when it ends it takes psychedelic rock further down the rabbit hole crystals stilts in love with oblivion I'm feeling a strong eight to a light nine on this album enjoying it a lot loving it what do you think of this LP are you loving it are you hating it and why what do you think of crystal stills past work in comparison to this and what should I review next thank you for watching Anthony Fantana crystals stilts forever 
OwxUIz-Thwc,the weekend houses balloon hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd this is the needle drop where we blah blah blah about lalalala it's review time the weekends house of balloons I've been getting a lot of requests for this these guys are a Canadian R&B outfit and houses is their debut album slash mixtape it's free and that and some rave reviews have kind of spread it around the internet like wildfire and while this is R&B it's not really an average album in the genre I would say one of the few things kind of keeping it there are the R&B style vocals outside of that the production is pretty experimental there are samples of beach house on here Siouxsie and the Banshees a lot of weird cycling noises and hums also a lot of atmospheric reverb sleek percussion very chilly dark keyboards but there is a good amount of auto-tune here which I can't seem to escape from auto-tune is everywhere these days so in a way this LP kind of forced me to face down my auto-tune fears even though I have listened to LPS with auto-tune on it before I'm yet to review something that features this much of it and it's got me wondering could there possibly be a day where where maybe I'm enjoying auto-tune Friday because there are a lot of instances that when I hear it mixed on a record it kind of sounds like a robot with a nasal decongestant problem and I get that a little bit here but the thing is the vocalists in this group can really really sing and very well too so the auto-tune here is kind of used for effect or to just accent or just add another sound instead of being a safety net so at the end of the day I just kind of see auto-tune as a tool just depends on who's using it and in what context for me to enjoy it now back to this believe me I am all for artists taking the sound in the style of contemporary R&B and reclaiming it and doing something a little more interesting with it because for too long the genre has been saturated with so much commercial radio BS and the weekend does experiment in their own way sonically like I said with the production those weirder more left-field sounds but it's not like the production is so amazing that it's a saving grace for what I feel is like the Achilles heel of this album and that is the lyrics and by lyrics I don't mean what this album is about for the most part this thing rounds the bases on some pretty understandable topics something that we have all heard songs about or watched movies about before it's things like depression lack of self-confidence addiction sex troubled relationships and living on the edge so no I don't really have an issue with the subject matter here my issue is that I feel like these stories on this album are being told from the perspective of a reality TV show star on MTV the character on this album would fit nicely into the cast of Jersey Shore he's drug addled makes emotional mountains out of molehills he parties all night and he thinks with his Wang most of the time when you're not getting a play-by-play of really trivial drama like on the track wicked games over here you're getting all these attempts at being poetic by putting together key phrases like look into my eyes and references to hearts and scars and pain this thing basically reads like the tear-stained diary of that jerk who shows up at your friend's party with two fake diamond earrings a popped collar the shirts kind of open in the chest he weighs 90 pounds wet and he walks around just hitting on everybody's girlfriend but nobody stops him because it's funny to watch him try and believe me the depressing aesthetic of this album is not lost on me I get it it's the soundtrack to this dudes downward spiral into drugs women and money it is a sad tale but the problem is I don't sit both eyes with this guy because he's acting like a tool he talks like a tool he walks like a tool he has to like tendencies and desires he's being a tool people like the character on this album exist in real life and they deserve to have their side of things told to I'm not gonna deny that even if it is written with the tact and eloquence of a series of drunk texts at 3 a.m. I appreciate the concept here more artists should take the weekends and even Frank ocean's lead and screw with R & B I can't really see myself returning too much on this album I'm feeling like a strong three to a light four on this is that harsh well I just really have a negative feeling about it I don't enjoy it but I know that there are a lot of people out there who are what do you think of this album do you think it's amazing do you think it's a step forward for R & B or do you feel like me and maybe the lyrics kind of hold it back a little bit even though the sounds and the concept are pretty interesting and that's the review the weekend house of balloons forever [Music] 
LNB3Cy4djB4,this weather is great this weather is great Oh TV on the radio nine types of Lloyd it's review time Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd thank you for watching the needle drop where we blah blah blah about la la la almond milk again chocolate and I got some tea alright before we get into this review on the needle drop calm if you're not already there in mp3 from the new natural child LP 1971 gonna be coming out on 4/20 nice link down below alright in this episode of the needle drop we are reaching out and touching the new TV on the radio LP nine types of light this is the band's fifth album and we have to get one thing out of the way Cal what do you think of TV on the radio are you crazy I watch my TV I'm the TV not the radio stupid hence why I hate Cal Church esta and you guys keep asking for him you're sick I mean it well if that didn't get you clicking off this video maybe this next thing will I've never been a gigantic fan of TV on the radio sadly their whole discography has never really clicked with me their early stuff is really ambitious and I love that but the rough recordings the band was working with at the time I felt kept those songs from reaching their full potential and while a later release like return to cookie Mountain does have more fidelity to it some of the songs there are straightforward and I like them like the singles but there are a lot of tracks on that LP that to me are like needlessly noisy I enjoy noise I enjoy effects I enjoy additions to songs but to me they weren't adding as much as they were distracting from the very simple song structures so admittedly I kind of slept on this band and turned my back on them and then dear science came up right behind me while I wasn't looking and ran a machete across and I throw to me that album was extremely enjoyable really really passion vocals and lyrics great songwriting arrangements and personality on that LP - this thing is a slight change of direction from earlier releases and that there is a pretty prominent love song theme throughout this thing these guys have written love songs and songs about the emotion of love before but this definitely takes multiple angles within one albums timespan one track the first one that got released from this LP will do is a great example of the potential that these songs can reach really memorable straightforward Valerie very poetic lyrics and an eccentric sexiness that kind of reminds me of Prince and Killer crane is another great track the lyrics don't stand out to me on this one as much as the the blissful atmosphere and instrumentation do I love the keys I love the woodwinds matched up against these really kind of heavenly vocals and acoustic guitars it's a really nice atmosphere it's like listening to a sunset maybe more like listening to a sunrise these are the tracks that for me like the planets aligned and something great happens but that's not the case with every song they're really provocative and pretty good lyrics that are doled out like candy to a lot of these songs somehow escapes the track you which describes a pretty tense and upsetting situation in the blandest way possible new Cannonball Run has a lot of that soulful eccentric energy behind it that I said earlier kind of remind me of Prince and a lot of energy but there's really not much of a song to back it up or a hook on the track keep your heart though TV on the radio uses the falsetto vocals that make them so distinct and I like that they write themselves out of their range a lot on that track in the lows and the highs I read and I watch a lot of reviews and a lot of people I have come across complain of this magical thing called flow but I feel like this is one of the first times I'm really kind of getting it though I like tracks on this album like no future shock and caffeinated consciousness for their sheer energy and just raw delivery they kind of feel unwelcome guests for me on this album they're like my drinking buddy showing up in the middle of an intimate dinner I'm trying to have with my girlfriend this LP kind of hits me in the same way The Strokes latest album did I have a real range of feelings on these songs some of them are gonna be stuck in my head by winter some of them I feel like could have worked better on another album or with another take and others just aren't doing a lot for me regardless of how I feel about the tracks individually I'm just not really loving the album as a whole I'm feeling like a strong six to a light seven on this thing but what do you think about this are you in love with it do you hate it are you kind of on the fence with it how do you feel it compares with TV on the radio's earlier stuff and that's pretty much it the review anthony Fantana TV on the radio nine types of light thank you for watching forever you 
5_Oi7Kr46A8,it's track looking casual hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd of the needle drop and the needle drop dot-com that is a django reinhardt album behind me this is track reviews where we talk about the latest and greatest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the major label persuasion this time around and the Beastie Boys are back with a trailer for a short film that's supposed to be coming out linked down below in the D box and a new single from their forthcoming LP the hot sauce committee part 2 sadly part 1 was held back due to a diagnosis of cancer for a Beastie Boys member MCA which kind of hurt me because honestly he's my favorite Beastie Boy and though he seems to be past it now has had surgery hope he's cured hotsauce committee part 1 the release of that has been delayed indefinitely and now part 2 is going to come out without the release of part 1 which has actually changed the track listing of these albums quite a bit Wicky Wicky Wicky Wicky wikipedia has a very detailed but confusing description before I get into the review people ask me all the time Anthony Anthony please make a list of your top ten favorite albums of all time I'm sorry there's no such list it doesn't exist but I imagine people asked for this list because they want recommendations and if you want one of those The Beastie Boys Paul's Boutique teep teep teep teep make some noise hopefully from this new LP is going to save my soul even though make some noise kind of sounds like kind of sounds like The Beastie Boys should have had five songs with that title by now but let's let's listen to it with my non-existent headphones and see what it's got to offer in case you didn't know there is a link to listen to that song below linked on the rocket out blogs website good old Sammy and some kind of awesome have the hook up with this new track so stream it with them mm-hmm the first thing that hit me on this track was this hello nasty vibe like this could have been a b-side from it or something but the reason I related to that album is because this track had an extremely live and kind of electronic feel from it which I was really getting from the buzzing synthesizers and the robot vocal that was coming in on the chorus and the crowd sounds do help that live delivery but even without them this thing Wow it was like I was standing front row listening to these guys do their thing the total package comes in loud and clear but all the sounds bleed over each other really nicely and I like how the vocals sound like they're kind of rough and muffled and a little low phi2 and overall I really like the beat there is a ton of detail in it the more I listen to it the more I pick up I love the drum sounds I love the way the track builds toward the end overall I mean I can't ask for more from this instrumental but rhyme wise I don't feel like the beasties have brought their best game on an individual level at least I don't feel like they brought a lot of memorable lines a lot of funny lines or anything like that they're pretty much relying on the same imagery that got them to this place in the first place like you're right to fight from the left to the right partying making noise there are some funny references to Ted Danson fizzy lifting drinks and also MCA even goes as far as to reference how old the Beastie Boys are getting but the Beastie Boys energy here cannot be denied that needs to be discussed and understood and appreciated to their knack for tag teaming is still great they play off of each other fantastically and overall they sound excited to do this so I'm excited to hear it so ultimately I feel like my argument here is the beastie boys still have it their age to me showed a little bit on the five boroughs with the introduction of some cleaner sounds some weaker hooks but here I feel like they're showing that age is just a mental thing because to me vocally they sound the same way they did back at hello nasty I am feeling a decent seven on this track and I'm really looking forward to the freakin hot sauce committee part two what do you think do you love this do you hate this track why let me know Anthony Fantana The Beastie Boys make some noise forever you 
mKM5Z5n8Mi0,timber timber timber timber timber timber timber timber timber timber hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd it's a lazy Sunday I'm kind of tired but it's still important to review stuff and this is the new timber timber album creep on creep and on this is timber timbres fourth LP it came out this year and it's a follow-up to 2009 album which was self-titled and to me that album was great I really loved it don't know why I didn't review it man I've been saying timber timber and it's timber timber anyway timber timber is not one of those projects that has album after album of completely different sounds this is something that has been more fine-tuned a very slow evolution each LP has gotten a little better in terms of recording quality but still the love of pop and folk sounds just tasteful arrangements a very bleak eerie atmosphere all of that has remained and there's tons of piano on this album and the chords on the piano are usually played on the upper register of the instrument so instead of getting these loud booming cuts of sound these chords you get a lot of all these plinky dinky piano chords just kissed with woodwinds and string arrangements and despite all the weirdness in the lyrics it kind of gives the music a lot of innocence the tunes the style kind of reminds me of just like greasers 1950s some rockabilly as well it's a time when the music really reflected this you know very very white plain vanilla version of love but when you look into the lyrics of this LP it's anything but not every song here revolves around it but there's kind of a central theme on this album dealing with love relationships or lack thereof alright but it's not like this LP is like oh baby I love you and miss you screw that crap the infatuation that LP has um is much more psychotic much more disturbing take the opening track bad ritual for instance where basically the lyrics deal with thinking about her thinking about her with other people dealing with it in all these unhealthy ways but as the chorus says you know it's a bad ritual but it calms me down and the obsession leads to some really quiet frustration on woman and creepin creepin on and especially lonesome hunter where Taylor Kirk says to this person yes you should be very frightened of me and on the same track Kirk begs for this person to free him from the spell of this obsession but it just does not happen so he kind of turns to himself for salvation on one of the final tracks of this LP do I have power where he asks himself if he can rid himself of this problem but in the verses acknowledges that that's really not going to happen even goes as far as to say look come on just can you just let me pretend to be with you you know it'll it'll keep me happy it'll make me happy this LP kind of ends on that obsession before it just goes into a short instrumental and ends and though that seems like maybe an anti climactic ending I think that it's the best place to end it because that's where the suffering comes from this obsession will not stop so yes even though we have all heard songs and albums about love I like the fact that this displays it in such a dark vein the only other things that divert from the usual style of this album are these three spare instrumentals that kind of pop up at random on the album and though I do appreciate them they are good for what they are they really don't fit into the narrative of the album to me the more I listen to this the more I enjoy them but I kind of fail to see a linkage there are moments with woodwinds like I said strings even some sax solos as well which Colin Stetson actually plays Colin you're following me everywhere come on dude come on I think it's great something for the Scott Walker or Tom eet's fans to munch on for sure something I could see sound tracking a David Lynch film get pulled in with the catchy tunes and stay for the creep-creep-creep in timber timbres creep on creepin on feelin a light yeah light 8 on this enjoyed the hell out of it mmm Anthony fan tanto timber timber forever 
vph5xGBPCOE,the vaccines what did you expect from the vaccines hi everyone you have any Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd time for an album review almond milk power on we're doing a review of the latest LP from the latest sensation to come out of the UK The Vaccines I am totally surprised that name wasn't taken already their debut LP is titled what did you expect from the vaccine now in my last review the holy ghost album I hope you watched it if you didn't go back and do so I talked a little bit about how a lot of today's music is derivative or you know just copying another idea borrowing from somewhere else more derivative than you may think and how something being completely original doesn't necessarily make music great and something being kind of unoriginal or just really influenced by other things doesn't necessarily make an album bad and if you're a fan of the Jesus and Mary Chain The Ramones The Strokes and even Interpol chances are the vaccines are not going to pioneer any new ground in your brain but they do offer a really gutsy noisy straightforwardness that you may feel is missing from a lot of music today the opener on this LP record bar rah-rah-rah is about as to-the-point as The Ramones blitzkrieg bop all you need to do is switch out a hill let's go with rah-rah-rah and with the guitar and the vocals just soaked in atmospheric reverb this thing kind of comes off sounding like in upbeat b-side from unknown pleasures that we just never heard because you know wasn't as depressing to the rest of the album I love that that track is short and sweet just like BAM but these guys really do lay on the hooks to like if you wanna that track is basically candy for the ears lots of lyrics about rekindling a dead relationship put on a pedestal of just noisy guitars exploding with the same reverb that was on wrecking bar and pretty much every other track of this album the opening bass line on the lack of understanding really like a pixie song while the vocals had this very strokes s croon to them very sentimental singing there is definitely a bit of a borrowed feeling in the sound of this LP which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if I didn't feel like I've heard some of these chord progressions like a million times before the chords used in the Khorasan blow it up I know and you know we have heard before and also I've been reading a lot of comments on the track one of the first singles to drop from this LP post-breakup sex which some people are likening to the Orchestral Manoeuvres in the dark song and Ola gay and I've heard both tunes and yeah I agree they have a similar chord progression those guys are from the UK as well maybe they're an influence but I think going out and just calling The Vaccines a ripoff is a little bit like jumping the gun do you know how often the chord progression in that song has been used we've got an F major got a D minor and then we've got a b-flat major Hennessy major post breakup sex post breakup sex what did you expect from post breakup sex she went up wait for the holiday she said she's going to and they she never got there she never got them she never got there they say yeah baby baby baby oh yeah baby baby baby oh yeah baby baby baby oh I know I always be this chord progression has been in use in popular music long before OMG and the Ramones were even around so it's not that the music here is a ripoff it's just been around the block a little that's all and that's pretty much how I feel about many of the songs here they sound really close to what I love but they're not really what I love it's the sound and the simple and well-traveled songs and chord progressions that kind of make this thing instantly enjoyable and instantly accessible it's almost like it's too easy to like like I've been given a baseball bat and the ball was put on a tee right in front of me when I would really prefer it to be pitched to me even if I do end up you know striking out the first couple times to me it's just a fun rock record with a lot of effects but also kind of in one ear and out the other it kind of reminds me of that Best Coast LP that came out last year it might not sound that amazing now but save it until June this thing would be perfect for a road trip so I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this LP I know people freak out and they're like oh of you if you give it a six that means you hate it no I liked it while it was on it's just kind of not something I'm gonna revisit anytime soon that's all so what do you think of this LP love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next The Vaccines what did you expect from them forever 
5PSH6cV4N-I,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and something has changed I don't know if you can tell but this is my new green screen er this is my old one it's crappy it hardly works I just decided to let it bite the dust but this is the this is the green screen er 3000 the Cadillac of green screen squares it has over 3 million album covers programmed into it from all around the world in multiple languages and all I need to do is think of whatever album cover I want it just comes up awesome but right now I want to go into the new Holy Ghost LP self-titled these guys are a duo from New York their name ends with an exclamation point and last year they came out with one of my favorite EPS of 2010 static on the wire they're on DFA records and surprisingly DFA is actually 10 years old this year happy birthday 10th birthday DFA and over these 10 years DFA records has come together with a really strong reputation of just pretty um great alternative dance music and holy ghost carries on that tradition so they should definitely catch the years of anybody into that DFA records sound and the music is a nice mix of live instrumentation and electronic sequences really getting that blend of flesh and circuit board together but Holy Ghost is always kind of swinging from one end of the spectrum to the other the track Jam for Jerry is really heavy on the synthesizers really just glimmering pianos and a hi-hat bass drum snare beat it's a legit disco tune and by contrast the opener to this LP do it again is extremely electronic and extremely rigid just chock-full of lyrics about not wanting to leave the house but doing so out of sheer boredom but still finding the club scene and everything outside the house pretty boring too now the instrumentation and the production here are absolutely killer and probably the best thing this LP has going for it the drums really snap like a belt they are crunchy they stay crunchy even in milk lots of hand claps and some hand drums to looped hand drums on static on the wire nice touch there's some other nice little touches to these tracks too like the horn on slow motion the group vocals on Jam for Jerry and soul singer Michael McDonald actually does guest vocals on the closing track of this LP and I like the holy ghost has him on here the fact that they're into his music so much that they would invite him onto this LP kind of gives me an idea of where this band is mentally and stylistically but all of those great sounds and additions aside the synthesizers in the high end anyway are really what brings the most texture in the most detail sometimes you've got four to five different sounds bouncing around on one given track layering over one another and really creating a nice buffet of texture across one song and speaking of songs the next best thing this has going for it is just really strong strong songwriting but kind of what makes Holy Ghost so instantly enjoyable is that so many of the sounds so many of the ideas the lyrical concepts they're all pretty well established as having sold tons of Records in the past but I can see some listeners coming across this and saying you know what I've heard this before for me in terms of gripes I wasn't fantastically impressed with the last song in the LP I do like MacDonald's guest vocal but the melody and the groove actually kind of reminds me of the first track on the album and even though I do like the song I'm not really excited to hear static on the wire on this LP again pretty much the same version that was on the EP that came out last year and I kind of wish the eccentricity that I find on tracks like hold on and do it again bled into the other songs a little bit more because many of these tracks don't really have anything weird about them they're very glossy Dan's pop with a lot of synthesizers and disco influence still I said earlier in the review I'm a sucker for this kind of stuff it's throwback pop record that is well written and danceable feeling like a decent 8 on this thing what do you think about this LP do you love it do you hate it why why why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan oh holy ghost forever you 
05JqiVVSJSk,panda bear table boy my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd nice to see you if you've been here before and nice to meet you if this is your first time it's time for an album review I've gotten a ton of requests for this thing and I'm curious about it too panda bears tomboy Animal Collective member creator of 2007's person pitch you should already know who he is no reason to beat you over the head with back story I'd like to start with what I like about this LP because this thing is kind of like two-sided for me panda bear does pull together some really good tunes for this album for sure but because many of these tracks were released via singles before this album actually came out and there were high-quality rips on blogs all over the internet I kind of already knew which songs I was going to like and which ones I didn't you can count on me opens up the LP and kind of sets the stage for the album a lot of sounds and ideas that are carried throughout the entire LP really soaring vocals blissful effects and lots of weird noises and samples that are cycling and just kind of whizzing by so fast it's hard to catch them on even the the 10th listen to this album and a couple practices carried on from person pitch to like just mesmerizing repetition like on the track slow-motion there's a lot of repetition on that track but it's not like a performed repetition or anything like that it's like panda bears copying and pasting snippets of rhythms and even his own vocals and just cycling them over and over and over and over and over and over and this could be a good thing to some people there's a heavy Beach Boys influence on the melodic execution and the layering of the vocals on surfers him and my favorite track on this LP last night at the jetty but if you've been a fan of panda bear and animal collective that Beach Boys influence should be no shock to you by now I know this is going to lead to a lot of disagreement with you guys but what really turns me off about this LP much of the I'm are just the sounds that it is loaded with and for me the sounds here kind of range from being just underwhelming to outright bad take the track tomboy for instance I wasn't really hot on the original version it just seemed like the beat was repeating too much just really kind of muddy guitar to me but now I'm even less hot on the album version now that it features a very clumsy and badly mixed keyboard hissing all over the top of it in terms of melody on that title track there's just not a lot going on after you've gone through the first minute of the track you've pretty much heard everything melodically the song is going to do what a tomboy does to distract from this is just load itself with so many effects that it's a difficult song to pull apart and that's not necessarily a bad thing there are plenty of LPS out there that function more on sound than they do song to get themselves by and keep things interesting but for me and this is only my opinion that doesn't really happen here many of the sounds especially the vocals on this LP are just slathered in this really cheap high gloss delay that bounces all over everything in the mix and I'm just not a big fan of it it's kind of like you're hearing somebody sing by themselves and Superman's fortress of solitude or something I mean the delay isn't terrible it gets the job done but should it be so loud and distracting and pronounced that it's pretty much the focal point of the album I don't think so it's not that fantastic of an effect to me person pitch in comparison to this had a much more reasonable amount of studio trickery going on outside of the effects tracks like take pills and Broz were pretty good songs I like the eighth track here because it's quiet there's breathing room for my ears panda bear kind of just lets the sound speak for themselves and I like that Alsatian darn just like the track afterburner though they end up just as messy and cacophonous as all the other tracks they start off a little bit quieter so there is some kind of progression going on there but for everything I like here it seems to be easy for me to find something that I don't speaking of drones the track drone to me the sound of the keyboards on that thing I absolutely can't stand it's like a test of the emergency broadcast system and the constant tremolo effects on the vocals and friendship bracelet to me just adds nothing to the track and doesn't interest me at all why I'm really confused as to why they were added but still there's something to be said about the intention of this LP panda bear even though I don't like the sounds on many of the tracks I'm not a big fan of all the effects choices and the way this thing was mixed it's intentionally done this way obviously if it wasn't the entire LP wouldn't have such a cohesive sound many of the tracks kind of come together like these psychedelic motifs of effects that maybe you're just supposed to zone out to or dance to in a frenzy of ecstasy and there's music that definitely makes me feel that way it's just not necessarily going to be this album I'm not happy to say that you're not happy to hear that but if I'm going to be taken seriously I have to be honest and I'm feeling like a strong for to a light five on this album no it's not I'm not mad I just wish you would put forth an argument or something as opposed to just meaning me to death I actually liked the King of Limbs okay it just wasn't that amazing to me I liked it more than this but you're just exaggerating the score you really make me want to quit reviewing forever oh sure 
bRPT-bxzQxw,trap it darker hand-ground hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd welcome to the needle drop where we blah blah blah about la la la doing a review of this new trapped MLP darker handcraft before we get into that link down there in the description bar of this video are links to a new song from Fleet Foxes music video with that really diggin on that and also a review of the latest single from singer-songwriter Blake Mills it actually comes off of his uh LP that he released last year but it's a new single on analog edition records forged by a blog that I like a lot called everybody taste check it out trap them as New Hampshire metal band this is their third LP produced by Kurt Balu of converge whose albums I end up reviewing all the time all pigs must die nails feller talk I really can't help it he just keeps turning up places with bands that I want to talk about now Kurt has been producing this band stuff up until this point so the sonic differences between trap Dems earlier albums and this new LP are very slight but they are here if there's any noticeable change its that the volume and that the distortion this that thick guitar sound has gotten even heavier than before this thing has the speed the guts the fists to face straightforwardness of punk music but also depends heavily on heaviness and the grooves of metal and hardcore music these guys are definitely indebted to converge doom Black Flag and entombed who I actually think they sound the most like so if those comparisons don't catch your eye maybe the fact that this LP is just raging everywhere will and that is attention-grabbing but the thing is that stuff only really kind of goes so far before it gets old for me anyway trap them does definitely take this anger and fuse it with and back it up with some pretty good riffs breakdowns musicianship and hooks and yes I said hooks because choruses are courses no matter how loud you play them parts of this LP like the lyrics on the facts or that opening wailing guitar lead on every walk a quarantine these kind of just like branded themselves in the back of my skull the moment I heard them this band can be pretty diverse and how they structure their tracks too they do everything well from packing everything into a 58 second blast to stringing things out past four minutes really do put themselves in danger of wearing things thin but still remain pretty engaging for me a lot of tracks here do really have their own direction like sordid earnings is this big loud strung out booming instrumental sovereign through the pines has this really interesting blast be in three four that opens up the traffic I think the facts has a tambourine somewhere in the background there I'm not sure just some things I think I'm hearing here and also drag the wounds eternal is this just brooding dark melodic torturous scream with I think some organs buried in there somewhere not human organs like in organ depending on your taste all of these differences can seem like they're not that important because they're mostly delivered with the same aesthetic I'm kind of torn because there's part of me thinking to myself I really do love being perplexed by a record a little bit sitting back and thinking mmm you know the effects on the new pad they're Shiraz psychedelic mind-bending really but there's also a part of me that sees this LP is not really being up here but being more in here because when I hear those D beats rollin when I hear those chugging power chords I just want to break something so those who are completely devoid of testosterone in their system I might recommend that you steer clear but if you're not huge on variety and you're really looking for something that is going to kick you in the stomach something that is loud proud simple with a lot of strong musicianship really great drum fills by the way I am so happy the drums on this album are performed so well please keep real actual drum sounds alive I hate triggers good musicianship decent songs and riffs if you're interested get on this links to listen below I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing I enjoyed it a lot very liked anything I'm not interested in another obscure mid what how come you don't review any popular music that I want to hear about mousetrap is not a good band if they were good they'd be number one of the charts shut up hey Anthony fan tanto trapped them darker handcraft forever 
p1TcklAM0r4,it's track review hey everybody yeah yeah yeah Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd thank you for coming on in clicking on this video whether you're subscribed or not and watching this episode of track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion somebody asked me recently where's couch couch esta where is he how come he's not in your videos he's right there I like music he's not going anywhere you know he's here he's here doesn't need to be in every video I hate that guy let's talk about this right here a new track recently dropped from the Japanese rock band Boris this is their upcoming LP heavy rocks many of you may know in 2002 Boris also released an album titled heavy rocks that's confusing and from what I've read the band is doing this because they're looking to redefine heavy at least for themselves anyway and also look out for other albums from these guys because they've recently released with MERS now and they have two LPs new album and attention please that have come out but they do share some tracks those two LPs they have popular songs on them I think they're just two sides of the same coin okay so heavy rocks is going to be coming out on May 24th should be out on Sargent House Records let's take a listen to the first track to drop from it linked down below this video riot sugar you know when I heard about this announcement of heavy rocks kind of the the sequel to that original album I got really worried because the thing is Boris is such a heavy band and I heard tracks off of new album and attention please and those tracks go in a much poppier much more straightforward much more friendly direction and it seems a lot of people are accepting that and that's fine Boris sounding nicer I'm completely done with that I wish more bands felt as free as Boris to take their music in a completely different different direction and just do whatever the fuck they want but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to be in love with it Boris to me is best when being enjoyed as a noise band a drone band a metal band and that's what they're doing here Boris is basically standing right on top of the sacrificial slab and they're microwaving CDs of less heavy music in mass and just throwing them all over the place and this of course brings it out the spirit of the guitar God ripheus Maximus who lays down some Italy melee licks all over the track line the song opens with a pretty rough guitar and it just has this this classic tube amplifier sound to it not too much low-end on the guitar but when the drums and the bass come in that's when you get a force shoved in your face from all sonic frequencies there's some decent Rumble in there some wailing leads just Banshee style guitar solos and I really love the sound of the smooth vocals that come in when the first verse starts the band hits a great groove and they're always changing it up there are some heavy heavy booms that you know just like letting a guitar know ring out at a couple points in the song just kind of changing things up and there's like this weird guy vocal that comes in in the background a couple times like dirt dirt it kind of reminds me of like Danzig everything is turned up to 11 and it keeps that modern heavy heavy doom sound but while also you know paying homage to that bluesy aesthetic that metal from the 70s used to have I'm loving the track but honestly I I think I know and anybody who is an extreme fan of Boris knows this is not the heaviest that they've been on this song there are tracks off of the original heavy rocks like heavy friends for instance which has much more Rumble than this song riot sugar could have been heavier but then again if it was much more bassy I think that would have distracted from the fact that you know what we do have a good song here I'm feeling a light eight on this track and I'm really looking forward to heavy rocks what do you guys think of this track are you loving it hating it why do you think this is going to be a new beginning maybe a new Zenith for Boris or maybe this you know their heyday is over and what should I review next anthony Fantana boris heavy rocks ride sugar forever 
RG3E7xK6Oq4,hey uh sorry it's dark out but uh but sometimes they don't have the time to shoot during the day a Big KRIT returner forever hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd a and Big KRIT is a Mississippi rapper Meridian Mississippi rapper and this is his latest mixtape free album thing and he's been getting a lot of attention on the blogosphere and also from XXL who made him a freshmen of 2011 just because of his last LP crib was here even though this guy's been getting attention from Island and Def Jam he's still functioning in the medium that got him where he is today and that's the free album that's the free mixtape on return of forever but then this thing breaks a lot of the stereotypes people have with southern rap that it's just club music that it's not lyrical that the rapper's rap to slow that it's filled with pointless pointless violence that's just thrown in there for shock value between the 20 tracks on this LP crit has a lot to say on a lot of subjects I knew I was listening to something special something interesting when the introduction track kind of features crit holding this meeting of people where he's going to talk about his music his art return to forever just the the movement he's trying to create I guess and all of a sudden he just breaks into a rap about the adrenaline rush being onstage being in front of a crowd of people set against just rising keyboards and swelling horns and as the song gets more and more epic it's just suddenly interrupted by an alarm clock and he's waking up and his roommate or friend or whatever is banging on the door in the wall screaming turn that off turn that so so so even though Crip feels like he's gotten this amount of popularity he still sees that he's kind of got far to go these tracks highlight not only his personal struggle with his work but also his fight to stay true to what he feels he is to what he feels good music is while getting more popular instead of trying to give in to the pitfalls of image and chains and money and just using all this flash to get people listening and that elevated conscious kind of bleeds into the other tracks on this album like a track that kind of puts in a painting the dog-eat-dog world of growing up poor lions and lambs so Big KRIT does bring a pretty serious flavor to much of this LP which does break a stereotype with southern rap albums but the thing is it's still a southern rap album it's high-energy at a lot of points and there are some party songs on here about girls about cars relationships and people like consistency I don't blame them I like consistency too but don't freak out and lump the guy into a pile with all these other rappers you hate just because he makes a song about a car what you say is important yeah but how you say it is important to whether crit is going out for a ride or disturbing the peace with his subwoofers he's more lyrical than most rappers are who were talking about that stuff in rotation he kind of talks about how his cars like this personal getaway place for him and on time machine he talks about how a car can be kind of like a nostalgic place for him where he remembers listening to Scarface on the tape deck being with his father and wearing a starter jacket I mean overall Kurt is really great at pulling songs together and he raps really well he keeps his flow kind of simple on the more party oriented tracks but when he's really trying to put meaning into his song he'll change it up now the production on here crit produce this thing himself which to me makes him a goddamn double threat uh the beats on here are fantastic not really the vinyl crackle soul samples that I love hearing from ad-lib and guys like that it's more like smooth funk and soul a very clean sound and on a lot of tracks though I have complained about this before on other rap albums there are R&B vocals here yeah but they're not the really clean gussied up pretty up R&B vocal that you'll hear on your local commercial rap station these are the really in your face eccentric Rd vocals that Outkast used to have on their best stuff and having mentioned Outkast there are some pretty big outcasts references on this LP forever ever so as far as the beats go there are some lifted things on this LP whether they be vocal samples or horn hits or piano parts something like that but crit adds a lot of synthesized instrumentation to the mix - and he mixes it so well it's kind of hard to tell where the original instrumentation starts and the samples end and though I am a sucker for those boom bap drums I'm not a big fan of drum machines that beats on this thing sound great I got to give it up and crit is really great at using his music to create moods - like on dreaming which is like really stark really bare with a solemn vocal sample of guitar and very simple drums and sometimes he goes really lush like I'm Sookie now the album kind of ends on a quiet note with crit wondering if he's ever going to carve out a niche for himself in rap music but as long as he keeps this level-headed attitude that to me makes this album great and he keeps making music like this I do not doubt for a second that that will happen I'm giving it a decent 9 loving the hell out of it highly recommend it to anybody who's into hip-hop if you want to try something that is outside of your comfort zone and you're not into hip-hop my complaints about this LP are very few and far between maybe some of the guest singers kind of overtake the song a little bit distract from the vocals just a smidge and also I'm not sure if I'm digging the mouth choo-choo train sounds on Amtrak you know the beats good rhymes are good but still chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga outside of that great personality coming from crit good raps good flow consistency in terms of quality plus the features on here don't overtake the album and the ones that are on these tracks are great millionaire kills it on one of the tracks and also Big KRIT has one of mentors David Banner from the southern rap group cricket lettuce which wasn't around too long just one album from when I believe but still he's on the LP to great job it's just southern energy southern attitude southern swagger without the southern BS and that's why I'm liking this so much okay I'm recommending it recommending and recommending it recommending it Big KRIT return of forever forever [Music] 
TOtTxtBWZ5k,it's Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd doing another album review Bibby OHS mind okay an album title photography nerds can unite under this is video six the LP although I don't know if I would call the Apple and the tooth it's own album it's more of a remix album but whatever Bibby o is an English music producer and I got introduced to this album through a music video like many of you did for the song excuses and to me that song alone was a huge improvement upon what vivió was doing on 2009's ambivalence Avenue and also uh you know a squeak past the several tracks there's several original tracks that were on the LP that followed it weight better production brighter clearer lower sounds as well the beat alone has this eerie broken grimy quality to it with all these glitches and squawks just buzzing around it like flies it was the first time I really loved this guy's vocals to the weird distant effects on it made it kind of sound like a a robot a lonely robot on his last ounce of battery life singing his final words at the bottom of a well and the final sonic explosion in that track is fantastic - just really colorful and yet also really dark kind of like ambivalence Avenue bibby OHS tune is still all about changing his tune but he's not really revisiting the off-kilter hip-hop sounds or the or the funky instrumentation that his past LPS were loaded with all that much video has taken this opportunity to shoot for a lot of different sounds that he never has before so this LP is definitely for people who think that variety is the spice of life yeah excuses is this experimental electronica song with this burst of sound but the track right after pretentious is this slow jam with a really off-kilter rhythm and and dissonant strange acoustic screaming behind it anything new is this hard-hitting banger with these little tiny plinking notes just carrying away in the background kind of sounds like a combination of a marching band and an honest-to-god dancefloor banger and the track closes out with this nostalgic sax and Wawa solo but the beat repetitive beat does kind of eat away at my soul a little bit the nostalgia continues on light sleep which is this funk soul hybrid and also take off your shirt which is this hefty piece of cowbell rock and at this point I was kind of wondering if I was listening to the same artist that I was at the beginning of this album because Bibby o is really great at pulling a lot of different sounds and ideas and styles together onto one LP and making them all sound so different from one another that nothing really connects all of them other than the fact that they're all on this LP so the dynamics are kind of this album's biggest asset just the sounds the production the amount of colors throughout this album are great but the songs behind all of this stuff are kind of a different story for me there are some melodies here that just don't do it for me like feminine eye or more excuses and in the case of take off your shirt or some other tracks to the style that vivió goes for or you know is trying to encapsulate or just recreate kind of ends up sounding like a generic rehashed version of the original as Noah's Noah smells like life sleep for instance the solos the synthesizers on that track there are a lot of synthesizer solos on this album that are like that and yeah not many songs produced today sound like light sleep that old funk soul combination but that doesn't mean that this song is necessarily a fresh take on that old idea now if your production nut I would definitely get down with this LP because no doubt Bibby o worked like hell to make some of these tracks sound like authentic representations of the idea he was trying to embrace but to me most of these tracks don't function past their aesthetics sadly if I had reviewed the album after listening to this thing once I would have been much more positive but listening to this thing again and again and again I started to see that past the style there wasn't much to fall in love with I don't want to feel that way but I did I'm feeling like a strong five on this thing it is fun to listen through this thing and see all the ground video covers but I have a difficult time coming up with reasons to revisit I guess what do you think of the LP do you love it do you hate it why do you think it's the strongest thing Bibby o has produced and also what should I review next anthony Fantana Bibby o mine boca hope i pronounce that correct Fred you 
p5cXB3JA9Eg,it's track review normally I would put up a different album cover there but I just that seeing that on my wall just gives me good vibes so it's just it's it's there again hi everyone Anthony Fantana you're the Internet's busiest music nerd and this is track reviews where we talk about the latest and greatest and rock pop electronic and experimental music of the major label persuasion this time around with the new justice single civilization which is going to be dropping officially on April 4th and this track should be leading up to an album justice says they're working on an album Justice of course is a French electro duo I shouldn't need to explain who they are if you don't know who they are go on Wikipedia and stop thanks before we get into the review I want to tell you first Mississippi rapper Big KRIT has come out with his new album slash mixtape return a forever downloaded link in the D box I'm gonna review it soon downloaded okay and also a review of the title track from the new weekend album everybody was asking me about that curious people curious people review go listen to it it's an audio review all right Justice civilization listen to a link to to l-listen listen to link link to listen down there below let's uh do this thing all right so right out of the gate this thing is on the dance floor buzzing and whizzing and distorting and phasing with these long drawn-out bursts of this banging percussion that reminds me of rock drums and synthesizers the tones of this track in particular really kind of reminds me of like a a rock song like a 70s rock song or a metal song or something the hi-hat the very quiet hi-hat in the background which doesn't really seem to be all that necessary but it is there kind of makes me feel like this song is Electro's answer to Black Sabbath's war pigs it's kind of an epic introduction maybe too long for somebody who was expecting justice to get right into the dance beat but these guys have always been about you know setting the stage for something big and in the lyrics talked of a million drums a million guns martyring a million Suns I think they're saying martyr I think they are and this thing sounds like there is supposed to be rather like the dance soundtrack to civilization itself I feel like the lyrics have this implied epicness to them that isn't actually there it's surely great to hear from justice again but if this track was shooting for some kind of great gargantuan size then it's to me fallen just short of many tracks on cross and even most of plena sphere which had a lot more going on in terms of sounds and effects and progression I'm digging the groove I'm digging the hook but to me this track is the sound of Justice doing the same exact thing they did on cross just with a different hook and different vocals if that's what you've been waiting for them to do for four years then awesome I mean even the breakdown a third of the way into the song with the piano and the build up that kind of makes it sound like a rock opera and then it just goes into the same beats and lyrics that you heard at the beginning of the song even that was you know kind of to be expected I know it sounds shallow but to me it just feels kind of boring to hear justice tread the same water again on this thing boredom is just a fact of life it happens so what most likely you are becoming bored by this review so I will wrap it up and just say that I'm feeling like a strong five to a light six on this song really kind of on the fence with it it was likable and I could see people liking it more than me but there's just nothing in terms of thrill or excitement here I mean honestly at this point I'm really not all that stoked for the album when it comes out what do you think of this track what do you think of the adidas ad campaign attached to it what do you think justice will give us on this forthcoming LP and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana justice civilization forever 
DYEbtRPKnmw,crap spells idle labour bama lam hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd feeling good today feeling a little tired but still feeling like the needle drop is doing well because you guys are watching and commenting and supporting and making me feel awesome if it's review time the album is idle labour the band is craft spells this is their debut LP so there's not a ton of back story to report on this thing as a project nowadays underground music is so entrenched in revivalism it's kind of difficult to tell what is new and what is old and I'm starting to get to a point where I don't care anymore as long as I can separate the artists from the people they or he or she are is influenced by then I don't have a problem the decade this LP falls into for me is the 80s it's the kind of lovesick drum machine and synthesizer pop that people most associate with new one imagine if you will if new order had been able to maintain that darker Messier atmosphere they had on movement or they even had when they were still Joy Division but were able to take that sound and maintain it up until the point when they started creating the really really catchy instantaneous material they were writing on power corruption in lives I think the flowers here are more than a coincidence to idle labor is a bedroom record and I'm sure a lot of reviews will attribute the retro sound on this LP to that but seriously people send me their bedroom recorded music all the time and most of it does not sound like this the instrumentation pretty much everything is very much on tempo not a lot of audible production flaws or anything like that very plain guitar strumming lead guitars and synthesized that just Sparkle with delay and reverb very crisp thin brittle drums that don't have a lot of punch to them and Tom fills that kind of remind me of Phil Collins in the air tonight but in a good way I actually do like that song so there are all these elements of new waves stirred about this album but there is something very 2011 about it i downplayed this at the beginning of the review but the self recorded feel of this LP does have a noticeable impact on the way this album sounds for sure plus this thing has been put out on captured tracks other artists on this label include minx wild nothing blank dogs the beats it's just home to a lot of music that finds power in muddy lo-fi recording qualities in the past I found a lot of the vocals on the album's that get released on captured tracks to be mixed a little low difficult to hear on much of the songs my point is the vocals though I'm not completely satisfied with where they are in the mix the sound is completely intentional not going to say it's not and it does give craft spells of style the whole thing kind of comes off like a mixtape of my favorite New Wave songs and I take this cassette and I played it a thousand times over and then I forget about it I throw it in some box somewhere and then I stumble upon it like 10 years later and then I go and I play it on the cassette deck and it sounds beautifully warped and mangled from years of being fast forward and rewind in a crappy boom box that I got a Radio Shack it's just like pop music from another time but it's wonderfully mutated into something weirder a lot of the songwriting on this thing is pretty catchy too though the sound did not come out and grab me at first the explosion of guitar bass and dance beats on tracks like after the moment and from the morning heat just kind of kept me coming back for more again and again and again and just like getting the LP another chance just seeing if I would come to like it more and I did while there are some tracks here that do hit like a brick a good amount of them do require a little extra attention to hear the detail and even see the song for what it is I'm loving it a little bit feeling a light eight on this LP very enjoyable very jingle-jangle very poppy dig on it let me know in the comments what you think are you loving this thing are you hating it why Anthony Fantana Kraft spells I had a laborer what does Cal think of this album Cal all that witchcraft is a no-no in my book and that's why I hate Cal Church esta forever you 
JKqAHPICR60,my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's purest music nerd about to do a review and feeling like things have come full circle right now because one of the first albums I ever reviewed on this channel was the debut LP from the pains of Being Pure at heart and now I'm reviewing another LP from the pains of Being Pure at heart heart heart and I remember when I came out with that first video the someone from the band sent me a message of encouragement thanking me for making the videos and doing a great job and how they really loved what I did if you want to blame the needle drop on anybody blame it on them it's their fault before I get into this review there are links down there in the description bar new songs from Big KRIT and also mono/poly as well those both come from releases I'm really looking forward to I think those are going to be great ok so I like many people fell in love with this New York band with their self-titled debut the thin air evo khals and the really harsh distorted brittle guitars and the strong pop hooks for a lot of people were like eh a new sound like this new beginning but for people who are kind of in the know the influences for this LP were very very very obvious like tween music from another sunny day shoegaze from My Bloody Valentine early Slumberland acts like rocket ship and black tambourine as well and now we've got belong but the thing is the panes have evolved a lot between there and here with an EP and some singles like harden your heart Bart Bart break say no to love higher than the stars and with each release that they would put out the sound their sound would just just get sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and more and more produced really kind of kicking the noisier elements of their music out the window and the result is now belong being a slicker slicker version of what these guys used to be if this debut over here was the band's bleach belong is definitely their nevermind and to me that sucks a little bit because the noise the harsh distortion to me that was kind of the sour to match this band's sweetness it just kind of made listening to this an interesting experience because you were getting these two elements that didn't usually meet on a piece of music like for example I'm pretty sure we can all agree that the song belong has a lot of distortion on it but it's pretty clear that it's a tamer version of the way things used to be so in my initial reaction to this album I'm sitting here listening to it and saying mmm this is too sweet this is too poppy I don't want this get away from me but I could not leave well enough alone because the thing is I have to listen to an album over and over and over until I figured out why I don't like it I couldn't have simply just come up here and said it's less experimental I don't like it so now every time that I've listened to it those things that I remember from the band's older stuff the short instrumental stop two thirds of the way into the song this aura of cute that just surrounds the band urgent drumming the same vocal themes the same kind of keyboards all these things started melting my heart a little bit I guess and I was getting into the the blissful sound of this album the youthful really youthful sound of this album this thing is basically like tilting your head toward the sky and just dancing in the Sun for an hour there are a few moments where the pain step outside of their comfort zone a little like on the body which to me sounds a lot like a track off of New Order's lowlife but outside of them it's just one heavenly wall of sound after another even though some of the guitar sounds here you can definitely link to albums that flood has produced way back when the cat6 stick that the panes used to indulge in is melting away and they're growing into a sound that I feel like they can start calling their own I'm feeling a light eight on this thing though originally it wouldn't have on that score if I just you know did a review based on my initial reaction of this LP and I'm gonna say this is not for everybody if you're looking for something that is going to bend your mind and challenge a few pieces of your cerebral cortex then this is not it this is just sugar sugar sugar sugar sugar it's a nice friendly album for nice friendly people anthony Fantana the pains of being pure heart belong forever 
d5o1V3lxGH0,oh yeah it's snowing again and I hate everything it really takes me off I was in Texas it was 80 every day hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd back from South by Southwest ready to do a review get back to what makes this channel good get back to what the point of this channel is reviewing stuff and also this Cal hey the strokes the strikes the strokes the straps the strokes the Stroup's the strokes stamps I hate kouchi chest time to review this new strokes LP angles this is the band's fourth album and it's been 10 years since they originally dropped that debut LP that rocked my world when it came out is this it so in a way I kind of came of age and matured using that word loosely to this bands music I was really excited when I heard that album I was excited through room on fire too but I kind of fell off the wagon with first impressions of Earth and the band kind of fell off the wagon when that LP came out too with a sort of self-imposed hiatus that everybody thought would never end especially since a lot of solo stuff was coming out around this time - for those of you who may have been bothered by the change in sound that The Strokes were going for on first impressions maybe this LP won't sit well with you either because this does walk further down the road of change but it's not like this thing is one unified different direction for The Strokes there are a lot of different sounds on here that are kind of new to the band it's kind of like a two-faced record or a three-phased record there are moments on here like under cover of darkness that feel like classic tracks from the band but with a little added for just effort like just ambitious more experimental guitar leads background vocals maybe just a touch a touch of synthesizer but there are some moments here that sound like they could have been b-sides from Julian Casablanca solo album from a couple years ago and I say that because the same synthesizers and drum machines that turned up on that LP kind of show up here - in places you're so right as an example the second track the band released from the album it's not a bad song it didn't really hit me as a terrible tune at first like it did with a lot of people I didn't have a strong reaction to it I thought it was cool the band was going for a different sound but the thing is the more I chewed it over the more the track kind of lost flavor for me and I saw that though the sound is kind of interesting it doesn't really have all that much finesse to it or subtlety the band fiddles with other sounds - like on two kinds of happiness where they screw with the gate on the drums they do a lot of downstroke guitars it kind of sounds like a new wave hit Huey Lewis and the news could have written but it's not like every experiment that these guys do on this LP is a bad one I do like the bossa nova guitars on call me back even though that song never really explodes or swells there's some pretty eerie moments in there that I like a lot and I love love the classic rock guitars on gratis faction that track to me sounds like something Thin Lizzy or big star could have done roll roll and where the upstroke guitars and the bongos on Machu Picchu came from is anybody's guess still a good song though now even though Julian's voice and the ultra melodic guitar playing make this feel like a Strokes album it is kind of a jarring listening experience to visit through this thing from beginning to end because the band indulges and so many different styles and sounds that they did not pioneer it's just kind of a little indulgent of them to go back to the 80s take a sound from there go back to the 70s take a sound from there even as I listen to this thing over and over and over and over over over I don't feel like on some tracks here I'm really listening to a song but more like an idea or just a sound or a style but still despite all my complaints Angles has thrown a good deal of awesome tunes into my lap Machu Picchu gratis faction metabolism under cover of darkness taken for a fool overall it's a very likeable album it's kind of scatterbrained but still I would take this thing over that any day so I'm feeling a s strong six to a light seven on this I'm not amazed by it but enjoyed it okay tell me what you think about this LP in the comments all The Strokes fans who wanted me to review it are you loving it are you hating it why and what do you think the strokes are going to do on their next LP because there's already talk of them working on more material anthony Fantana The Strokes angles what should I review next forever [Music] 
iC7a1-RLiCo,but but above up baba shaved totally shaved clean shaven face feels good hi everyone Anthony Tenno here the Internet's busiest music remember back from my trip with a farmer's tan from south by southwest austin texas austin great city i love you you're fantastic stay the way you are stay the same you're great you're so good I want to thank the people at South by Southwest for having the rocket out blog consequence of sound and myself on the video panel that we were on when we came down that was fantastic and oh yeah it's a little uh UK paper that you guys may have heard of like you know once or twice here you know whatever called The Guardian wrote about our panel huh that's linked down there in the description bar and also while I was down there I met a lot of needle drops that was fantastic people stop me on the street and we're taking pictures with me and shaking hands and asking questions and being cool thank you to everyone who said hello every one of you ma and before I went down you guys may know that I wrote out a list of 15 bands I definitely wanted to see while i was there and i kind of failed at that you're just giving so many options and it's like you know trying to plan out your dinner before you know it's you've actually looked at the menu you know and the thing is like you know there are lists and things listed on the internet but when you're there you're there and i didn't actually end up seeing Ferguson Geronimo or weed eater orca valor talk or dass racist or immortal technique or blue because i suck but i did see off twice twice but still all together i saw like over 30 acts in the span of four days which is pretty crazy and I did bring my camera to most of the shows but i will say my first day I didn't bring my camera out I didn't know what the situation but the show's would be if they would allow cameras but in fact they did so I don't have footage of anamanaguchi telekinesis beat connection colin stetson off bad brains or sharon van etten who i saw all my first day and on my second day I didn't get any of the night shots just because I was far away from a lot of the artists who I was trying to shoot and also I was in a lot of dark venues so I don't have any video of the strokes twin shadow Agalloch or owen pallett though I did see all of them and you know it just watch my vlogs if you want to know how I feel about their shows but for the most part let's play what I did shoot as i narrate over it with no sound because i might get in trouble with youtube if somebody else's music is in my video so i decided to start my day off with a healthy dose of california's superhumanoids they were fantastic in person that camera was in front of me a lot of the time if you go to South by Southwest expect a lot of cameras to be between you and the stage now Thursday was actually st. Patrick's Day as well so a lot of the sets that day were running pretty late and I went to go see braids who you see here but when they were supposed to be 20 minutes into their set they were sort of doing sound check so the way did catch one song I had to kind of leave their set early unfortunately but still good life here is a sweet band of country bumpkins that I just kind of walked in on I heard them playing from the outside of shakespeare's pub in austin and i'm not sure what their name is but i'm pretty sure you could look him up on that record label that's right behind their heads it's on the banner this was the insane line to get into the NPR showcase to go see wild flag and unfortunately I am far too pasty and white to want to stand in the Sun for two hours to go see them though I'm sure they were great uh this is a garage rock band by the name of dead gays who killed it at the jackalope I picked up a 7-inch of theirs now keep in mind this is still st. Patrick's Day the showcases are running late natural child was supposed to play at this time I thought I missed them after I saw these guys nobody could tell me what the lineup was so I ended up leaving missing natural child but still these guys were awesome had a ton of energy and just were sweating all over the place crusty acoustic folk punk on the street yes death metal and pizza under one roof what more could you ask for the rural alberta advantage duh they have way more energy in person than they do on record their lead singer nils there were a couple tracks where I thought he was going to like freaking bust a vein in his head I started off my next day of South by Southwest with gentleman jesse and his men every single time to dude singing the same Mike an angel gets its wings here is Toro y Moi playing with his band yes awesome to see Chazz fronting some dudes they weren't the most animated group live but she has a much better singer in person than he was on his new record just really soulful enthusiastic at some points but I did end up leaving to see glasser who I have seen once but now that I've seen them twice my life is complete even though the set ended kind of early because the Sun that you see beating down on the tent was beating down on the laptop that they were playing off of and everything started buzzing and freaking and malfunctioning and then after that Kurt Vile came on and he and the violators played there psychedelic brand of slacker pop rock that I really need to get around to listening on his new album because they were really good live really reminded me of the velvet underground or crystal stilts or something like that really dug it and then that showcase finished off with aside from Bad Brains what was probably my favorite show their deer hunter never seen these guys live before and though I'm sure all of you know their most recent records are pretty catchy pretty immediate pretty instantaneous but live they are such a noise band they are such a punk band just playing louder more strung out versions of the songs that you know we all love from their records man I love the textures that they were coming out with bradford cox was freaking out live and fiddling with his amp and using a lot of feedback and putting all these loops on his vocals it was just sonic abuse and I was loving every second of it after that it was five o'clock that day a lot of the day showcases were ending the clubs were opening I saw times new viking play over at the merge showcase and they were really fun in person nice to see that they are not loaf I when they are in front of you and then I went to emo's to see liturgy who was holy crap they were loud live and their drummer is a beast a freakin beast then after liturgy I ran down to the luster pearl to go see the black lips but I came early just in time to see the group who will win the award for the most members on stage at the same time and the most members on stage with sunglasses at the same time gangs they had a bunch of people singing they had a bunch of people playing they had a bunch of people singing they had to keyboard players a bunch of guitarists a saxophone player two bassists a drummer even this guy played the cigarette and the water bottle and sometimes he bent over to touch a laptop even har mar superstar came out on stage to play that awesome George Michael cover the band came out with last year then black lips came on and there was a mosh pit and we got mooned and they play doh Katrina and they play bad kids and all the songs that i love but even though I love black lips I gotta say my favorite performance that night had to be little dragon they were great the drummer was fantastic they played a couple new tracks they played old favorites it was just a lot of dance beats a lot of good grooves a lot of great sounds and just a great aura coming off the whole band that could not be fully explained using the English language you had to be there the next afternoon South by Southwest I started off with psychedelic linear jams from woodsmen they were good live why they even had two drummers then I was bumming around until my next show and then I just was walking down the road Sobchak jittery then I was bumming around until my next show and I saw that trick trick was playing at barbarella just walked in said hey let's go see him and they were really great live they played a prince cover they were really energetic there was a couch in front of the stage for some reason Nick offers started jumping on and freaking out he dived into the crowd a couple times to they were great then I went down to a showcase sami from the rocket out blog was co-sponsoring and i wanted to see a place to bury strangers and all rumors of them being loud as hell in person confirmed and all rumors of them throwing their guitars around confirmed I'm pretty sure you don't even need to hear this this is as noisy as it looks then I walked out of a place to bury strangers playing and I heard off playing down the road I ran down there and I did not get any footage of them because I was in the mosh pit but lo and behold uh I ended up seeing trick trick twice there you go they were that good the first time I met up with this cool dude who was a friend of a friend his name is Ahmad and he got me backstage VIP at that show using his magic powers I have no clue where he gets them from but I ended up seeing the dead milkmen side stage and odd future played after the dead milkmen but for some reason they were not letting us side stage to watch odd future but people could see side stage for the other bands I don't know why that was but because I couldn't see odd future I ended up leaving to go see dominique young unique who's a great emcee a lot of personality a lot of guts got a copy of a mixtape she was really entertaining I ended up making it down to the Billboard hip hop showcase on the last day of South by Southwest I saw big krit play a full band came out behind him eventually in the set though I wasn't a huge fan of this guy's record he was great in person a lot of energy and he really knew how to kind of finesse the crowd it was great and here is the last performance I saw at South by Southwest the infamous Odd Future playing the infamous show at the infamous billboard showcase where they just kind of walked out on stage Tyler told everybody in the back that they suck and he kind of gave the sound guy a piece of his mind to his Twitter account does say stuff that he was sort of irked by the club worked by the security but still he didn't really communicate that to the crowd so when Odd Future left the stage everybody was really confused as to why people started chanting Wolfgang hoping they would come back out but once that didn't happen there was a lot of booing and unhappiness especially considering some people probably paid 20 bucks to get into that show just to see odd future so yeah those are all the clips those are the bands that I saw and yeah there there you go thanks for watching reviews soon very soon starting back into the reviews got to get back into what this channel is all about okay South by Southwest had a great time hope to see more people there next year hope to be there next year forever you 
4TUXmOZYNgA,hey everybody Anthony Fantana here the internets busiest music nerd not a car vlog today the car is actually over there that that red Pontiac but it's daytime so I don't need to do this in the car doing this outside um right now it is a sunday not much going on and Austin today so I'm not going to be down there going to be recovering from my many sleepless nights of going south by southwest by eating some healthy food and sleeping catching up on my sleep but still I want to sort of catch you guys up on what happened to me for the past two days in austin texas who i saw when i get back home i will be coming out with a not a video that's too long just video kind of simply explaining what bands i saw a shot a lot of footage you know quick quick clips of all the acts that I saw except on my first day I didn't get a chance to bring my camera out and on my second day a lot of the concerts were at night a lot of bad lighting so I mean I didn't catch video bands like Agalloch or something like that though I did see them and they were pretty decent but still I just want to talk about who I've been seeing over the past I just brush my teeth Smithers like toothpaste on my face but anyway oh I just want to talk about who i saw for the past few days friday i started off my dad did see gentleman jesse and his man like i planned on but then a friend of mine and this is sort of the funny randomness of South by Southwest a friend of mine came out to me and said uh oh hey do you want to go see do you want to go see glasser and I've seen glass or once before I really wanted to hang out with my friend Maria and a glass or was good live the plate over at the club deville but there was kind of a malfunction during the set the Sun was beating down on their laptop and the set was ended two songs too short but I did get to see glasser and also on the bill was kurt Vile and deer hunter and i was already down in front um I had a chance to go see like grass widow or lacera or like let's see the pains of being pure at heart but you know I've seen all of them live before I mean I've seen the pains being pure at heart live before I haven't seen the other two line before I could have seen J Mascis but I stayed nice stayed there so I could stand in front for kurt Vile so that i could be in the front for deer hunter to never seen deer hunter lie before so i got to see him right up front I could have like reached out and shook and shook like locket punts and bradford cox really close to me as well so I saw them it was fantastic after that I I state for deer hunter I didn't get a chance to see odd future that day because when I got to the venue where they were playing there was like a line around the block so I figured well do I want to go see on future do I want to be in the front for deer hunter I chose deer hunter but I did get to see a chance to c times new viking after that they were really great over at the parish I saw liturgy play at emo's junior they were kind of like looking like they were having a lot of sound problems that you know the mixes of the monitors weren't good for them and maybe there are having a difficult time because of that but still there drummers really intense they were loud sounded like black metal infused with math rock it was pretty awesome if you're into you know something very technical and after that I ran over to let the lustre pearl early because I wanted to see the black lips and because i came early i actually got to see gangs play live and they were really great live though i'm not a huge fan of the of the of the record that they put out they were fantastic in person recommend that for anybody was into soft rock and pop it was funny because the venue over there the lustre pearl was finishing off little dragon and so because gangs was there because little dragon was there there was definitely a lot of pop fans there who didn't quite get the black lips when they came on stage and didn't quite expect everybody to start moshing once the black lip started playing I was also in that mosh pit and I was pretty insane everybody was bouncing around off of each other and I actually saw Darwin Deez in the crowd and I said hey Darwin what's up and he's a cool guy but uh but also a little dragon played after the black after the black lips that she was great little dry but not even she the whole band is great they're drummers a monster and you know the synthesizers were great the bass lines were great they played a cub they played a new track or two and you know she's really great performance all around it was really a felt like I was lucky to see that um and then the next day in the afternoon I saw who was the first band I saw I can't remember damn it's on my camera though it's on this camera but I know in the afternoon I got to see a place to bury strangers i saw woodsmen in the afternoon i was planning on seeing woodsman like at five o'clock but the thing was I didn't get a chance to be given and I didn't get a chance to because I ice I was walking by a venue and they just happened to have like this Colorado music showcase during the day and woodsman was playing at one o'clock so I figured why not see them earlier rather than later so I saw woodsman um then I went over to uh like I said I went I was walking down the street I didn't see you know what happened I was walking down the street I was walking by a couple venues barbarella being one of them and met up with these two guys who were fans of the needle drop I was just kind of bumming around because I had until four o'clock to do something I found chick chick chick was playing over at barbarella you know I like some of their songs so I went down to go see chip chip chip and they were a fantastic live really dancey really fun they played a prince cover and it was great so once I left that I went over to a party that was co-sponsored by Sammy over at the rocket out blog when you see my time got a lot of time co-sponsored by Sammy over at the rocket out blog a place to bury strangers was playing and they were great they were throwing their guitars around the pedals the amplifiers the speaker boxes all looked custom-made they were loud as hell all rumors of that band being loud are confirmed Extremely Loud just fantastic they had a lot of energy there was it was Punk fucking rock to the max after that I kind of had plans to see at my plans to see a lot of stuff that I wanted to kind of got foiled because i want to see Magruder grind over at a emos jr. but uh but I I literally left the place to bury strangers show I walked a block toward the highway and I heard off playing I just heard them I didn't know they were playing I just heard it I just heard off playing somewhere in the distance so I just followed the sound and happened upon off playing a showcase sponsored by fun fun fun fest at the east side drive in there was a line around the block to get into this fest um there was a spare moment where I happened to be walking by and nobody was watching the exit so I ran inside I didn't get any footage of off playing at the Fun Fun Fun Fest because I was in the mosh pit but you know that's kind of my addiction um you know just respect me for that and then and then once off played surfer blood was playing after them i decided to leave because I'd already seen them live and I wanted to go back to get ready for my magruder grind show but then I met up with a a friend of a friend named ahmad and there's video of him on this camera that I will be uh putting into sort of Maya my big south by southwest clip video when I put it up this coming week so uh so you know he said uh oh hey we're going back to the east side drive in and I said you have a surfer blood is playing I've already seen them and he says oh well you know also the dead milkmen are playing I said whoa I want to see the dead milkmen and so we went there and it also happens that chick chick was playing there too so I saw stricter trick twice in one day and got to got to talk with the lead singer backstage just a little bit because it just so happens that a mod is one of the biggest social butterflies I've ever met so when we went to the fun fun fun fest age he got us like backstage VIP free drinks like everything you know food back there like free earpieces you get to stand on the side of the stage and watch the bands it was pretty crazy how many people he knew back there I also met Twin Shadow 2 back there through him and you know a bunch of other people who I guess he's sort of acquaintances with and people who remember him he's a very nice guy yeah so we got me backstage for that um I watched dead milkmen and apparently after dead milkmen Odd Future was playing and I figured out well here's Odd Future I didn't get to see him yesterday let's see him today but for some reason they weren't letting anybody on the side of the stage why Odd Future was playing except for like some you know very very you know highly regarded photographers and like you know they're there press person and like some indie celebs like a member of vivian girls i saw back there but uh but they were letting anybody on the side stage so I didn't stay because I couldn't even shoot video footage of them you know and I couldn't even hear them all that well either so I went down to a another venue just up the road to go see dominique young unique play great emcee fantastic MC and then after that let's see I saw Odd Future was playing again over at the Billboard bungalow buffalo billiards I met up with two guys who came to the video panel that I did to Australian fellows who are very nice guys I sort of left them in the venue to go get closer to the stage I saw a big krit play and I'm not a huge fan of that guy on record but they were great live not only was in playing but his live DJ he had a hype man with him who he said was his brother and and then like sort of miraculously three songs into the set a full band comes out drummer bass player to keyboard players guitar player and a backup singer and then they play a bunch more others then they play a ton of other songs and it was really great once that happened really fleshed the music out and it didn't take away from his prowess as an MC I had a lot of energy a lot of personality got a lot of respect for the guy um then Odd Future played I got time then on future played and you know it's sort of uh to make a to make a long story short I know people are going to want to hear this but like it sucked oh I'm writing in my camera Oh Joseph fucking biking well it's dinnertime give me five minutes 35 minutes close the door ok those are the these private moment in private mode close it so anyway um odd future played and it sucked they came out on stage not even before they came out on stage everybody was yelling swag swag swag swag and then like you could hear Tyler around the microphone saying shut the fuck up shut up and uh you know and it sort of seemed like everybody there the meaner Tyler was the more everybody egged him on and just yeah yeah yeah this rules Wolfgang Wolfgang everybody was just chanting Wolfgang chanting swag and once they finally came out um they had their DJ come on stage but I used the term DJ you loosely because she was pretty much just pressing play on a macbook and then the beat would play and it's like you know the really crappy fruity loop style Odd Future beats that you know really bad quality and just like not produced very well at all and once they came out they were jumping around swearing a lot of cartoon violence in the lyrics like you know getting your dick sawed off of the chains like you know the kind of stuff that like I don't know ICP would rap about that everybody thinks it's cool that odd future does it because you know they're there they're new there fresh but like you know the thing is like the they're decent em season they got good flows and they got personality but the thing is like in between each song and even like during some of the other songs Tyler was being a complete dick to everybody uh he after the first track or the second track rather um he said like Mike to sucks fuck the sound guy fixed that shit he like threw the mic at the sound guy and you know once he told off the sound guy everybody cheered him on and and then and then I was down in front and we were all like jumping around and like people were moshing or not even moshing but kind of jumping into each other not like moshing like a punk pit like kind of just shoving into each other really hard but uh he told everybody in the back of the venue to fuck off and that he wishes they weren't there and he wishes they would go away and he doesn't want them here I don't know why I looked in the back and there's kind of like a lounge area where people were hanging out and I think he was telling them off because they weren't up front or maybe they weren't energetic or maybe they just weren't jumping around his liking I had no clue but he was telling off the people in the back he was telling everybody in the front that they were cool and that they were swag and so they played one song two songs and then I think like I don't even I can't remember off the top of my head did they even finished the third song because the thing is a third of the third track into the set Tyler just goes like fuck this and then he just goes off stage and everybody else in odd future especially their DJ seems kind of confused by this because he just up and left and then and then sort of you know slowly every member of the band sort of petered out and went off stage and then they just kind of ended their performance with only three songs and he was being a total dick to everybody you know was telling everybody in the front they're cool but yet you know he's like you know he doesn't have the balls to finish this performance that you get he's having a little bit of a tough time um I understand that he did other performances that day you know they were probably like I think he did like four showcases maybe even more that day but the thing is like it didn't seem like they were uninor jetta core didn't seem like they were planning this or you know it didn't seem like you know the they were tired from that day and that they didn't want to do another performance because like I said most of the members of Odd Future seemed kind of confused that you know Tyler would just go off stage and be like of this it's over it's done and like you know the thing is of course because you know everybody only cares about Tyler The Odd Future wasn't going to finish the set without him so everybody else just up and left and their DJ was kind of like on stage for like a couple minutes because she thought that they were going to come back but they just didn't and then you know it's funny because for the whole thing every single time Tyler was a jerk everybody egged him on and just like thought he was awesome just like you know screaming Wolfgang and screaming swag but the thing is like you know once he did the ultimate jerk thing which was just end the set early without caring what anybody thinks nobody was cheering a lot of people were doing and a lot of people were mad because a lot of people paid to go see that show and you know I hope bill and billboard was sponsored and billboard sponsored that show and odd features on the cover of billboard this week so I mean you know I wonder if they'd reach some kind of contractual thing by just ending the show early i have no clue so uh you know a lot of the stuff that i'm saying it's only like i'm only supposing you know maybe they planned just going off stage into their set i have no clue it just kind of seems like it was really abrupt and like if you know if anybody in odd future I mean the there might have been a couple people in odd future who knew that you know the set was just going to stop early but it didn't seem like all of them knew that um so yeah just kind of finished with ham sandwiches they'd be played Yonkers and then uh you know and into another track it was just kind of over and a lot of people were dissatisfied by that but still big crate was good so yeah I finished off myself by Southwest experience with what was probably the worst performance there I'm sorry that you guys have to hear that for me you know I know how many people out there were excited to hear you know me say oh add future they were awesome I mean for diet from what I heard about their other shows they were really energetic and when they came out they were too but it seems like you know cut Tyler just didn't care you know they didn't care enough to you know at least entertain the people who were there who were enjoying it and I was to an extent you know it was exciting to see them jumping around and kind of you know see the madness in person but like you know it doesn't seem all that mad now it seems kind of contrived if you can just like jump off stage and not give a shit and just like you know when whether you say it's like you think you're you know then you could say you feel like everybody could everybody in the front who is enjoying the music is cool you could say that but still it's like saying things and what your actions are are two different animals and like you may have said you thought we were cool in the front but you made us feel like dickheads for coming out to the show and just leaving you know without without any warning whatsoever and without even really a reason because the thing is it seemed like he was mad the microphone or the sound guy and it seemed like he was mad at the people in the back but he didn't really explain to us that he was going to leave or why he was going to leave he just left and that's pretty much shanka bullshit to me um so yeah that was last two days of myself by experience let me know what you guys think in the comments like I said I'm going to be coming out with a compilation video once i get back should be tuesday when that's up because i'm going to be here in texas all day sunday and monday afternoon is when i'm actually going to fly in and I should be like you know coming in and around like just before midnight so I had a great time still it was a great experience this whole thing but you guys will see video of that very soon and I need to shave once i get home i look disgusting alright guys have a good day and keep being awesome forever 
1pn-UN4BIUk,okay there's Joe he's a Viking hi everybody Anthony Fantana here the internets busiest music nerd it is my fourth and I guess final day of South by Southwest no more shows I uploaded a video to my other channel last night just so that you guys could see the area during the daytime and that's linked it down there in the d'box I will tell you about yesterday's exploits another time because I have to make this video short and you know just as a sort of a spoiler i did not see half the bands i planned on seeing i saw a bunch and i saw a bunch of other ones instead including deer hunter which i was down in front for so freaked out about that i'll be coming out with another video tonight talking about yesterday and tonight and keep being awesome forever 
QOu40EixjV4,denon it another car vlog yeah cuz long will a wham wham scar vlog intro cuz I'm doing a fucking car vlog uh guys Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd you may have watched my last car vlog I didn't even say forever in my car vlog yeah failure but anyway had another day of South by Southwest today and it was great maybe not as awesome as yesterday's but was still really great no it was it was it was great it was still great um I did shoot a lot of daytime footage but I kind of realized a couple problems number one I don't have any video editing software here with me which is why this and my other video will be unedited and number two I can't exactly play you this daytime footage that I have shot without taking the sound out of it because the thing is there's so much music everywhere in every direction that you go you can't escape it and youtube doesn't like music in my videos that's not mine even if it's being performed somewhere else because I'm partnered so if i do shoot some daytime footage tomorrow i will put it on another youtube channel and Link you guys to it in my next video alright so let's talk about a what i did today who did I see where to start well as you know today was st. Patrick's Day and that affected my exploits during the day greatly greater than I had ever expected because every set throughout the day was going on later than it was supposed to be an earlier than I was supposed to be hardly anything was on time and that kind of really screwed up my schedule but anyway I started a let's see i started with us superhumanoids at one o'clock over at the beauty bar they were decent live they were good they were being shot for BAM TV and you know I talked to the the frontman for the from the band just for a second said hey awesome to see you guys here that was great I tried to see I tried to see braids after that at lovejoys but like I said everything's running late throughout the whole day and when I had gotten there you know at the time that they were supposed to be playing they hadn't even started soundchecking yet so we had to kind of sit their soundcheck and by the time they got through two tracks I had to go to my next thing and but still when braids did play live uh you know I remember one of the things about their record I had kind of reservations about the vocals but live they were fantastic the girl who sings and plays guitar in that band she has a great voice fantastic voice I was great to hear it in person after that I tried to see wild flag over at the NPR event at the parish and but the line was really really freaking long so long if I waited behind it by the time I got inside the parish filed flag set would be over and then after that I tried to see natural child of who you guys may remember I've talked about on the channel before but the thing is because of Saint Patrick's Day everything was running late the bar that they were playing at the jackalope a really cool place if you're in austin a very swanky dirty grimy place in grimy in a good way with a lot of character and oil paintings of nude women all over the walls and a giant a giant rabbit with antlers in the front room this place was running like two or three sets behind and so I came in I saw this band playing and I didn't recognize in his natural child they were called dead gaze asked the name after the set just make sure I wasn't confusing bands but they were still really I bought their 7-inch I left not knowing that uh that natural child was yet to play because i was asking some people he was playing next nobody knows on you know that that's another thing sometimes things are very disoriented at these shows um you know that's that's the thing I think is kind of a misconception about South by Southwest as a festival that it's really regulated and really commercial and all this other BS I mean the thing is like it's basically all these bars in the area and venues and you know sometimes the bands aren't even playing in bars or venues there are there's a church in the area running shows there's a record label I mean a record store in the area running shows their restaurants having people play shows either on the street on patios or you know somewhere inside the area there are bands and artists playing everywhere and you know it's it's just too much going on for for one company or one series of sponsors let's say to take control of because the thing is yes some of these venues are sponsored but a lot of these places where bands are playing art I mean a lot of these bars are just sort of you know having whoever play and you know that those bands aren't listed on websites where you can find you know like sched or something like that that lists out you know sort of the South by Southwest you know sponsored venue you know lineups so it's like you know there's there's a lot going on within those line-ups but yet there's also a lot going on outside of those line-ups that you can you know you can be planning out what you want to do but also just kind of you know let your ear take you where you think you should go oh this sounds awesome let's go in here you know because all these places of course have their windows open and they're all like blasting music at each other it's pretty insane so I tried to see natural child missed them and then later afterwards in the day one of the members of the band said hey thanks for reviewing my record and I turned around and who the hell said that and it was one of the members of the band and I said oh I tried to see you guys but I guess I missed you let's see after that I actually walked over to the east side drive in to c times new viking and off at i guess the pitchfork festival or whatever and but the thing is I'm far too white and and far to Connecticut to stand in the Texas Sun for a prolonged amount of time so I was not there very long especially since it took me a while to walk there the Sun was beating down on me by three or four o'clock and you know I wasn't going to stand out in the in the ninja sun-baked to watch times new viking i mean i think they're playing tomorrow and i'm going to try to see them then in a place with a roof so anyway tried to see atlas sound after that to you know keep in mind all this stuff is running late you know at today and you know so the thing is like I was getting to everything later than I probably would have I tried to see atlas sound at the flamingo cantina from what I know that was his only set at South by Southwest and you know the the line to see him was wrapped around the block so that was a no go to kind of the same situation with wild flag um then after that a friend of mine who I met in Austin she watches the show gotta do a shout-out her name is Jackie sue Jack suey she carded me over to this you know she showed me some venues in the area she's been very nice she's awesome and she carded me over to the what is it the auditorium shores stage where twin shadow and the strokes were playing and I didn't know anything about this place you know I just knew that they were playing and you know every single venue I've been to thus far has been pretty small i figured this would be the same situation so we go there and twin shadows playing first as we walk in and it is a free show so you know anybody can get in no questions asked and it is a gigantic lawn party complete with a huge stage like titantron sized you know big screen next to the stage so that you could see what's going on like kind of up close and what's going on over here fix the lights and and also just a ton of lighting effects going on in the background and mantasy Twin Shadow playing such a huge stage to thousands and thousands and thousands of people all in this grassy area was fantastic i mean you know i think the guy writes great music and i think that you know it's great opportunity for him you know good job great job um he played really well The Strokes after that they were they were ok you know they played the hits they were good when Julian Casablancas first came out I I kind of questioned his level of sobriety not only because his vocals sort of seemed to be all over the place but then he was also forgetting the words to his songs and but then eventually you know they fell into a they fell into a groove and they were playing you know tracks off of a room on fire and just like you know banging him out banging out the hits bringing it together no mistakes it was fantastic um but you know the thing is still I was in an area with Jackie where you know we couldn't even see the stage all we could see was like the the big screen TV and barely that so the thing is like you know though it's cool that the The Strokes are playing this big stage and you know i'm not saying like who you're selling out you're playing a big stage that's not the kind of festival experience i'm looking for is I'm looking for something a little more intimate something that you know I can actually see a little more closely i mean you know like the mistakes the strokes did make during their set which weren't even that big of a deal um I think that I would have Nina they wouldn't have bothered me so much if I wasn't standing so far away from it all you know if I felt like I was having some kind of connection or something going on you know during that moment then maybe it would feel like you know the mistakes didn't matter the mistakes made a unique but instead I just kind of felt like I'm far away from this it kind of sucks how far I am it's like I can't even see the stage and I know most people there couldn't either you know everybody in my area couldn't see the stage um you know the tent like thousands of people at that place couldn't see the stage but yet they were there and you know that's just not that's not my thing it's like that's that's kind of like the why I avoid a lot of festivals you know because I don't want to be in that situation at some situation that interests me I do like the situation at a lot of these smaller venues of South buyer creating though you know it's like a bunch of you know intimate situations going on at once so after the strokes and twin shadow got something to eat and this is going to turn into another story it's pretty screwed up um throughout the day you know and jackie was there with me a couple people had come up to me and introduced themselves and said hey I really love your videos i watch and you know I said thank you shoutouts to anybody who approached me um and you know we were going into Whole Foods just to get something to eat and she said hey I bet you somebody's gonna recognize you in whole foods and I said BS you know nobody's gonna recognize me we're just gonna get food and we're gonna you know eat and go so you know we bet five dollars and so we're getting our food nobody's noticed me I'm kind of shoving that in her face and you know I'm gonna get five bucks I'm going to get five and then as I'm wringing out my food I look across two registers over and there's this dude with long hair and a beard and a napalm death shirt napalm death t-shirt from what I can rely from recollect from what I could recollect just staring at me to cash registers away and you know I just smiled and you know look look the other way you know I die you know the bet is still in my mind but you know I figured out he's he's a metal and he's a napalm death fan he doesn't watch the needle drop you know I've never reviewed napalm death rationalizing the situation so i bought my food and then I hear in my right ear are you Anthony and then I turn and it's the guy with the Napalm Death t-shirt and I said yes I look to my left Jackie's there she's watched the whole thing I can't fake it now you know she's like yes winning winning and he says what who's that why is she saying winning and I said well you know you just made me lose a bet and he says oh cool could I could I get any of those bet winnings you know and so I said hey it's nice to meet you thanks for saying hi what's what's your name and he says Grayson and in my head I only know one name only one person whose name is Grayson and that's a Grayson current who is a writer music critic rock critic whatever um you know I guess in the same boat as I am a music reviewer you know in a while while back maybe some of you old needle drops remember like you know he wrote some tweet dissing the needle drop saying that the needle drop is so bad that it makes him want to quit music journalism and you know I and so my first reaction was don't you hate the needle drop you know aneesa's known as I was just screwing with you joking nose picking on you everybody gets picked on it's okay don't worry about it so I guess I was relieved that he was a serious but then again i did lose five dollars so yeah yeah just just a huge bowl of like you know karma soup right there for me like nobody's going to notice me somebody notices me and it was somebody who I perceived hated what I did but I guess he doesn't hi Grayson if you're watching so after that you know he said hey where you going are you gonna go see a Glock tonight and you know that kind of persuaded me a Glock wu-tang Agalloch wu-tang I went to go see a clock so they were playing at barbarella and they were great they played a grace you know the thing is like they were really energetic playing well but you know there was an issue there and there's an issue at a lot of these venues because the thing is they try to pile in so much talent and so many acts all together at once that you not you but everything feels so rushed and because of that like soundcheck lasts you know just just a couple minutes you know there's no proper soundcheck going on so you know there's there's a lot of wonky mixes all throughout the day and Agalloch had one of the wonky asst unfortunately you couldn't hear hardly any of the guitar leads from where I was standing anyway I heard plenty of base and plenty of rhythm guitar but the drums were a little buried and just like hardly any of the leads and hardly any of the soloing which you know for me is kind of just as important as everything else and um you know that there are other instances of that stuff going on throughout the place I mean throughout the throughout all these places just because you know they're trying to they're trying to get people to come in and come out and get these you know just bang out all these shows at once when you know honestly it takes time if you want to do it really well that was oh I saw one more thing after a Glock I saw Owen Pallett and he was great he was great live I mean I'm you know there was still like a little wonkiness with the mix there but it could have been from where I was standing I was like right next to a speaker but still he performs really really well with the keyboard and loop machine I mean the loop pedals and the g's and the violin he's just a talent he's great and he sings too Owen you're great keep being awesome and he was at emo's and I forgot one more show that I did see at a great venue on stage on 6th what's so cool about that venue they just have a bunch of orange amplifiers that people play through an orange amp sounds great and another thing the whole venue is like wood which is great for the acoustics you know everything is just warm everything syncs in there's no hard bouncing Indiana the things echoing off the walls because everything is made of stone or metal so it's like you know Highwoods ceiling wood walls it was just really nice a swanky place um another swanky place that went to for a little bit just because I sort of wandered in because I was in the wrong place but another place called Shakespeare's shakespeare's pub um really cool you know kind of dark lots of you know western music playing over the speakers three bars downstairs upstairs patio and on both patios you can watch the same stage and a stage like kind of carved out of stone with likely the pub's name you know etched into the front of it so it's like a it's a cool little place and I shot video of most of these you know areas so um so I'm going to be posting that sort of a montage of all of that when I get back home um and you know that was that was pretty much my day man I just like just a lot of stuff going on had a good time just like you know experiencing this this festival I mean I'm sold on it I've had a great time one more I've had a great time I definitely coming back to this thing next year it's like it's it's just a great festival for me it's like the YouTube of festivals you don't need to like what everybody else likes you could just go off and watch or listen to whatever you want to listen to you know you're not forced to sit through something you know you hate if you don't want to because there are alternatives there are alternatives everywhere and that's the beauty of it you know you're not limited to one or two or three stages like you are at other festivals you know you could go wherever you want to go and see whatever you want to see chances are if you're going to a certain type of music there's at least a little bit of it going on over there I mean you know there are musicians playing up and down the streets from you know like Krusty full punkers to a complete horn band I saw people gathered around this horn band waving like white pieces of white cloth white handkerchiefs and they were all dancing in the street to this horn band I just sort of put themselves in an intersection and that's another thing that there's the sixth street in Austin you know there are a bunch of streets in downtown area it's like a grid and 63 gets shut down completely people are just walking all up and down the street getting to the next venue they want to get to and even the streets branching off of 63 have pretty limited access you know and even on the the streets above and below people are still running around in the road even if cars are going by you know it's it's a very slow pace if you're a driver in that area and you know just to give you a sense of how overwhelming the crowd is there I mean if they did have the street running still I mean there would be too many people to fit on the sidewalks alone which is why they're all out in the street um you know I I imagine it was just kind of a just a natural choice because you know there were so many people in the area over time that you know it would it just became a safety hazard you know but a friend of mine you know also tells me that done on some weekends they shut down 6th Street as well I don't live in Austin I'm not an expert but still that's how many people are there you know and and and still I mean even if shutting down 6-3 is a regular occurrence there's no possible way they could still keep that street running during South by Southwest because so many people are in that area at once the sidewalks would just be impossible to move through you know and people of like all ages races and you know both genders of course and you know looks like people of different religious backgrounds all you know going up and down this street people of all walks of life just listening to and exploring the world of music via these different venues and bars and it's just a really cool place to be it's you know it's like Disneyland you know you go on the ride you want to go on I really want to go on you know I really want to go on the james blake mom they just built the new james blake i want to go on it has three loops on it okay fine we'll go on to james blake as soon as we're done going on on the times new viking i hate the times new viking you know that's what it's like it's like that so I think this I got to end this vlog thanks for watching I'm having a great time I'm going to shoot some daytime video tomorrow and just keep being awesome forever 
jQu_4yEyASc,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the internets let's get some more light on the situation busiest music nerd I'm in Texas right now I'm staying with a friend of mine he's letting me sleep in his place and borrow his car which means when i'm done with shows at the end of the night I come home and he's sleeping so i need to vlog in his car so i can make that um although i forgot my freakin papers in the apartment whatever i'll go from memory ah first I can't talk about South by Southwest without talking about what I did Monday and that was see godspeed you black emperor play at terminal 5 in New York and they were awesome they started with lift your skinny fists and she's you know just they started with that album and they were playing you know some some of course they played the intro off of that LP and just like beautiful gorgeous and then every track after that was just melancholy and dreary and depressing and there were images projected images behind them of like polluting factories and you know junkyards and grimy buildings it was really really gritty gritty performance they put on a great set they just sounded fantastic the whole time that is blew me away if you get a chance to see him go ahead and do a colin stetson opened up for them um I didn't know he was going to and it was kind of a last-minute surprise but that was fantastic I want to say hi to everybody who who saw me there and recognized me and said hey and I also want to give a special special special shout-out to Chris who saw me dropped my wallet or saw my wallet was dropped out of my pocket and then he was like oh hey dude is that your wallet and I'm like oh hey yeah it is i kind of need that or else i won't be able to go to South by Southwest when I get on the plane so anyway today first day of South by Southwest first thing I had to do was go do my pain my vlogger panel and it went really really great most of the people there didn't even know who the heck me and sammy and mike from consequence of sound were they came out of curiosity of what we were talking about um there were some people there who knew who knew me and you know they got hugs afterwards saw a short kind of exclusive video and then and then we saw not saw but talked about our thing talked about what we do answered questions um it was really great treated as some business cards networking I guess you kind of have to do these days um so yeah that was really fun then after that I went to go see Anamanaguchi they killed it they killed it on the patio over at the Palm D'Or um you know the electronics being sequenced you know playing off of a you know recording and then you know they're playing guitars live it was a good mix you know it was awesome there were these young kids who couldn't come to the show because it was 21 and over and they were like watching from this you know stream across the way we were waving to them and when I'm had a gameboy and he was like yeah gay boy yeah how about a Gucci um after that geez who did I see after Anamanaguchi I no event I can t remember who I instantly instantly saw after anamanaguchi just like the whole day I saw so many groups it was just a blur i remember i'll try to go backwards i saw sharon van etten last over at swan dive and she was fantastic she mellowed me out she's great live she's got a fantastic voice I've reviewed her look for the review on the channel before Sharon I saw Bad Brains over at emo's I moshed the entire set I got whacked in the face which is probably why there's a bump here and also my glasses came off my face and as soon as my glasses came off and everyone realized everybody stopped washing no more washing stop find those glasses and they were found they were bent on the arm a little bit i fixed it and they're fun you know totally good no problems before that off played at emo's and they were fantastic just as fantastic as I thought they would be before that I think I saw be connection plank I just kind of went to go visit them out of curiosity and they were great before that after anamanaguchi now I remember I saw telekinesis play at waterloo records and you know what the the the truth is the fact of the matter is that everybody that I saw played great live everybody was great in terms of performance you know nobody nobody was a dud I've heard you know some stuff back and forth about you know off sucking live or like you know bad brain sucking live but you know they were they were really energetic and bad brains you know they do their own thing you know they're they're not into freaking out all over the stage you know it's like after every after every song is over it's you know it's or a minute thank you thank you thank you thank you you know they're very chill guys you know it's like that's that's their thing um but still was great they were great performing and everybody was totally into it the mosh pit was fantastic you know shoving people sweaty crazy as soon as I walked out this girl came up to me and said you look like you had the time of your life and I did I met a bunch of people on the street to you know I was just walking by people and like hey you're even e Fantan oh and I'm like yeah I am every day and I want to give a shout-out thanks to all those people who recognize me on the street and came up and were not shines at hi um yeah and then that's it I just that was my first day and that was that was just my first it was fantastic it was amazing non-stop shows you know I had some stuff he had a falafel at this place called extreme pita it was really good over there um just good food good music cool people everywhere people probably cooler than me but whatever and yeah I just had a great freaking time overall I'm really happy that I can share this with you but uh yeah what tomorrow I think I'm going to see a Glock I'm gonna try a sikh feller talk I'm also going to try to see superhumanoids in the afternoon did i say i saw colin stetson today I saw him and he came up and he was like hey i saw your review and sharon van etten two before i even went to go see your life she spotted me on the street she's like you're have to be Fantana I'm like yep yeah I am your sharon van etten it was funny everybody who everybody who I have reviewed you know who boo saw me like has recognized me like hey awesome thanks for the review yeah you know it's like I actually go see the people I review because I like their music oh but you know so that shouldn't be a surprise um so anyway I'm done thank you for watching this long rant tomorrow I hope to bring this camera out and just kind of film some of the footage because it is it is an interesting sight to see because when you walk down all these streets in Austin there is music everywhere I mean you know you could go online and see lists of artists playing but there are tons of artists playing in every nook and cranny of the city just walking by on sixth or seventh street you see all sorts of people playing I saw these two dudes rocking out on a drum set and a didgeridoo out in the middle of just the street and everybody was totally feeling it they're like yeah didgeridoo awesome so uh so it's like I hope to bring this out and just kind of give you guys a taste of some of the imagery I've been I saw yesterday but tomorrow um it's it's it's really cool it's kind of like a you know the YouTube of music festivals because you know you don't have to watch things you don't like just go to another venue and see something you do like because there are a hundred things going on at any given time so yeah I'm having a great time thank you for helping me make this happen by supporting the channel and being awesome and yeah I'm not doing any blogging on the website this week just because i'm not i'm not near it i'm not near a computer i'm just gonna have to upload this somehow I'll figure it out because you're gonna see this video all right Oh lights off

crazy you're crazy next time I put a video up on the channel I will be in Texas a kind of reporting and just saying what my experiences are but before I go I want to leave on a high note so Rex is a Boston MC this is latest LP rithmatic eternal king supreme this is my first introduction to him I honestly have no clue how this guy has been able to release release stuff since 2001 and I've never ever ever heard of him but now I'm here so let's talk about the beats as far as rhythms as far as production goes on this album Rex gets a big big endorsement from a lot of heavyweights in hip-hop who have made a lot of history in the genre DJ Premier The Alchemist even sean combs and lv and how could i forget Pete Rock but most of the production credits go to statik selektah who is also the CEO of the record label that this album is on convenient but even though the sound of this LP is spread out over a lot of different producer credits the style is still really consistent crisp boom bap drums hard hitting bass lines a lot of piano samples even a harp sample on the track kilim a lot of soul samples on here too that I absolutely loved one of the best of them being on the track of this or that where the song am ia good man by them to is gutted to make one of the best beats on the album but ghostface killah might have gotten more attention for sampling that track when he dropped it on the first song of his latest LP Apollo kids but they both kill it in their own way and the samples sampled by two different producers do have a very different and result all in all the sounds on this LP our base Glee the kind of stuff that bill the Empire of East Coast hip-hop and even in an age of auto-tune this stuff has not lost its flavor in fact with the really beefy mixing throughout this entire LP it's kind of like this style this sound got a well well well deserved upgrade their only a few spots where I didn't like the beats for example the wonder years that's just one of the couple tracks that doesn't survive off of sampling just has some really crummy synthesized horn some electronic sounding drums it just doesn't fit into the sample based tape istry that the rest of the LP is sewn into I just like samples I'm bias don't listen to me as far as his flow goes nasty wreck sounds so hungry throughout this entire LP i love it when he's going hard on some of these tracks I feel like I'm watching a man move a mountain he's unstoppable and when a heartbreaking song comes on I still can't help but hang on this guy's every word not only because he knows how to pen a story but he's got a really demanding personality as far as subject matter goes the topical element of this album this thing is kind of like driving a Lamborghini he is going as fast as possible the pedal is to the floor it starts off with 25th hour which is a track that kind of announces the death of the Golden Age of rap maybe a late announcement but still if this style of music is going to continue and flourish it needs to stop looking at the past and live in the present and then he basically takes the car and steers it in the direction of today's hip hop icons like Nicki Minaj young money entertainment little wayne kanye west waka flocka flame and def jam and raps about how he could sell out with some kind of recipe that they're cooking with making fun of the pretentious RT stick lifestyle on the red carpet he lays that sentiment all over the track limelight and i love it when this guy wants to be hard he'll slap you but when he wants to be funny and sarcastic and really put a piece of satire together he's just as good he continues the rap ridicule on kill him where he kind of talks about the legitimacy of murder raps and calls a lot of people out on their BS for acting tougher than they actually are he makes fun of hipster rappers rkelly although I don't really get the gay slurs that he mentions a couple times on that track I mean you know it's 2011 do we really need to be saying things are gay and rap music so eventually because this album is not an action movie rex kind of runs out of ammo and to me runs out of enemies to shoot at and you start to see the anger that caused him to do that eat it him away a little bit and you get to see kind of what the root source of it is he raps about the frustration of trying to come up in the rap game and still kind of stay true to himself he brings up his childhood a lot in a way that this LP is almost like watching a montage of this guy's past featuring the untimely death of his father which was caused by AIDS watching his drug-addicted mother suffer from lupus and also a bit of irony in here to being a kid hating the fact that his mother smoked and now being an adult himself and being a smoker and he also brings up the trials and tribulations of being a father himself after the track mascara the song like a star is like the the perfect epilogue to this LP will it all work out I kind of feel like we're left with a gigantic to be continued floating in the middle of the screen overall in loving this LP and I'm loving Rex he really really kind of reminds me of ke RS one in that he's provocative when he has something to say he says it a lot of rappers out there talk trash but nobody out there will name a name and this guy does he names a lot of names and he doesn't stop a lot of people in mainstream rap today are afraid to step on toes but Rex is not in fact he stops on toes and right before he starts he puts on a fresh pair of golf shoes so great beats strong flow memorable lyrics I'm feeling a decent too strong 8 on this LP I hope it gets more notoriety over the course of the because i know i'm going to be remembering income december Anthony Fantana Rex forever so 
GGCejKgpKzQ,pop the trunk on you yeah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd going to do a list right now colin stetson is not moving from that spot ah 15 bands that i'm going to see when I go down to South by Southwest I'm going to see a lot of groups while I'm down there I'm going to see more groups than are on this list but these are kind of like my must seize the band's I must see before i leave Texas to start i do want to see Ferguson Geronimo their debut album I liked I really love the singles that these guys put out before that and they are Texas natives I'm excited to see them play in their homeland if there is entertaining in person as they are on record they should put a good show together another thing i want to do while I'm down in South by Southwest is see a lot of loud bands I want to see loud I want to hear loud i want to feel loud so i want to see a place to bury strangers i'm going to go seek feller talk I'm gonna go see wheter I'm going to see liturgy I'm going to try to make it to as many off shows as possible depending on whether or not i think the first show i see from the van is really good and something that's really heartbreaking for me this is kind of like a co spot on the list um a Glock and the wu-tang clan are playing on the same day at the same time which means i have to pick so if anybody knows of some kind of secret or different or extra show that either of those two groups are playing let me know i would love to see both of them i don't want to have to choose but it looks like I'm gonna have to I want to see colin stetson of course he's playing a handful of shows down there sharon van etten as well I want to see her live I've seen so many videos of her on the internet and she's just such a fantastic performer she has a great voice and I just want to see her in person give her a high five I want to see des racist I want to see immortal technique I want to see blue who's supposed to have a new LP coming out this year I want to see him before that comes out I want to see superhumanoids in la band that I pipe down the channel before there last EP was really great I want to see gentleman jesse and his men a great great great garage rock group and another garage rock group who I love and am yet to see live missed them once when I had the chance to see them but I think it's going to be awesome to see them in person the black lips and that looks like my entire list of 15 groups artists spans whatever that I want to see definitely when I go down to South by Southwest if you're heading down let me know who you're going to see what group should i consider that i have not put on this list and i do want to see a lot of metal bands down there a lot of loud stuff i do know that brooklyn vegan is going to be holding some metal showcases I'm yet to check those out and see what the lineups are but still you know Yura you know on to the path of some metal let me know some awesome metal ok that's those are groups that I definitely want to see when I'm down there I will be leaving at the beginning of next week on Tuesday Monday in New York City I'm going to see godspeed you black emperor at terminal 5 in New York City it's going to be an awesome week of shows for me I'm going to try to put together some videos while I'm down there also while I'm down there the rocket out blog and I and the editor of consequence of sound have a video vlogger music panel where we will be discussing the importance or i guess the relevance the growing relevance of music vlogging on the internet um hit up that panel link to find information on it down there in the description bar I would love it if you came down all needle drops who come down to that panel get a hug from this guy let me know what you think of the list if you're going who are you going to see forever you 
RS6qsVXB7h8,ninja hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd going to do a review here but first there's a guy on YouTube you know him and he just got himself a copy of the new Colin Stetson album on vinyl you want to guess who it is no it's not MacOS or FM before I get into this review linked down there in the description bar a piece of music from a Swedish singer-songwriter anna von house wolf she is fantastic this LP came out last year went largely unnoticed I'm thinking about reviewing it but I want to know what you guys think about the music tell me down there in the comments and also linked down there a new music video from a rapper by the name of Rex it's awesome pretty much a year ago Burzum had released its first album since its sole member Varg been released from jail Bellus while i am a fan of black metal I'm a fan of it because I like how it sounds I like the style I like the genre it's not because I am totally in with the ideology or I follow the exploits of its figureheads I have no clue what true black metal is I couldn't care less all I know is that I like what I hear when I hear what I like and that showed up in my Bellis review when I was pretty harsh on the mixing and the repetition and a lot of people were not happy about that whatever you can't stop me from listening to Burzum I don't care now I'm not going to beat around the bush here in my opinion this thing is definitely an improvement upon what bard was doing on Bellis the biggest change for me is in the mixing and production department not to say that hardcore black metal fans need to jump shift this thing is still rough around the edges it's still very distorted very rough a lot of ferocity this thing is like getting caught in the middle of a blizzard and you're freezing to death and just before you take that final breath a pack of wolves come in and just tear you to shreds the guitar still have that tinny texture to them that we're used to hearing on version LPS but there's a balance going on here the guitars are a little lower the vocals are no longer fighting with them for room in the mix you can feel hear the drums there is a debase and though the repetition that I talked about on the last LP is here to an extent I can tell Varg has worked harder to flesh his songs out put a lot more meat on the bone with these tracks just take the title track for example starts with a guitar riff then builds into drum and bass harsh vocals in the verse then matching the harsh vocals up with clean vocals in the chorus just a lot of progression a lot of different stuff to take notice of and this may not be a very cult thing to say but it's pretty catchy song to catchy Bellus may have been more about atmosphere creating a place for you to put your head into this thing is definitely more about direction another noticeable change from Bela stew here is that Varg is using a lot more clean vocals in these songs and it's added a really cool dynamic to switching that up with the screaming the singing I do gotta give vark props on his screams though he sounds like a wild animal now overall this thing lasts 47 minutes it's spread over seven tracks two of which are an ambient intro and an outro so it's pretty easy to find out which songs you do and don't like pretty quickly you really only have five to pick from for me egg faller has a good hook but it drags on for me a little bit and I do like where the song van vyd goes but starting the track off with two straight minutes of blast beats is just a bore I do like each man to his own though really nice dissonant guitars on that one really broods very dark I'm feeling a heavy heavy mood on that track and the last rock track on here the message as soon as an epic epic intro flies by it goes into a drumbeat that you could find in like any old rock song between the stronger drumbeats here the cleaner mix to me this is like Varghese most accessible album he's ever put together under the Burzum name there are three songs on here I really liked to that I was kind of on the fence with and the intro the outro really didn't add into the equation for me at the end of the day I'm kind of left wanting more which has stopped me from loving this record but I still do like it I'm kind of feeling a decent two strong six on this thing for sure now that being said though I do like this I don't endorse the ideology of this guy especially when it comes to homosexuality and race I don't really care what the guy believes just as long as he doesn't try to sell it to me in his music and I have looked over the lyrics on this album and the lyrics basically deal with death nature pagan gods but I did take a look at the lyrics on the message which deal with nationalism an army the family unit the white world and using the blood of your cowardly enemies to fertilize your soil and according to a recent metal succs interview Varg actually kind of censored himself on that song I would love to hear the director's cut and he says this is because and I quote there is no real freedom of speech anywhere well if Varg is not jailed for what he says in terms of his beliefs then he has freedom of speech if a bunch of internet trolls or people who don't like his ideology go and hate on him for believing what he believes that's different that's not a loss of freedom of speech just because you are free to say what you want to say doesn't mean people have to like it I deal with that every day I can't just make a video and say an album sucks and when a bunch of people come up to me and say you're an idiot it doesn't work that way sorry yeah it doesn't so if you're racist at least be open about it then I can say hey you know that guy's racist that's what he believes I'll just leave him over there and avoid him so now I kind of have this hot potato in my hands that I don't really want to deal with and though I do like this album it's not like I like it so much I could just ignore this fact you may call it closed-minded but I don't deal with Glenn Beck's BS why would I deal with vars so don't be surprised if in the future I'm a little more hesitant to review anything this guy does all right Anthony Fantino forever [Music] 
ruD60TlP5ng,hey it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantan Oh here internets busiest music nerd time to do a track review haven't done one on the channel in a while I did have another hip-hop review lined up though but that would have been my third one in a row and that just wouldn't have felt right but still I want you to check this LP out mayhem Lorenz self-induced illness there's an audio review down there in the description box linked on the needle drop calm can't even likes the album cow what do you think of a self-induced illness sounds like a reason that call 911 is your mustache that's no this is just paint it's depressing also down there in the d'box here a new track from the upcoming Holy Ghost album it's good it's good so let's touch down on a track from the upcoming explosions in the sky LP take care take care take care these guys are a texas band most commonly associated with the genre of post-rock it's been four years since their last release which has brought up a lot of questions what happened in that for years did they change their sound did they improve upon the sounds that they were working with on their last LP we'll just have to listen to the first single the drop from the album lake down there explosion in the sky trembling hands I wonder if post-rock is dead or if it's dying if you guys remember from my review of mog wise latest LP hardcore will never die but you will they simplified their formula a lot there to not milking every single moment that came across their birth of a path really dramatic guitar phrasing they were really sounding like a straight forward to the point in your face rock band and explosions in the sky is doing a very similar dance here to this thing takes absolutely no time to build up which is fine you get these snares that sound like shotguns going off the shimmering guitars sounds very similar to what we've heard them do on their last LP it's all just kind of been condensed which I would say would make fans squeamish if these guys hadn't worked in that vein in the past look at their 2005 travels and constants there is a lot of layered repetition all over that release and that most definitely happens here whether you're being really romantic about it and slowing things down taking nine minutes to say what you want to say or if you're going straight for the throat both can be really powerful what's killing me is the similarity of the two sounds from here to their last album on this song anyway it just sounds like some kind of extra moment or b-side from all of a sudden I miss everyone and also what is that sound hanging in the background when lamp lamp my aunt my aunt my aunt my I don't want to know what that sound is I don't want to know where it's coming from because knowing what that is isn't going to make me like it I'm still not gonna like it it just seems like it's it's really distracting to me and muddying up the mix and just not really adding anything to the progression of the song you've got these really bland hunting vocals that that take up the you've got these really bland humming vocals that take up a lot of time in the first portion of the track and in terms of melody and just structure unless this is your first listen to the band for me someone who's listened to a lot of their stuff over and over it just doesn't feel all that memorable nothing really stuck with me you know overall i'm not really disappointed with the song i mean stuff like this has happened to me before take the gorilla song stylo for instance there are some songs that sound way better within the context of the album i'm feeling like a decent too strong five on this and ate and ate my kingdom for an eight but what do you guys think of this track are you loving it are you hating it why what's your favourite post-rock band and what do you think i should review next and what did you think of explosions in the skies last album Anthony Fantana take care take care take care trembling hands forever you 
USKRwIsBG04,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd thank you for watching we're gonna do an album review before we get into that an awesome live video of Colin Stetson over at the needle drop com linked down there in the description box below this video that's the D box that's a copy of mad villains mad villainy and this is the new Raekwon album Shaolin vs. wu-tang if you've been subscribed to this channel for a while then you know I'm a big fan of the wu-tang clan I think their sound is one of the most important to ever happen in rap music ever everybody has their favorite members of the wu-tang clan I'm more of an old dirty bastard Ghostface Killah kind of guy but Raekwon has my respect too this thing is the follow-up to only built 4 Cuban Linx part 2 which was really really well-received by critics and whether or not you think that was a worthy follow-up to the original this I think it's pretty apparent to me lives up to neither of the two a common complaint about Cuban Linx part two is that it didn't have enough beats from wu-tang's producer RZA on it and if that worked you on that LP this one should bother you even more because it has a total of no RZA beats on it but it's not like a wu-tang member necessarily needs Rizzo's production to make their new album good I mean look at the Ghostface Killah album fish-scale do you know who has the most production credits on that MF DOOM so ya know RZA beats here but a bunch of beats that try to imitate that RZA sound why with the atmospheric hanging in the background sound effects and dialogue from kung-fu movies really eerie eerie instrumentation it just boggles my mind if you're gonna try to grab that RZA sound why not just get rizz or work with RZA instead of having a bunch of different producers tried to copy that instead why not have them work toward their strengths and develop a different sound unlike cuban linx part two i don'tfeel Raekwon exploring anything outside of the sounds that were used to hearing him play with he's kind of just settling into a shadow of what the wooh aesthetic is when Raekwon does do something that's a little bit of a surprise or tries to throw a left hook it misses by a mile chop chop which has really really corny group vocals all over the hook and the auto-tune hook on rock and roll this is the kind of stuff that to me whoo tang always stood as an alternative to and yet it's here there are a lot of good guest MCS here Method Man lays down a great verse on every soldier black thoughts pretty good here too even though he doesn't really stick around as long as I would hope he would lester rhymes is okay of course you've got Ghostface Killah tearing it up on a few tracks but then you've got a lot of MCS here that I'm kind of surprised to hear from guys who I don't really feel like fit into the gritty whoo aesthetic like Lloyd Banks or Rick Ross especially Jim Jones - I didn't really like Jim Jones on ghost faces new album and I'm still not a fan of him here my least favorite tracks here the ones that have all these bells and whistles that I really don't feel like work with the wu-tang aesthetic are the longest some of the best tracks are the shortest however they blow by so fast that they don't really leave an impression they have some good rhymes they have some decent beats behind them but they just kind of feel like they're there and gone a few of the vocal mixes are off most of the beats don't have any beef behind them a lot of them come off as really repetitive edited headed repetitive repetitive repetitive the beats in production here aren't the worst thing in the world but I've heard Raekwon's spit over much much better when it comes to rapping and flow Raekwon is good that's to be expected he's a Raekwon I've used this term recently I'm gonna use it again it's just kind of a stay at home album an LP whose sound is just so predictive so comfortable that it's pretty much just for the fans I feel like this is kind of a transitional moment between Cuban Linx 2 & 3 he even hypes 3 in the lyrics so I'm feeling like a strong 5-2 ally six on and there are some alright moments some decent tracks but most of it I'm just kind of on the fence on what do you think of this album do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next thanks for watching Anthony Fantana Raekwon wu-tang wu-tang wu-tang forever you 
Cy67iqBfdws,screw of snow hi everyone Anthony Pham tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd gonna do an album review new Lupe Fiasco LP lasers I'm going to South by Southwest next week I have a video panel I would love for you guys to come I'm going to link information to that video panel down there in the D box because I'm going to be planning my exploits there may not be as many blog posts on the blog this week okay okay well if you don't know Lupe Fiasco is a Chicago MC whose first album a lot of people would call a breath of fresh air he wasn't the first MC to be socially conscious but still it was nice to hear somebody who had a firm consistent ideology but wasn't really preachy or in-your-face about it and that practice has carried over onto this new LP I love this guy's personality I love his flow I love the fact that he leaves no stone unturned and calls everybody out on their from Glenn Beck to Barack Obama he brings up racism here the mainstream media hypocrisy Zinn society he calls the Rat Pack black and 50-cent white as far as rhymes and subject matter go I think he's coming off as as smart as ever for me and though I may not always agree with the guy on what he says he has a message and he sticks to it and pretty much every breath in his body is spent conveying that message to other people I can admire that side of that this LP suffers from some serious serious problems and that is terribly produced sing-songy choruses that distract from not only the message of the song but the feel of the rap verses before them if the chorus is here aren't auto-tune they transform the song into a terrible techno song for ten second intervals though I may really love and I mean love the rhymes on a song like beautiful lasers uh the choruses basically render songs like that on and the beats are pretty bad too with just all the overproduction the heavy electronics the the really really really overbearing compression too that makes all the sounds bleed into each other and just make it all sound so messy and ugly and seriously it depresses me to no end to see Lupe wrapped up in all this terrible terrible awful production that does not complement his message at all he with his words is saying revolt point out hypocrisy be your own person screw the man and instead the music is saying hit me baby one more time the beginning of this thing isn't too bad but it just gets sweeter and sweeter just more sugary as you continue through it as soon as I heard the song state-run radio I thought this thing deserves to be on Radio Disney for me the last track here is like the final nail in the coffin I am done with this LP let's just bury it and move on I know that's a nasty thing to say but that's how I feel like I said earlier in the review it saddens me to see a talent like Lupe being drowned in all this major label BS in terms of what should be on the album what shouldn't be on the album when the album is going to be released he is too good to be dealing with people who don't understand his artistic vision there are a few standout moments here I really love the ambitious beat on the song all black everything and what Liu Bei says in that song as well and I really like the way the song the show goes on progresses and I could totally accept the reworking of that modest mouse hook for that song it's adapted really well to the point where it feels familiar but it doesn't feel like he's just simply ripping off that track those songs are not enough to save this thing from like a strong three to a light four I mean I could maybe see some hardcore fans getting into this thing but sadly it's it's just not cutting the mustard for me the the rhymes are great I love Lou Bay's personality but still I can't come terms with these beats I'm going to clean out my ears with some 36 chambers and I'm going to move on Anthony Fantana Lupe Fiasco lasers forever [Music] you 
Gc0Jpf_25a4,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's most ambient drone nerd time for an album review Tim hackers rave death 1972 oh I'm finally getting to this review now because this help you took me a while to digest don't rush me on these things guys Tim Hecker is a Canadian musician whose albums really take long uninterrupted listens to fully appreciate it's not exactly something you listen to on the go not something you put on shuffle in the iPod rave death is an interesting follow-up to this guy's most recent work for me and a return to more of the distorted and dissonant sounds on an LP like mirages because to me and this is just my opinion maybe his stuff on an imaginary country for example was just way too heavenly pleasant-sounding though I'm sure some people seek that out I'm of the opposite so rave death imagine a post-apocalyptic city the buildings are crumbling the landscape is gray everything looks fuzzy and blurred because there's all sorts of dust and just dirtiness hanging in the air there's only one person left on the planet and if you were that person this album would be the deafening silence you would hear for the rest of your life the whole thing front to back is like a barren wasteland of echoes leftover from a society that used to be there there are signs that life was in this spot whether it be the pianos or the organs or the guitar but the lack of structure proves that there's nothing alive to be found it's like the neglect that these sounds endured over the years caused them to sprawl just grow over each other creating this droney soundscape I hear things when I hear this album but I see a lot of things too I just see a lot of vivid vivid imagery it kind of reminds me of that Twilight Zone episode with burgess Meredith when he's trying to read but nobody will let him read and then the bomb drops while he's in a bank and then he finally has time to read and then he breaks his glasses and he can't this sound is what happens this is the sound track to everything that happens to him after the episode fades to black some moments here do feel like they could have gone on longer though to gain more vastness like the opener or analog paralysis 1978 but the three two to three part epochs on this LP make up for that entirely in the fog in the air hatred of music real highlights on this LP and loaded with textures and things that sound like other things that our moments were I'm pretty sure I'm hearing like string sections or voices though it doesn't make any note of that in the liner notes so I'm sure they're not to me the crowning achievement of this album is how Hecker has created something that has a real real appearance of formlessness and that's not easy to do some tracks on here do feel like they have more intent than others like hatred of music part one which escalates beautifully just like too beautiful for words for me but most of the time here you're just kind of staring at endless landscapes lost cities and that can be just as breathtaking as something that has a real real appearance of structure and planning now I'm not going to make the case that this is the most unique LP on the planet there's a lot of stuff out there like this especially if you do research on the label that this came off of cranky so why is Tim Hecker worth your time more than these other people well to me his music when I'm listening to it I don't feel like I'm observing a piece of art on the wall and standing here and just staring I feel like I'm in it I feel like I'm surrounded by it and to me that's kind of what makes the difference call it ambient call it drone call it whatever I'm calling it a light a the pieces on this thing remind me of everything from Eno to the really quiet interludes on let's say a god speed you black Emperor album and I'm sure all of you want to know what Cal thinks of Tim Hecker if you took care of your computer you wouldn't have to worry about hackers and I hate coucher chest up Anthony Fantana Tim Hecker rave death 1972 forever [Music] you 
_ccX1kbdU4U,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's sluttiest music nerd first that ggc's sound it might be a little linked down there in the D box on the needle drop comm is a track review from the new da vodka LP a review of the new Beach fossils EP and an awesome rap song mm-hmm it's been a while since I've done a metal review and I'm sorry I say I'm sorry I hope to atone for this sin by touching down on the new weed eater album Jason the dragon Jason is not only a weird name for a dragon but Jason the dragon is a weird name for a weed eater album but whatever what do I know weed eater is a North Carolina sludge metal band this is their fourth LP Steve Albini produced just like their last one and this thing is one of the most immediately enjoyable metal albums I've come across in a while now if you're a fan of doom metal sludge metal just metal music with a heavy edge I know why you're a fan you know why I'm a fan for the sound we love the sound the deep low-end coming out with a perfect sound when you're talking about this kind of music is like walking a tightrope you want to have low-end and to get that you need clarity but too much clarity will make your sludge or doom metal record sound really tame really squeaky clean and weed eater has hit a sweet spot with this LP which isn't that much of a surprise considering the combined experience of all the guys in the band especially Dave Collins who's also been in groups like buzz of and bongs mellow which are great metal bands to check out if you're into the heavier side of this genre or high now if you're into scruffy filthy filthy music this thing is like plunging your head into a pool of filled with worms and rat carcasses and raw sewage usually in this style of music you get vocals lead vocals that are huge loud bellowing but Dave Collins has a voice that's more like a cat getting squeezed in a vice and I mean that in the most complimentary way possible unlike a lot of really really heavy slow brooding music it's like Punk it's instant its aggressive it's in your face you don't have to think about it you just get it you get what the point is even when these guys draw things out like on the title track of the album which is this six minute giant standing among all these two to three-minute dwarves the band really starts milking riffs but the album doesn't lose momentum but my biggest issue with this LP is something that has ruined a lot of albums over the course of history and that is filler most of the tracks here are loud not going to say they're not but still you've got an intro track you have a track that is kind of just a drum interlude you have a banjo piece kind of finishing the album off and a bonus track that is a piano solo and the song palm and opium would be a lot more interesting as maybe a one-minute kind of funny little gag ooh but as something that's longer than a lot of tracks on this album it's just way too long too much of a distraction and it's not really a good song and I'm not saying these guys aren't allowed to write quiet songs or acoustic songs they've done it before tracks like cure may alone willow but I would say even a track like alone is a much better song than some of the detours that this album takes I hate to come off callous like a total jerk but there's just like a handful of songs and moments here that I really don't care about on the heavier side of this album great sounds turn this thing up you get a lot of Rumble and a ton of highlights I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this album I think in the grand scheme of things this is a good good sludge metal album that should be listened to if you're fan of metal or if you're even curious about what the hell sludge metal has to offer what do you think of this LP do you love it do you hate it and what should I review next yeah any Fantana we need her Jason the TRACON forever 
vqcaYZSjJE0,Vidia different gear still speeding without really knowing what I was getting into I promised some people I would review this album so now I'm going to do that if you guys have done any research on this band I'm absolutely positively sure that you already know that this group is basically Oasis without Noel Gallagher kind of Oasis 2.0 but that would be kind of implying that there's like an improvement there it's kind of like Oasis version 0.5 since now it has less than it previously had but to keep things short and simple this is what I would call a stay at home album a stay at home album meaning that it's so bland and predictable in its style in its delivery that there's no possible way it would ever appeal go outside of the current away --ss and liam slash Noel Gallagher fanbase but it seems that the low expectations that people usually have for side projects like this were exceeded ever so slightly this time around but so what I don't care about music that sounds good in comparison to some of a band's discography I care about music that sounds good when you compare it to the world of music simply comparing this to Oasis past work and only that is small potatoes that I'm not interested in which is why this is a stay at home album it's good just as long as you don't leave the house and compare it to anything else if you're an oasis fan this isn't bad it's a clean produced approach to psychedelic and garage rock basically this Britpop revival stuff that has brought Liam to this point why would he just kind of cut and run just because he started a side project and honestly I'm sure this is the kind of music he likes some of the riffs and guitar work here are pretty good four-letter word Beatles and stones standing on the edge of the noise there's a nice boogie woogie piano on bring the light that I like and there's a very effervescent yes effervescent crescendo on the Morning Sun that I felt like you know had some merit to it but the whole thing comes off like a boring Li written Britt rock reader that just kind of makes this general assessment of mainstream rock coming out of the UK that blossomed during the 60s and 70s it's just safer vive ilysm it's a post Oasis project beating a dead horse I'm feeling like a decent two strong three on this thing it's certainly listenable but nothing that really got a rise out of me but that's just my opinion that's just my opinion and you know what I could be wrong I could be so I'm just going to give up any and all music for the next 30 years I'm only going to listen to this album and just you know let it grow on me grow and see what the result is [Music] Wow thirty years later and a regular exercise regimen and healthy diet have kept me looking relatively the same I am bald though and I've grown some stubble and I got to say thirty years ago my opinion completely wrong BDI the contribution they made to rock music on this album is greater than any other band has ever made in fact this thing makes every album on the face of the planet look like utter crap I would never ever want to listen to another thing again do you hear that you're oh boy I love this music this is great music you see this music over here this is great oh my gosh goes free music [Music] you 
Du53V0XRfGM,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and we're going to do something we haven't done in a while on the channel going to get back to the album review soon but we're going to do a question of the week AKA question of the whenever i feel like asking a question now if you're subscribed to the channel up there above my head it may say that this is my for Aundre video and it seems that some of you think that that is a milestone this is not my 400th video I've made way more than 400 videos it's just that a lot of my old videos which used to have copyrighted music in them because I used to do this and music would play youtube took those down but anyway in light of some albums that i have reviewed recently i would like to ask you the question growers what is a grower some people call albums growers why what exactly grows when you listen to the album does it grow when you listen to it the first time the second time if you listen to a song five times and it sounds different on the fifth time than it did the first what has changed is your perception of the song to me a grower for example would be grizzly bears a yellow house or maybe a godspeed album something that when you listen to it over and over and over it's kind of like an onion there are so many some people in the music you pick up on more and more of them as you listen repeatedly another way I see people using the term growers is to describe an album that you may not necessarily like the first time around and that oh wait wait wait no no no you should revisit it listen to in a million times more than you'll like it and I agree that has happened to me when I've listened to albums before I mean uh most recently the new pj harvey LP let england shake I didn't hate that album the first time around I just thought it was that it's okay it's all right when I first decided to take on the new PJ Harvey I didn't know who I was dealing with after glossing through this discography and listening to this album over and over until I figured out what I did like and what I didn't like about it I had come to the conclusion that there are more things I liked then I didn't like therefore I loved it but the thing is I've had the opposite effect occur with albums too I've really loved what I heard the first time around the new paper cuts LP was kind of like that for me but then again the more I listened to it the more I chewed on it I kind of discovered that there wasn't a lot there that would keep me coming back and enjoying the music even more with those albums be considered shrinkers the new yuck LP was a little bit like that for me too so is there such a thing as a grower does music grow or does your perception simply change based on the music that you're listening to and if that's true what about your perception changes how does your perception shift when you listen to music what albums in your opinion are growers what exactly grew on you when you listen to it hmm Anthony Fantana growers forever you 
hNmz05kGJgo,new mouth goes out hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd nerd nerd no nerd I hope y'all are doing well and I hope your teeth are brushed too we have to do an album review before that on the needle drop calm and audio track review of a track from the new papercuts album and also a new song from for Ted little bit alright so this is the new Mountain Goats album all eternals deck in the 90s singer/songwriter John Darnielle started the mountain goats by prolifically pumping out esoteric songs using nothing but his voice a guitar and a consumer-grade tape recorder it was low five before loaf I was even genre on the blogosphere it's a golden age that a lot of mountain goats fans complain is over because after one of my favorite mountain goat cell peas all hail West Texas John decided to take the project in the studio to get a more professional sound John's music got more ambitious conceptually - coming out with LPS that had really clear overarching themes like Tallahassee get lonely the sunset tree and one of his latest were John puts pretty much his religious side on display for all to see the life of the world to come and so now we have a new Mountain Goats album and for me every time the mountain goats drop in LPP I'm excited but yeah I'm also hesitant because it could be a triumph or a really rocky ride the thing is at the mountain goats core things really have not changed that's not necessarily a bad thing I like the fact that the mountain goats have stuck to the really simple chords and the poetic detailed storytelling what bugs me is that John has taken the project and is always kind of on the search for different ways to make his old shtick sound new by using different production techniques different effects different instrumentation using different side projects when to me the mountain goats are fine just the way they are without all the bells and whistles but I'm not going to say that venturing out hasn't led to success I mean it's led to a lot tracts that I love like dance music or maybe sprout wings and most of the songs on this album unlike the mountain goats more recent releases all turtles Dec does not have a really clear storyline running throughout all the tracks but still it's a solid set of songs and I'm going to start off with my favorite which is for Charles Bronson a track that's about just not being a spring chicken anymore and kind of coming to terms with that by trying to stay strong not letting other people see your weakness basically a story about accepting your waning relevancy although I do love the imagery that John pulls up in this track like holding the gun straight it's hilarious and yet inspirational and beautiful at the same time that track and a few others here to me are like classic mountain goats just really great stories simple instrumentation like the autopsy of Garland or even the ninth track here too and of course the mountain goats hit upon some new and different sounds here too some I question like the vocal effect on prowl great Kane I really really hate it it sounds so digital it's like John is singing through a PVC pipe but most of the new sounds here are great and just add some different flavors to the mountain goats Canon like the harmonized male backup vocals almost like barbershop vocals on high Hawkes season they sound so great I wonder why the mountain goats haven't done this before a state sale sign rocks really hard and and bitterly and you know the mountain goats usually aren't this loud in their songs they have been loud before but John's passion his vocal delivery just matches the volume of the music so it works and the age of kings outer scorpion squadron those tracks have some of the best string arrangements I've ever heard on a mountain goats album they're really getting good at adding instruments in without impeding on the song and I know I'm making a big deal about all the instrumentation here but for the most part this thing just has a rock-solid foundation of piano guitar bass drums nothing too out of the ordinary there are a few new surprises some familiar friends but overall this thing is just a set of solid songs no if this is going to please the old fans who hate the change that this project made in the studio but if you follow John Darnell over his past several albums I don't see why you wouldn't follow him here so if you like your music simple and your singer-songwriters complex Mountain Goats all Eternals deck this thing is going to squeak into the loved list with a light heat it's not exactly blowing my mind like it would have if all the songs linked together a little more clearly but the thing is a pocket of loose change is kind of in the same vein as a lot of old old Mountain Goats albums are so it's not like this kind of thing is unacceptable but if you've heard the album what do you think love it hate it why what should i review next and thanks for being awesome anthony Fantana the mountain goats forever 
Agg3HH0x_eA,miserable serious mode mosaic why hello there Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for an album review of the new serious mo LP mosaic down there in the D box we have an audio review of the new TV on the radio track and also links to follow us on Facebook Follow us on phone why because it's good for you serious mo is an electronic music producer hailing from Germany Europe's most German country even though this guy seems like a new face he's actually been putting out releases for over ten years it's just that up until this point his full-length debut he's pretty much been sticking to EPS there's new material here reworked favorites it's basically kind of like serious Mo's coming-out party where he shows everybody all the tips and tricks that he's learned over the years he's really all over the map on this thing making this album extremely difficult to describe in one word or pigeonhole I mean sure I could probably describe one track as being of a certain style but still the album as a whole is a genre hybrid that may not sit well with most people who don't like their electro touching their IDM and they don't want it anywhere near their dubstep my favorite track on the LP is the opener high together which kind of reminds me of justice if they had to buy all of their equipment at a Toys R Us not to say the sounds here crappy or anything like that it's the opposite the lows are really heavy booming the highs are crisp just all these synthesized sounds are so lush what I'm trying to say is that so much of what I'm hearing comes off playful bouncy colorful sure a lot of music here could be taken seriously as a dance tune but still serious mo isn't afraid to edit a little girl's voice into the track or play audio of people booing him there are a lot of moments here where I'm hearing a four to the floor beat something we're all used to but there are so many subtle he's flying by in the mix whether it be rhythms or just little glitches or flourishes of synthesizer there's enough variation to keep things interesting but it doesn't go so far that it makes this album feel like a science experiment some of the sounds here may be too indulgent for a dancefloor an American one but I could care less I'm still liking it tracks like sermon aid and bad idea pull out some bass programming which shows serious moe isn't afraid to mix ideas together because the beats and those tracks are a little too overbearing or experimental for them to be simply considered dubstep songs there's even a song here called signals with some really speedy melodies and dissonant chords here and there really reminds me of something I I would hear office square pushers first album there's one thing I can definitely say about this LP it's not too repetitive whether you're talking about what's happening in one song or the album as a whole in fact I think some people may complain that there isn't enough repetition I try to think of who's serious Moe wrote this music for and after thinking about the songs on this album listening to it again and again I mean he seems like the kind of guy who writes music for himself for his own amusement because he enjoys writing music it's like he couldn't care less about appealing to one single crowd which is why this album really lives up to the title mosaic but if I have to pull it apart there are some sounds here that weren't really doing anything for me like on track 15 the sampled female voice there really doesn't do much and on the song peeved there's a vocal there that sounds like a really bad Tom Waits impersonation plus there are a lot of tracks here that really are too short and not only are too short but don't develop fast enough or well enough to really leave a full impression it's kind of just like they blow by and they kind of become a blur within the hour of material that this LP holds but that's kind of the sacrifice here if you want to do a hundred different things but you only have so much time to do them in you're gonna have to you know cut them in it here cut them in it there I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing it's not a unique listen but fun listen a fun listen nonetheless links down there in the D box tell me what you think about this LP love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana serious smell mosaic forever 
6ZYy4gP1J3s,it's what it K oh my god Anthony Phan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd 20 the channel is so mainstream right now I'm just gonna you know give everything tens review the whole Beatles discography only review stuff that's on major labels I'm gonna change the color of the wall get a new wardrobe maybe call thom yorke and say hey dude you want to be my co-host and i'm gonna shave my mustache alright just so you know I've been getting a lot of requests to talk about this yoga album and I'm just gonna keep my opinion on it short and sweet Hyuk is a UK outfit who have been getting a lot of attention because of their 90s sound and I think it's a little lazy to slap an entire decade on this band especially since there are a lot of 90s groups they don't sound like and a lot of the inspiration for this album came from the late 80s who yuck sounds like depends on what song you're listening to from this LP because they don't really stick to one single idea on this album you've got J Mascis is fuzz doubt melodic guitar solos pavements bass lines and really rough production there are moments where the vocals sound like Yo La Tengo moments where they sound like Elliott Smith and the really twang down guitar interludes just scream modest mouse there's even a track here called shook down that sounds like a rocked out version of Galaxie 500s tell me um not a ripoff just kind of a reference point maybe yup just basically buffet pics from all of these sounds and styles and writes their music around them and yes there's a lot of revivalism going on these days and those bands that I said yuck sounds like represent a very important era in music but even after multiple listens to this album I fail to see the perspective that yuck brings to these sounds in other words whoo is this band because they spend more time sounding like other vans than they do themselves so you know on this one I'm gonna have to pull the originality card it's not something I do often if you guys watch the channel right particularly you know that I very rarely complain about originality in fact I think I praise more bands for showing their influences on their sleeves than I do finger-point like ghost Dumbo gets mad LCD soundsystem but I can easily make a separation between who those bands are and who they sound like to me when I listen to you that's a lot more difficult some of the songs here are decent like the opener suicide policeman the wall but the thing is all the music kind of makes me want to listen to the originators of that sound than it does make me want to revisit this album I'm feeling a strong v on this LP it's alright I'm really on the fence about it but that just goes to show what is exciting to you has a lot to do with what you've heard which means that I wouldn't necessarily say hey don't listen to this album stay away from it check it out for yourself chances are you already have I think this is a good LP to listen to if you're young too young to have lived through albums like bug and you're looking for a way to connect with this sound that King years before your time okay how do I look we look the same oh my god we look this not happening put this on your face you're gonna keep that on there until your thing is back I don't want to wear this there's no question about this that's on that's staying on alright okay Anthony Fantan oh yuck forever you hahaha 
-F1V2oPhlso,hmm hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for an album review hey new haircut you like it you like this oh hey looking sharp thanks Cal sometimes I sometimes I like Cal to Jesta down there in the D box some remixes on the needle drop calm that you could stream download show your friends show your mom whatever I don't care go check them out and also link down there is this mixtape which you can download for free the new fetch on mixtape higher learning vol 2 bath Shawn is a Fresno California rapper who's been tearing ass all over the mixtape circuit for a while now this is his tenth release one of my favorite rap albums of 2008 Boy Meets World and he has a new album supposed to be coming out this year next year not sure the ecology which is also titled after my favorite song on Boy Meets World which has really got me excited for what might be on it but still between its world and now this guy's been released in quite a few tapes and that's kind of kept me quiet kept me from freaking out and wondering where the hell the ecology is often hip-hop mixtapes don't have the best production the best mixing a lot of lifted beats all over the place usually a lot of features meant to just make connections and network in the hip-hop community so some inconsistency is kind of expected with over an hour of material on this thing the producers of this mixtape know that you're gonna pick your favorite songs stick to those which is why there are DJ Rockstar and ill will watermarks over every track Plus mixtapes can be a great place for artists to experiment with different sounds and just spit on beats you wouldn't we hear them spit up like the opening track here for Sean this beat that was built out of we are the champions by Queen and for me my favorite track on this entire thing is the higher remix wherever fashon spits on my favorite track from Kanye's new LP dark fantasy and in my opinion he kills it and he also does a little something over us papers which he kind of turns into a weed rap there's a wide range of sounds and styles all over this tape I'm not really a huge fan of some of the sugary moments here and a lot of the hooks kind of come off undercooked as much as I do like the verses on just another day nothing for the radio we'd rap big dreams the hooks there the choruses they just kind of seem like they are there and that's it they're not really enhancing the song for me but just kind of making this breaking point between the verses but still I admire the fact that no matter where you put the Sean he feels comfortable he sounds comfortable he's got a lot of versatility and I feel like that doesn't go appreciated enough to me it's like one of his biggest assets outside of his strong flow and personality on his past mixtapes there's always been a moment here a moment there that seems kind of out of character for him where he's either rapid about the club or spinning on a rock sound a pop sound and here he's not shy about that either actually I think he kind of ventures out of his comfort zone a little bit a bit more with a really heavy use of R&B hooks some acoustic guitars on the track catch me when I fall compared to his past tapes I think it's a little sweeter on the ears when I say sweeter I mean we've got more relationship tracks here more weed tracks here tracks about friends and family all bunched up together with what we're usually hearing from this guy which are songs about coming up in the rap game songs about overcoming the adversity of street life that's when Fushan hits me hardest and though I don't mind him venturing out of another territory that's just kind of what he does the best to me I love the song do what you got to do where he talks about just his drive his determination to make it big and not get caught up in material things or dealing drugs or crime and he sounds great bragging on a lot of the other tracks too to me this thing is really really front-loaded I do like the songs at the beginning of this thing a lot more than I do like them in the middle and the end but you know I'm not gonna look a gift horse in the mouth too much it's free don't take my word for it just listen to it yourself make your own decision if you like it you like it if you don't delete it like I said some of the beats here some of the hooks but as far as the Ryan's go for Sean to me sounds is hungry and as enthusiastic as ever I've been listening to some of his old tapes and he really sounds a lot more alive here than he has just two years ago something with a really strong beefy heavy ass six this thing is just really all over the place for me but I still highly respect for Sean as a rapper and that is in fact what I like the most about this album the rhymes I think if he keeps doing things the way he's doing them for Sean has a great future in hip-hop music I know once his next album drops which I'm really looking forward to and I'm

3-IGABC6rlU,PJ's Hurley bet England shakes yeah oh man oh man oh man oh man oh man oh man oh man I need a haircut I need to review this album I need to put up my radio show I have a lot of stuff I have to do today hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's sassiest music nerd and it's time for an album review I'm going to touch down on this new PJ Harvey LP let England shake before I get into this links down there in the D box to music on the needle drop calm some instrumental hip hop from Ayatollah and some very mind-bending psych rock from young circles now if you've been watching the comments section of my most recent videos you know people are asking about this but I was going to do it anyway I listen to music I can do things by myself but I waited and the reason I waited is because this thing is my first PJ Harvey album all the way through ooh shocker anthony hasn't heard everything so I was taking my sweet time digesting this and not only that but going back and listening to PJ's older stuff to just get a grip of who I'm dealing with here since PJ's springboard and off of her first LP her career has really been one of variety putting out albums like let's say is this desire or to bring you my love where it's not surprising to hear really moody quiet guitars on 1 track bunched up against really loud lo-fi drum machine beats on another track our more recent releases though PJ is really sticking to her guns still feeling explorative though by taking a sound and just venturing through it for the duration of an entire album and yeah that does go on here but still in the back of my head each song has a little bit something special about it that makes it stand out from every other one I guess I could say this album has an extremely extremely cohesive feel for me up there with like destroyers kaputt and there are several reasons why lots of lyrics about death war politics England as an institution and maybe how patriotism isn't all it's cracked up to be the production is pretty consistent to maintaining a kind of rough around the edges sound it's almost as if all of these tracks were recorded live maybe first take it all just feels so in the moment and yet there's all this instrumentation surrounding these songs so it couldn't possibly just been done on the fly I love the jangly guitars I love the sparse drums and for the most part on this entire album PJ sticks to the upper register of her voice just sounding really thin really nasally you don't get these dark guttural lows that you may have on her past LPS her voice on this album really reminds me of something like Bjork or Fever Ray would do so out of the 12 tracks here yeah there's some I don't like as much as others but for the most part they all hit me with a different reason for liking them which is why I really see myself coming back again and again and again to this album throughout the year I'm loving a lot of the lyrics here especially on the opener where PJ's things that England's dancing days are over and the way the song the glorious land sounds I just love the watery guitars they're in the primal drums and the way the song just builds and builds and moves in this linear fashion the male backup vocals and just chanting the mantras on the words that maketh murder plus I love the hook at the end of the song about the United Nations the instrumentation on that song really reminds me of like the Violent Femmes or Jonathan Richmond if he were in fact like dark and moody like PJ is here but the most beautiful moment on the album to me is the track England oh the escalating vocal melody on that song nice it's this LPS oh come Lee to me all in all I don't think this is an album that you really need to explain explain explain because what makes it good is just simple straightforward it's the fundamentals that make a lot of albums great just strong songwriting catchy hooks memorable melodies creative production it's a winning combination as far as gripes go they're really few and far between on this LP tracks like the opener I felt like could have used a little more contrast between their verse and their chorus and the song written on the forehead I really didn't like the watery vocal effects that they used on PJ on that track but you know I think our voice sounds great the way it is I'm loving it right now I don't see why it wouldn't grow on me more in the future I'm feeling like a strong eight to a light nine on this thing let me know what you think are you loving this are you hating this why especially all the people who are freaking out review PJ happy hmm I want to know what you think and that's the review y'all anthony Fantana PJ Harvey led England shake forever [Music] [Music] 
KtTU7nPAp5Q,Toro y Moi underneath the pine her petite derp derp derp her petite everybody Fantana near the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's album review time review review but a couple things before we get into this on the needle drop calm a new mixtape from fashon download that sh is linked in the d box along with a stream to the new dodd cult split you can hear the whole dot cult side really awesome black metal there and a review of a track in audio review of a track from the new bright eyes LP okay that guy said says mister Fantana when you can't please review the new Toro y Moi album underneath the pine I'd like to hear what you have to say I'd like to tell you what I have to say Toro y Moi is the solo project of multi-instrumentalist chaz bundok in 2009 he came out with the LP causers of this which got him a lot of attention but because that album is associated with the chill wave thing mess I keep thinking that it's from 2000 norm chill wave or no chill wave Toro y Moi is definitely shedding his old sound underneath the pine if any I'll remember my review from last year of causes of this I was pretty clear about what my problems with the album were so many of the tracks sounded great but just were kind of like unfinished ideas a lot of the vocals were just off which ruins some of the accessibility for me and it just didn't leave all that much of an impression on me now am I going to say that all of these problems have been eradicated on this album most definitely not but easily easily this thing puts causes of this to bed speaking of bed why aren't you in it you're reviewing music at 3 o'clock in the morning Darko this has been an error in continuity thank you for politely ignoring and refraining from comment on this error in continuity if there's any real contrast between this LP and Toros last it's that you know what the influence coming from the school of hip hop on that old LP has definitely dissipated a lot of the trippy and druggie sounds and effects to here Chas goes about 40 years back in time and starts grave-digging for disco beats and analog synth melodies and soft rock hooks and the way it's recorded really calls back to another time too with all these retro sounds flowing throughout this album I feel like this is kind of like listening to Ariel Pink's latest LP but with a much larger papa Pele and Chas has gotten really awesome at applying more arrangements to his music - which has really made me respect him as a musician the really awesome bass line on newbie the quirky guitar melody on go with you and the acoustic guitar woodwind combination on before I'm done all of it really impressive I guess the biggest issue for me on this LP is that I'm still not diggin the vocals all that much they are on pitch a lot more now than they were back then but the thing is Chaz is just not the most captivating vocalist in the world his voice just comes off really dreamy really sleepy and about half of the time he's burying himself under all of his production plus even though there's a lot of varying instrumentation throughout this entire LP the vocals because they feel so unchanging just give me this deja vu the sameness that really isn't helping the album for me I'm not going to say it's a bad thing what I'm going to say is that it's it's his thing the vocals don't offend me they just aren't gripping me all that much and as long as we're on the complaint train there are some tracks here that like on causers of this I felt like sounded really great just were fantastic ideas but just we're not fleshed out to the point where I felt like they reached their full potential like the really sexy song Davina Davina davana do overall I wouldn't chalk it up to being much more than a good listen a really really good listen it's just kind of in one ear and out the other for me though it's very likeable and pleasant while it's on this LP didn't blow my mind or leave a huge impression on me but it does have some really really strong singles I know I'm going to be praising the song newbie by the time I have to write out my 2011 lists I think some fans may be shocked a little bit by the change of sound on this album but overall for me everything that's wrong in waz albums before this had to offer has noticeably been improved improvement which is why I'm feeling like a you know like a light 7 on this thing strong 6 light 7 liking it but what are you thinking about this LP loving it hating it likin the new sound here miss chillwave I want to know and what should I review next anthony Fantana Toro y Moi underneath the pine forever [Music] this is not a pine 
0BFLDVGvTrQ,yes yes yeah everybody Anthony Fantan oh here the inter Nets busiest music nerd feeling fresh right now fresh fresh I got my Radiohead review done and now I'm looking forward to an entire week of bad ass reviews and we're gonna start Monday off with something off on this is the new Colin Stetson album new history warfare vol 2 judges obviously the follow-up to new history warfare vol 1 Stetson is a horn player not the first man to lay his mouth on a reed but an absolute beast basically this album is a series of solo horn pieces which are performed in single takes with no overdubs in the recording process of this album even though we're talking about one instrument here two dozen microphones were used to produce this thing these microphones are not only recording what's going on outside of the saxophone the sounds were usually used to hearing but also what's going on inside yeah you hear tones in these instrumental pieces but you're also hearing really weird wails inside of the instrument you're hearing the rhythmic percussion of the mechanics moving over and over and over you're hearing Colin breathing weird phantom noises that are impossible to describe and it all just does not stop and from what I've read in the press release for this album it's because Colin has mastered the circulatory breathing technique which I've never really heard put into words before but now that I go back and look up this technique and reference back to horn players that I like I have her used before but maybe just wasn't so conscious of it one of my favorite horn players having used it Roshan rolling to Kirk but anyway to hear Colin go on four two three four you in five minutes with no interruptions to me is just a technical feat but the thing is technical ability isn't everything there are plenty of albums with a lot of technical ability that come off kind of masturbatory because the sound of the music suffers at the hand of the flashiness but I don't feel that here not for one second outside of Stetsons abilities here I'm really enjoying the the sounds the production just the quality of this album and the music the compositions themselves though very repetitive progressed and evolved really nicely really beautifully at some points there are a lot of moments here where I'm not even thinking of this music as horn music the combination of really warm tones the repetition the percussion that you're hearing from the inner workings of the sax are mixed together so well it sounds like electronic music to me judges the title track home Red Horse fear of the unknown and Blazing Sun all these moments sound like that to me it's one instrument but with the way the microphones are placed and the way this thing is mixed it's like you're hearing three or four different instruments at once but there still are a lot of moments here where you know it sounds like a saxophone it doesn't feel like you're inside of the instrument it sounds like maybe you're the the one person sitting inside a gigantic empty Hall and Collins sounds are just bouncing off of every stone wall in the building I'm just making this cavernous endless echo there are some moments here several moments where Lori Anderson pops in to do some spoken word Laurie freakin Anderson Shara Worden or my brightest diamond shows up and does some vocals too on here on the track Lord I just can't keep from crying sometimes really pained and soulful on that thing's Colin plays these non-stop ominous drones in the background it's really eerie my one gripe about this LP is that some of the tracks here do me and ER a little bit after a lot of listens and eventually the technical sexiness of this album does wear off but the songs or the melodies the chord progressions the sax runs just the compositions that Colin puts together on here reveal themselves some are more stunning than others but they're all pretty beautiful to observe but if you're looking for an album that will take all of your preconceived notions of the saxophone and horn playing and burn them to the ground and then rebuild a new joyous city where anything is possible then this thing listen to it I'm feeling a strong eight on this thing I ordered the vinyl copy from constellation records I'm really looking forward to this thing arriving in the mail give a listen to this link down below in the de box where you can hear three tracks from it let me know what you think do you love it do you hate it why do you think in fact that this is a little masturbatory maybe a little too indulgent or did it kind of blow your mind like it did mine let me know what you think I should review next and one final thing I want to say before I close out this review is you know what just um just thanks for watching thanks for commenting thanks for thumbing up all my videos just thanks for subscribing thanks for just you know being really consistent in in watching and just caring and supporting what I do I really appreciate it um it means a lot that you guys I guess take my opinion seriously when I say an album is good and you know don't get too upset with me when I don't like something that you may necessarily like that means a lot to me and it makes me feel like doing this as is fun so yeah once I'm okay that's that's it um anthony Fantana Colin Stetson forever 
FnfNcqX5AAA,King of Limbs no no fine John hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd about to embark on an album review of the new Radiohead LP their eighth album the King of Limbs though yes I was going to review this eventually in light of recent comments death threats messages emails mail bombs and this plus I'm positively absolutely sure anything I review or touch down upon until this review is finished will be completely ignored poor Nicolas jar hardly do you well everyone here already knows who Radiohead is I hope so if you don't I recommend this fantastic thing called the Internet it's this global interconnected system of computer networks that people use to access information porn sites and viral cat videos you can also use it to find out about Radiohead so they drop the King of Limbs this past Friday and it's caused a lot of chatter like why is this thing just over 30 minutes when we're usually used to hearing these guys string out albums for longer periods of time and also why did it take them just almost four years to follow up in rainbows with eight tracks several of which have been around kicking around either in a live capacity or a studio session capacity like morning mr. magpie plus a ton of theories about a sequel or a second part to this album coming out eventually has been circling discussions about this LP - all I know is that I really don't have answers to any of this stuff and that we will just have to wait and see where the cards fall can you just not do that all I really know about this LP is what I've heard and I'm just going to give you my opinion not going to mince words if there's any noticeable change between the King of Limbs and in rainbows it's the really aggressive use of loops and samples I'm not necessarily saying Radiohead is lifting source material from other things it sounds like they recorded these parts themselves but are looping them with a sampler or sequencer or something I do like the sounds on this album though sonically to me bloom the opener here is the most impressive of all the tracks with the really crisp beat the warm bass those synthesizers and with all of these instruments that to me sound a little bit like maybe a jazz fusion band filtered through this electronic lens it really reminds me of something I might hear from for tetes albums before he came out with there's love in you or maybe flying lotuses cosmic Ram I've heard people throwing that comparison around and after thinking about it a bit yeah I definitely see that especially considering that Tom did collaborate with him on a track on that album things on Bloom get even more beautiful as the song progresses with these horns and these strings just swelling in and just sort of swooping into the mix I guess I would say and it's just pure ear candy for me at that point I do like the sounds but my issues with the LP kind of lie with how they are organized or mixed or even perfume you could take the first three tracks of this album as an example the looping percussion and maybe some other sounds to could be reverse guitar something else all of these you know like I said sound nice but especially on bloom magpie oh when I hear these sounds repeating over and over and over and over for nearly the entire length of the track with little to no interruptions how good they sound is like irrelevant to me it's just like oh man I just wish something would change because even though bloom again for example you've got these really nice sounds layering themselves over the track and introducing themselves there's still this constant reminder that snare rhythm playing over and over and over and over like hey even though they're these new sounds here things really are changing I do have a big issue with little by little though in terms of sound just the other really tinny percussion on there it sounds like the samba demo that you would hear on a consumer-grade keyboard you know just push the button here that Samba beat it's just so fruity loops to me and I'm not digging it at all but I will say there are moments where the loops and the repetitions work I will say the first moment they do is on Farrell we're just kind of venturing into every nook and cranny of the key and tempo that it's in and repetition isn't necessarily a bad thing but the amount of repetition here isn't complemented with a proper amount of variation to actually make you feel like you're going somewhere the track lotus-flower breaks that mold for me a lot though it's a really great tune I think it's the strongest one here and I love the way the chorus swells with the keyboards and the drums in fact do change a little bit in the background it's not the same beat throughout the whole song I kind of wonder why other tracks didn't get that treatment and also in terms of the chorus again it is just eargasm ik when tom hits those highs a couple of ballets here to codex being my favorite I just love the piano sounds the horn and strings that introduce themselves later into the song it's just a nice break from all the beats and if there's one thing Tom can do so consistently it is set a painful atmosphere and all in all it's kind of haunting but maybe just didn't leave the impression that I wanted it to I really hate to say it I do but I feel like uh Radiohead's previous efforts are so much more powerful to me and I don't even need to go back to the classics to say that I mean I could go back to in rainbows I remember the first time I heard the song nude I almost cried to me that track alone smokes everything here for breakfast take the songs pyramid lucky everything in its right place I am like you I want to feel powerful just emotional moments like this again and I'm looking for him here but I really feel like I'm sifting through a basket of bruised fruit now is this a terrible album but I think me like many people were expecting a little more from Radiohead on this thing and I don't mean just in terms of length even if Radiohead does come out with another version a sequel something like that it's not going to change the fact that there are a lot of songs on here that just underwhelmed me to me this album just could have been awesome if it just had the same attention to detail that in rainbows did so you know what I'm feeling like a light - decent six on this album I'm liking it but nowhere near loving it I don't even see that light at the end of the tunnel it sucks because this is my first Radiohead album review I wish it could be more exciting or positive but that's it I'd like to say sorry to Sami sorry to the Radiohead fan boys also I'd like to say God bless Radiohead god bless the King of Limbs god bless the newspaper version that's going to come out in may God bless the second half of this album that might or might not come out I'm going to go get hit with this bat now okay you all have a good day Radiohead the King of Limbs Anthony Fantana forever you 
Pc5Hutyj2AA,Nicholas char space only noise okay hi everybody Anthony Phan tanto here Internet's where my sleeves rolled up busiest music nerd and we're going to do an album review the new Nicholas jar album space is only noise first off I want to say I'm sorry because I didn't even post on the website yesterday I just was not feeling well um a lot of sinus problems impacting my ears and my nose it sucks but I'm feeling a little better now and before we get into this I want to plug two people talk about two peeps number one Jonathan Mann on YouTube he has a channel where he does a song a day and I came across this guy's channel because he wrote a song sort of dedicated to all the people who were either really mad or really confused about Arcade Fire winning Album of the year like who the hell is Arcade Fire and I'd also like to plug and Edie you guys may remember that I talked about him in one of my previous videos and I really don't feel like I gave his LP the justice that it deserved not that I'm in love with the album that I lied about not liking it but I just didn't explain why I didn't like it well enough or even explain as to what kind of music fan may be interested in it I'm just going to link a music video down there in the d box from and Edie even over here if you click on this you can watch it it will explain everything okay Nicolas jar is a New York electronic music producer he's been putting out EPS pretty regularly for the past several years but this is the first I'm hearing of him with this debut full-length album a needle drop of mine you know who you are ever since she introduced me to this I've been kind of soaking it in it's been taking a while for me to figure out how I feel about this because it is a heady piece of work and it's hard to label this LP as being any one thing really this album is part minimalist techno part ambient sound skate part sample-based sound collage part field recording what flavor you're getting really depends on what track you're listening to uh it's kind of like a mixtape you might make for a really really really weird girl who you're attracted to but still even though there's a lot of variation among these songs they all find a way to either blend or fade into one another kind of making this a really cohesive listening experience for some standout moments let me say Nikolas can really twist some knobs here let's look at the title track it seems like this song along with a lot of songs on this LP are hits set for the planets darkest dancefloors you've got Nico's voice or what I think is a Nico's voice just mumbling bouncing with echo and sounding really deep and dark and ominous when the beat hits it is like pure pure ecstasy really fat obese synthesizers and more and more rhythms popping up as the song progresses more effects are coming up the bass is swelling in the background it really kind of reminds me of the atmosphere surrounding Matthew dears black city and in another way kind of reminds me of Pantha do prints in that on the surface it seems really repetitive really minimal but once you take the plunge and just dive your head into this thing you see a lot more subtlety than you did the first time around there are a few other tracks that kind of follow this formula as far as other songs like the intro the outro a bunch of tracks peppered in between there are a lot of sample vocals and found sounds like really weird clicks and textures water the sound of people laughing talking kids playing mouth noises like and it's all set to really dark synthesizers or piano but it's not like all the samples here just create you know these filler tracks that you're just going to kind of breeze by when you actually get the album in your hands there are a lot of spots here like with horns and even the voices themselves that actually build the song like on I gotta I mean I hear this man's voice it couldn't possibly be Nicholas's it sounds like some kind of blues man singing about his woman but he takes this one section of him singing and repeats it over and over and over why all this clipped instrumentation rises underneath it it's really fantastic how Nicholas basically takes these sounds and plays them like they're an instrument this album may come off as something that's trying to be like too deep for you too out there too weird but there are a lot of accessible and beautiful and gorgeous moments here it's just that many of them I would say maybe all of them do not hit right away Plus this LP isn't exactly straightforward with what its intent is even after all the times I've heard it I'm not even sure what the point is all I know is that I'm enjoying it I'm hit by a lot of great grooves here I love the synthesizers the textures that flow throughout this album I'm finding a lot of haunting melodies a lot of great and creative uses of samples and a really really dark atmosphere I feel in a decent - strong 8 on this thing it gets kind of repetitive in the end especially when you start hearing a lot of the voices that you heard in the beginning used over-order plus I kind of wish there were a few more moments here like the title track but overall that's how I'm feeling on this thing what did you think of it if you got a chance to hear it I blogged about it way earlier this month I would love for you guys to hear the title track down there in the D box I know there's more of this album out there on YouTube I'm sure are you loving it hating it why I know I'm loving it and I would love for you to love it too Anthony Fantana Nicholas jar space is only noise forever [Music] look 
FGaO0divFf0,last time on the needle drop I got it I got it I got the radiohead leak you do what's the bit rate ed today it's a damn it man subs are hanging in the balance it's 96k mother fripp was the greatest thing King Crimson had going for them to suggest otherwise is a heap of bullsh orona my Sharona yeah this was the worst thing I had ever heard of my life until I heard this and now your riveting conclusion to the needle drop right now momentarily injustice Lee I'm not really a big fan of this thing and Ed songs in the key of magic it's ok it's got some funny parts maybe if you're in the market for a comedy album maybe he's really fun to see live you know it's decent whatever let's um I don't know let's review another album oh I wonder what I'm going to review next ooh jazz jazz jazz jazz I hope it's jazz jazz jazz jazz jazz jazz jazz jazz jazz I never get to reuni jazz breed is a metal band from Norway believe it or not and they've been around since 2004 but they're by no means noobs the members of this band originally came from windier who broke up sadly after the tragic death of their lead singer and breed you could say they're a black metal band I mean they certainly are influenced by that sound they have the look but that's not the only thing that influences them on their fifth album titled V which means 5 some people might call this a perversion of black metal or an alteration of that sound but I don't see it that way to me it's more like a Hommage to the genres roots when in the 90s all of these nordic bands are being highly influenced by this rising tide of thrash metal in the West which is the air of these guys come from anyway so if anybody knows that influences there it's them the retched vocals and the blast beats that were used to hearing in this kind of music are here but most of the time the chugging riffs the ultra melodic and technical solos the flashy drums are what stealing the show another thing that separates this LP from most black metal albums I would say even reads other albums are the use maybe the overuse of interludes on this album now this is not the first time these guys have done something like this they've definitely dabbled in that sound before like on 2007's I Craig which was the first time I had ever heard cowbell in a black metal album obviously these guys are not afraid to experiment to fuse things together there are even some riffs on this album that kinda reminded me of motörhead sometimes the drums even March a little and on my favorite track slave the drums even sound like they should be really in a pep rally as opposed to a metal album now one side of me sees the riffs and the instrumental passages and the clean vocals and just you know wanders in my head should these really be here should they should they be here meanwhile another side of me is admiring the hell out of these guys for really with the rules they're clearly writing music that they love music for themselves and that passion pours out into the energy behind these songs the production is great the guitar playing is pretty good too the chords the melodies the solos are all really righteous the vocals are powerful but I do have a big gripe with this LP and we have to go back to what I mentioned earlier the interludes nearly every song on here has one and some pull it off better than others the opening track is a great example of that but those who like their black metal or even just their metal in general hard and fast and hard and fast and hard and fast and hard and fast and hard and fast maybe kind of bored by some of the slower moments here plus their songs here that really lose momentum once they break into the instrumental bridge especially when the instrumental the interlude whatever you want to call it stretches beyond the point of being so it kind of becomes the entire song that's how long some of these get plus a lot of these changes from one section of the song to the other are all that graceful or seamless though some people like a hard abrupt shift but if you're in the market for a metal album that refuses to play into stereotypes fuses a lot of different genres together with some great sound energy and musicianship then breed 5 in my opinion just a lot of it could have been organized better sure you have a lot of these different parts inside of a song but they don't necessarily come together into a thematic or cohesive unit I fail to see how a lot of these sections really I'm feeling like a strong six or maybe a light seven on this thing a lot of memorable and worthwhile tracks here for sure check out the the single from this LP link down there in the d'box there's a music video for it it's pretty badass and yeah what do you think about the state of black metal today heavy question thank you for watching what should I review next keep being awesome Anthony Fantana read forever you you 
rcz78ic8CGw,do-do-do-do-do little be angels Exodus and and Edie Britt wait wait wait wait hi everybody Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd we're going to do an album review of the new little BLP angels Exodus before I get into this linked in the D box new music from timber timber and monster rally check it check it out I've been toying with this idea in my head for the past few weeks the double feature of veil and it's basically kind of where I do a video where I talk about two albums that I don't really like all that much and title it the double feature of it I'm just going to test it out don't know if I'm gonna make it a thing you know this whole double feature of food many of you may already know little B as a California rapper a member of the pack and I've had a run-in with him too on the song I'm Miley Cyrus now when I reviewed that track a lot of people were pissed off because I didn't hate it enough and the fans didn't like it either because I didn't point out one of his good tracks and I'll agree the guy has good songs but I'm not going to point him out you got to do what I did sift through about 20 different Miley Cyrus's to find one well little B recently dropped a new album angels Exodus I saw there were 12 tracks here I thought I was bound to run into a good one so why not try it but that just didn't happen in the way that I hoped it would I will give it to this LP it does get better as you progress through it especially on the tail end of this thing with the bonus tracks where little B is right in the beat you know like a real rapper now I will admit I have not heard all of little B's stuff obviously I'm still alive but I've never heard this guy saying which he does a little bit here especially on the all my life remix and I gotta say he sounds like an angel laying on a bed of nails with a 300-pound man tap-dancing on him honestly when little bee is even coming off serious I feel like I'm getting trolled with the bad vocal mix and lyrics like monkey see monkey do you look like me I look like you I'm a vampire now I'm a vampire now and it only gets worse with the bad vocal mix and they're really cheap tinny beats and speaking of the beats I have no clue why they're such a focal point for fans of this album yeah he samples Janelle Monae washed out some soul on here you're gonna sped up Evanescence track and yeah I guess it's kind of interesting that he sampled this music but is it that amazing that he listens to it he is a twenty-something with access to the Internet this is the musical diet of a lot of 20-somethings with access to the Internet now in terms of rapping in terms of just the sound of the beat uh this album sounds pretty good on one time or more silence more coffins but for me it's like too little too late dude I'm not going to sift through the first seven tracks of this before you actually start handing me stuff that's okay now I want to make it clear I do not hate little B and I don't begrudge the guy his popularity and I agree with one thing that people say that is so great about him and that is that he's genuine he's real I feel that's true when little B says he's hurtin he's in pain he's suffering the world sucks people are fake he has haters people are out to get him I believe him for the most part I believe him he has emotions he has feelings just like me just like you we're all human my issue is that I don't see him sculpting that emotion into anything interesting or clever he's definitely real and the rap game could use a lot more reality these days but the problem is there are a lot of up-and-coming rappers who are real but bring much better production and rhymes to the table now part of me is definitely entertained by this even by the songs I don't like but it's mostly in a low-budget horror movie with bad acting kind of way plus we're all the Woo's we're all the swags I can't - this never mistake knowledge for wisdom and this is angels Exodus are hardly a replacement for women swag I'm feeling a strong - - a light 3 on this thing I was you know just very very very mildly entertained by several songs on it most of them just I didn't like at all so let me know you're thinking of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and yeah we've got to keep going because this is a double feature of okay and Edie he's the kind of guy who if you feel like an outcast in society because of your mullet your rat tail your bleached denim jacket and your beer-bellied he's going to make you feel a lot less lonely in this world his new album songs in the key of magic doesn't just flip the bird to modern music it also dry hump sit on the dance floor among a bunch of empty beer bottles with a disco ball spinning overhead long story short it's really gimmicky electro rock rap with lots of lyrics about unicorns Viking love coming singing rubbing my butt on your junk rubbing your junk on my butt Anthony come quick something terrible's happening to the tree they're on finger and then they're gonna hump me oh my god [Music] [Music] 
4DsiwriEgBE,Mogwai art core will never die maybe ah finally a chance to review the new Mogwai album hardcore will never die but you will before we get into this review down there in the D box check out a new track from Beach fossils that you can download and also a music video from a black metal band who I hope to be reviewing their latest LP this week their name is Reid hope I'm pronouncing that correctly it's pretty badass melodic BM oh yeah let's get into it Mogwai is a Scottish band who just celebrated their 15th year together with an awesome live LP called special moves that you really should check out if you have the time to check it out you should this thing is Mogwai seventh LP and they're really one of those groups who's kind of plagued by their groundbreaking debut album unfortunately pretty much every comment about the album's released after 1997 s young team go a little bit something like this yeah it's good but young team is way better and this album is already suffering that fate - unfortunately and it's okay if you like one more than the other that's fine we all have preferences but I'm here to say that the assumption that Mogwai no longer has it is bullsh more or less Mogwai has always been relegated to the genre of post rock but to me this is the most conscious effort to move in a different direction rather than basing their instrumental rock songs on really soft interludes and loud crescendos they're being pretty straightforward with their volume this time around but hardcore will never die is still a complex challenge - the attention span because instead of hitting you over the head with a loud change in volume oh it's changing here you go it's really obvious hey Mogwai subtly layers more guitars drums synthesizers and effects into a pre-existing groove kind of creating this layer cake every song here evolves it's just dependent upon you to take the plunge and just realize how much evolution takes place even on the simplest shortest track here San Pedro these heavy beefy guitar riffs getting down stroked and then this other guitar flies in on the right channel there's another guitar in the background getting tremolo picked all these guitar parts are morphing and changing and then the whole song breaks down into halftime making it almost mobile kind of wanted to bring the mosh obviously this track like a lot of tracks on this LP is a lot more straightforward than Mogwai usually is and these guys have made attempts at this before but this track has way more subtlety way more interesting stuff going for it that I just did not hear on some tracks on for example the hawk is howling like Sun smells too loud or back cat even though if we do go back to mr. B's classic Omega snake ah yeah Mogwai is definitely simplifying or compacting their formula and they're sounding really good doing it they're really not milking every single moment like they used to one production move I question though are the vocoder vocals on George Square Thatcher death party though I did like the vocals on Mexican grande Quan and speaking of Mexican Grand Prix the pumping bass line on that track the really constant drums the repetitive phrases can somebody say krautrock it sounds like Mogwai has been digging on a lot of noise and Harmonia to pull that kind of thing off and in light of the sound of Mexican Grand Prix that whole same volume subtle layers approach is really what kind of feeds this entire album it's another really consistent release for me in the Mogwai canon each of their albums kind of have a certain theme or a certain idea and I feel like the idea this time around is just making that Mogwai sound just more in-your-face though there's still are some moments here where you know I felt like it could have used a crescendo or it could use the point where it got quiet like the opener I'm feeling a light eight on this album enjoying it a lot enjoying it a lot every time I listen to it if you're in the market for an instrumental rock album full of really mesmerizing jams and grooves that just build and build and get thicker and thicker and louder and louder than BAM hardcore will never die but you will anthony Fantana Mogwai 
zzmpVAXSd9Y,[Music] it's track review hello everybody Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd hope y'all are doing well at the very start of this week a lot of things that are worth reviewing a lot of things that are worth covering plus the announcement of something dropped new Radiohead LP new Radiohead LP this month February 19th that should be a good review that should be a good album or it'll just be okay and then I'll review it and give it an OK score and then people freak out and say either way it'll be a good time also yesterday I uploaded a Valentine's Day video that featured my girlfriend we named off five love songs that we like each and I don't know why it's at 240p I uploaded it at 7:20 it's not high quality I'm sorry it's not but still the list of 10 songs still stands we love those tracks love songs we love go check it out linked in the D box okay so I've been getting comment after comment after comment after comment after comment to review this song the new Tyler the Creator track yonkers from his forthcoming LP goblin which is due out this spring and what's actually crazy Odd Future Wolf Gang kill them all they're going to hit it big man they're going to play on Fallon this week this track and one more are going to hit iTunes tomorrow expecting some big things also before we get into this review I want to say good job Arcade Fire good job good job alright so let's listen to Yonkers it's linked down there let's see what it's got to offer [Music] all right let's talk about what I don't like about this song first because there's more I do like what's really killing this track for me is the beat is it terrible no but could there be a lot more done with it to improve it yes it sounds like something straight out of GarageBand I like the weird samples in it like the but it's so rigid and so flat the drums are really flaccid in the bass feels so hollow it's just not bumpin it's just so mmm it's like chewing on cedar it's like chewing on tinfoil it's like chewing on styrofoam overall it's just really hollow and repetitive and I'm not really digging at all that much but what it does do I have to give it that is set a nice dark foundation for the lyrics that Tyler spits over the thing on Tyler the creators last album bastard I really felt like I was catching kind of two sides of him on that LP this really angry angsty teenager side and this really scary psychotic weirdo side sometimes of course they blended together but I like that here on goblin I'm catching more of that psycho side and he does it right out of the gate when he says I'm a flock in paradox no I'm not he references Reptar The Flintstones Stevie Wonder playing football even goes back and references his therapist from the album bastard and goes as far as to mention Columbine in the same breath as he does the cartoon adventure time but overall his flow sounds better than ever maybe the wrasse penis of his voice feels maybe a little forced but still it's not something I'd hold against him he's not only reminding me of eminem when he used to be dark and moody but also old dirty bastard because he kind of goes into this weird sack Kokila Norman Bates kind of mode when he starts rapping and I like that a lot also uh you know MF DOOM - I'd say a little bit definitely that darkness that eccentricity though Tyler comes off way more aggressive violent kind of freakish at three minutes and five seconds I'm still kind of left wanting more on this track but from what I hear the iTunes version that's going to drop this week should be longer not sure what I kind of shell out dough for this track by itself not particularly it's it's alright not amazing me I do think things can get better from here but will it sound more badass sandwiched in between all the tracks on goblin once it gets released this spring we'll find out this thing's definitely an advancement past what I've heard on bastard but we're not talking night and day we're talking like night and Dawn overall feeling like a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing it's good it's good but I want to know what you think about it do you love it do you hate it why what do you think of Odd Future Wolf Gang kill them all are they legit rap group are they too young are they a spectacle are they just trying to get a rise out of people hmmm-hmmm anthony Fantana tyler the creator Yonkers Goblin free Earl Arcade Fire Radiohead forever [Music] you

HAaEjb9l180,natural child hello everybody it's anthony Fantan oh the needle drop oh yeah somebody turned that into a dance mix please all right time for an album review before we get into this I want to mention on the needle drop comm check out a track from the upcoming colin stetson album i'm going to be reviewing it it's going to drop februari 22nd on constellation records I'm really excited for it I think it's gonna be a great great LP for sure and also for you people who are huge fans of that new James Blake album or even people who hate that James Blake album you may be very interested in an article I found on said the gramophone linkedin the d'box very interested very very interested now before we trip into next week and hit up a ton of highly anticipated album reviews I want to get a little sutton sutton out of the way talk about something that i found just this week on one of my favorite blogs everybody taste check those guys out now this is a release you could say is beautiful on the inside and the outside because seriously scope this babe scope this babe the shades the the hair motorcycle pet snake look if you're watching that's you this is you this thing has recently been reprinted by infinity cat records for songs five if you go digital and this whole thing this whole release is nothing but hard-nosed rock and roll the guitars are rough and filthy and sharp and distorted and the drums are simple but very ballsy and the vocals bring what I feel the most important element of this EP is personality I know on this channel I harp a lot about personality and to me it can make or break your record if you act and talk and sound like a hundred other people that I know I'm probably not going to remember your name next time I see you at a party I'm sorry but if I ran into these dudes at a party at my be one of the wildest nights of my life filled with screwing people I don't want to skipping town riding trains smoking crack with my friends and cougars not the most wholesome of activities and maybe pretty awful while you're doing them but they all may make pretty funny stories 10 or 20 years down the road after all the scars have healed but the CP isn't just about funny odd or angry lyrics there are a lot of great hooks here too so many good hooks that I kind of wonder why these guys don't have more stuff released so many things on this just stick out in my head like the catchy quick guitar line on the track crack mountain with a little bit of reverb on it just to make it stand out past the muddiness the floor tom romp on Cheyne walk or the messy group vocals on the track dog bite it's like the muscular songwriting of Jay Reatard mixed with the classiness of GG Allin overall feeling a light aid on this really enjoying it bought it myself proud to have listened to this and say that I really like it but this may not be for you if you're not into something that's abrasive in-your-face kind of wild and crazy there are bands like people who are too insane to want to hang around with however I'm pretty sure these guys are joking more than they are serious when they sing about being out all night and coming home at 3pm to your angry dad and you just tell them what I've been smoking crack with my friends I've tracked from this thing up at the needle drop calm these guys have more songs from the 7-inch on their myspace check them out tell me what you think love it hate it why and stay sexy what do you think I should review next week so many good LPS which should I talk about first which one which one Anthony Fantana natural child 7-inch forever you what 
6YjqJdoHUZM,it's track review yeah hi everybody Anthony Phan tanto here the Internet's checking the time busiest music nerd and this is track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music and whether or not it's good yes now many of you may be asking yourselves hey Anthony that new strokes single came out why are you reviewing it I already have it's on the needle drop calm audio review I just kind of wanted to do it you know audio style I wanted to get it up the day that it came out go listen to it over there link in the d box plus I've been reviewing too much stuff that's you know requested lately let's do some stuff that you know I kind of want to turn you on to that cool and if you don't like it tough so let's talk about this thing the band is an Amana Gucci this is their latest single airbrush or their latest physical single rather these guys are in New York band and a lot of people would lump this act into the chiptune set now if you don't know what chiptunes are go to the website 8-bit people's and come back these guys are doing big things right now they have been credited for writing the soundtrack to that Scott Pilgrim movie and last year they came out with a series of free digital singles that were a huge hit with their fans one of the tracks actually ended up on my favorite songs of 2010 list now starting this March March first they're going to be releasing physical seven inches some I imagine are some of those summer tracks they released last year but maybe there will be some new stuff in there I don't know all I do know is that the first single will be the first single they released last summer airbrushed let's give a listen to it link down there see what it's got to offer good times wow-wow-wow-wow-wow- wow-wow I think at this point in their career I can honestly say that I'm in love with this band when these guys dropped their debut album a while back I heard it I thought it was okay it was fun it had a nice little you know web series of animations going along with it that made it you know really interesting to listen to but still it didn't impress me then as much as it is now at this point what I like so much about automata Gucci is that they are smashing just smashing all preconceived notions about 8-bit music it's not just for dorks anymore but seriously anybody who appreciates rock music can appreciate this these guys really make that chiptune 8-bit sound accessible by of course fleshing it out with rock instrumentation guitars drums you could look at it like that or you can see it as a rock band adding something unique to make them sound different from their contemporaries that unique thing being those 8-bit tones either way the equation adds up to a huge win here in an instrumental track that has the righteous melodies of the champs and the party all night attitude of Andrew W K does this thing starts off with no BS whatsoever pumping drums distorted guitars just layers of 8-bit sounds and it's really good confidence this thing blares at you but it's mixed and produced really really well though it is loud it's easy to pull apart and make sense of what's going on when the first burst of sound in this song kind of you know pans out fades away you get this lead melody coming in against the drums that sounds a little bit like that pains of being pure hard track comes Saturday but only for a second because after that it jumps in to the next idea and that's another thing I dig about this track it's constantly in a state of change and/or flux but despite that it's really easy to get off the bat it's highly accessible this thing takes electronics and makes them rock the bow it's just got great production memorable melodies detailed songwriting great attitude aside for my guests that maybe some people would see this music as being very cheesy very corny I can't say one bad thing about it I'm feeling like a strong friggin nine on this thing I'm enjoying the hell out of it and I can't wait to see what other seven inches these guys put out later this year so look for this thing once it gets released physically it's supposed to have a crazy-ass 3d cover so uh mm-hmm March 1st I'm waiting what do y'all think of this track what do y'all think of 8-bit music chip tunes love it hate it love this hate this why and what do you think I should review in the far-off future when you know I get tired of reviewing stuff that I want to review which will probably be maybe Monday or Tuesday Anthony Fantana on a mana Gucci forever 
Qqw9bnffDsY,chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga - to check a chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga to to check the Cheka Cheka Cheka Cheka Cheka Cheka Cheka - - hey everybody all aboard the hype train our destination today is the new James Blake LP James Blake because he's not just a man he's also an album ooh what if I came out with an album called Anthony Fantan Oh what if somebody else beat me to it so mr. Blake is a UK electronic music producer who came out with a string of EPS last year that got him a lot of buzz and I didn't review them because I was busy reviewing other stuff doing laundry so I've played this LP again and again and again and believe me it's not that hard it's just 38 minutes and I think I can say easily that this is the perfect winter album it's chilly but still displays a lot of warmth and humanity like Frosty the Snowman on a more serious note this thing is more like staring at an ice sculpture a beautifully crafted ice sculpture but what is it an ice sculpture of I'm not sure it's most definitely not a swan and this may be an issue that some people have with this album that it doesn't really take a definite shape or form but that hasn't necessarily ruined my enjoyment of it as I was listening to this thing again and again and again one of my favorite albums the thought of it just kept recurring in my head Laurie Anderson's big science and I'm not going as far as to say Blake is a huge fan of that album or even hugely inspired by it but most definitely the vocoder vocals the linear song structures the swelling electronics the abstract lyrics all of it kind of had me thinking Oh Superman in the back of my head a lot of the time and as many of you already know Blake steps up to the microphone on this album surprises a lot of fans and sings pretty much this entire LP even going as far as to sing backup for himself on many of these tracks and to me his voice kind of sounds like a cross between Bon Iver and Antony and the Johnsons I'm comparing this to a lot of heavy musicians out there but I don't want to make this thing seem like a science experiment because it's not actually one of my favorite things about this album is how amazingly Blake balances procedure and emotion the track Wilhelm scream is a perfect example I love the lyrics there they're kind of vague but tell a very relatable story about James kind of being unsure about his love and his dreams and it sounds like he's just ready to give up everything because of that and when he says might as well fall in fall in it's like he's just giving up on life he's over he's done and as the production builds into this fuzzy blurry wall of sound it's like you're falling with him or at least that's kind of the feeling that I got now aside from the emotion and the experimentation there's one more thing that I really liked about this album and it's that it kept me guessing pretty much the whole time as I was listening to a track every expectation I had for the next track was totally foiled and it was even difficult to predict where a certain song was going I like that element of surprise this thing has lush moments bleak moments piano ballads short tracks long tracks some conventional and others less so some fingerpick guitar and a Feist cover this thing pulls a lot of punches though it does it quietly however this kind of comes at a price because like I said earlier this album for me is a little formless and as I kind of dive into this album over and over and just try to make sense of it it only ends up becoming this bunch of pretty sounds organized with a philosophy I don't really understand quite yet and as long as we're griping some of the songs here to me don't really feel like songs per se more like motifs rough ideas meditations though very well produced James Blake obviously is not one for the traditional style of song structuring that's okay but considering all of the talent showcased here between the vocals melody writing the beat writing in the production some of these tracks are criminally short plus I think some of the background singing especially when you throw all that auto-tune in there it gets a little messy tangled unintelligible so I've pretty much described the album as best as I can if that doesn't sound like your cup of tea I would just say you know mosey on go on to the next album try the next thing don't let the fans or the people who will praise this album to death tell you that oh you just don't get it it's  there most definitely some memorable and amazing tracks here that are gonna be on my year-end list for 2011 but there were also a handful of underwhelming moments that stopped me just short of falling deeply deeply in love with this thing so I'm feeling like a strong 7 to a light 8 on it it's really enjoyable and filled with pretty pretty sounds for sure so what do you all think of this do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next but seriously what do you think of this thing Anthony Fantana James Blake forever [Music] 
k83AU5xksp0,cut copy so noscope holy crap hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd you guys remember my last video yesterday's video that sound you're hearing right now I you may remember I told couch you chest as a joke because I was making fun of him to go get a hot dog and he's now been making hot dogs for the past 13 hours straight now keep in mind Cal Chichester does not know how to cook he's just been slamming those doors all night I'm hoping they just come off the hinges eventually I'm just filming this video very early in the morning because I haven't gotten any sleep and I'm probably not going to be able to until the daytime when he gets tired so basically right now I'm just gonna try to it stopped it's thank you well we saw have to talk up this album a little bit don't want to leave you guys hanging so before I get into this there are a couple things on the needle drop calm that are worth noting I have a new writer someone who is helping me write for the website he's put up a couple articles a new Ruby cosa album a new track from dass racist both good posts both good pieces of music and check out your link in the d box alright let's get into this cut copy is an australian synth pop outfit and this is their third LP zona scoped now you guys may have seen me review the first single to drop from this LP where i'm going a while back and i was pretty surprised to see these guys take their electronic style and filter through this sunny retro pop sound but it's not like their previous LPS don't have a lot of variation on it the band's biggest LP in ghost colors has its Dancy air tracks it's rockier tracks acoustic moments and that ability to jump from style to style translates to this LP - in a pretty surprising way if there's one thing I have to commend this album on its Cut Copy with a lot of precision shape-shifts while making this album a cohesive listening experience the only place you could really pigeonhole these guys is the 80s and that's because the sounds of new wave run through this record pretty deep but that's probably something fans have already expected it's just a poppy dance sound with a lot of synthesizers backing it up that reminds me of a lot of stuff Fleetwood Mac was putting out in the 80s I'd go as far as to even say these guys are fans of men at work but even if you're not really a New Wave fanatic the dance grooves on this album should definitely get you going at least a little bit on tracks like Alisa take me over blink and you'll miss a revolution just the feel of those tracks the physicality of them translates to whatever decade you're in you know screw the whole retro thing because even though these guys borrow from the past they don't strike me as a band lost in their own sense of nostalgia Cut Copy puts a brave new face on this type of music that keeps them in league with their contemporaries like Holy Ghost or Miami horror or Chromeo or LCD soundsystem but I will admit I find all of those bands to have a lot more personality than Cut Copy so here come the gripes I do have a lot of issues with this album mostly with the vocals they just lack personality to me they lack definition sure this album is playful it's fun but pretty much this thing is unwilling to even dip one single toe into the experimental pool the one moment where I do feel like they're venturing out a bit the 15 minute song sun-god the track has a lot of thick layers a lot of sounds introducing themselves as the track evolves and builds and falls and just morphs and even Dan Whitford sounds like he's letting go of some of his inhibitions in his vocals getting a little more eccentric a little more out there and really laying some soul down on the track but still this thing is a nice listen for me it's like a straw five to a light six just kind of in one ear and out the other if you feel like y'all know that's just my opinion but if you're looking for a consistently simple and straightforward LP of dance pop with a strong retro flavor and pretty decent production as well I'd say go for it and before I wrap up this review I want to mention one more record if you're into this you may also be into this next album the LP reptilians by the organ band starpha this is also a third album and if I were to review this in its own separate video I would say roughly the same thing that I did here some flashes of great songwriting some nice grooves throughout but just lacks the experimentation and the personality to keep me engaged and interested just invested in the music so what do you think of these two LPS do you love them do you hate them why and what should I review next anthony Fantana cut copy starve forever 
Pj6SHbpDnSc,earth angels of darkness demons of light hi hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd time for an album review the new Earth LP angels of darkness and demons of light I have to say before I start this review the video card on my computer is not that hardcore so I may not be doing as many crazy insane edits for the next week until I knew more hardcore video card comes in the mail yes that's still a review I've been getting a ton of requests for this LP y'all know it I know it and for good reason this channel has definitely been somewhat of a safe haven for the music of Earth Sun just doom of the drone variety if you will and I've said in the past that definitely one of the LPS that has changed the way I listen to music has been earth to that thing maybe just made me realize the importance of drone music just loud Jeron music and to be simple about it this new LP is the stuff daydreams are made of just the perfect soundtrack to lying on your back in the middle of the desert and staring into the Sun the entire day you just better hope a scorpion doesn't come up in on your face this new LP is pretty much the style the band has been pursuing since their album Hex in 2005 this psychedelic slowed-down homage to tumbleweeds and showdowns at the okay Corral and with every release after hex these guys have been just getting a little bit less bleak to me they've been filling in these gaps just filling in the atmosphere with different sounds and they kind of perfected this idea to me on the LP bees made honey in the lion's skull with all of the piano sounds great improvisation from guest guitarist Bill Frisell and also just a really really shimmering the sphere around these instruments just amazing production but sadly for me this thing just does not live up to the expectations that I had set out for me because of honey but still even earth on an off day is a lot more adventurous and interesting than many bands out there I guess at the end of the day what's kind of killing my buzz on Angels of Darkness is that it doesn't feel like a development of this sound that Earth has been going for just more of a reiteration the most noticeable change between this LP and its predecessors is the addition of cello there's a lot of cello on this album it's not like a pit orchestra or anything like that just a couple extra layers of bowed instrumentation but the thing is they are mixed just to the point where I feel they're muddying up the sound a little bit just making the guitar the bass especially and to a lesser extent the drums stand out a little bit less and yeah you can most definitely zone out to this thing especially the 20-minute title track but what I like so much about bees is that you could zone out to that album but you could also dive in and actively explore and get enjoyment out of both hear the guitars feel like they evolved less the sound overall is less atmospheric less breathing room less spacious not anything that amazes me hmm but maybe you guys disagree let me know cow hey yeah he looks good in HD well what's HD hot dogs go get a hot dog oh I hate your gesture but I like this album I'm definitely feeling a light too decent seven on this I still get a lot of enjoyment out of it just crank it turn up the bass let it just I'm just gonna sit back let this numb out my head and just wait for part two to come along maybe I'll like that more who knows what do you all think maybe you disagree with me on this review I just don't feel like the cellos add that much magic to the mixture on this thing but let me know how you feel do you love this do you hate this why and what should I leave you next Anthony Fantana earth angels of darkness demons of light forever you 
qXl5h_2Fsz4,a list of white stripe songs I really like yes the wall isn't blue yes there's a zit on my face yes things are looking a little bit clearer we don't need to bring it up and freak out about it let's just have a good time hmmm alright let's do a quick little thing of this as y'all may know unfortunately the white stripes have broken up and as much as that saddens us let's not fret because their music lives on if you don't know the white stripes they're a Detroit duo who along with I want to say The Kills in the Black Keys of course there are a lot of bands influenced by this music as well but with the kills and the Black Keys played a very pivotal role in keeping the idea of blues and blues rock alive in just modern rock culture hmm let's just call it that and call it a day basically what I'm going to do in this video is just name off my 10 favorite white stripe songs just list them out list them out it's not a top-ten list I'm basically going to go from my favorites at the beginning of their career to the end of their career cool cool on this band's first album self-titled debut there are a lot of songs that I like Jimmy the exploder screwdriver or Astro but to me on that LP even though it is rough it's in the moment it's got a great attitude the covers are what stand out to me the most the songwriting here is not as great as it would later become on the LPS right after this one so I got to see my favorite track off of this and the first song to start off this list is their rendition of Robert Johnson's stop breaking down if you've never heard Robert or Johnson's song before I pity you check that guy out one of America's greatest blues men now on the band's next album which I've got to say is easily my favorite of theirs the songwriting got better the production got heavier more fantastic just a great sound and great tracks all around I gotta say one of my favorites from this thing is death letter Jack slide guitar and that thing is amazing well plus the lyrics are great I just love the sentiment of this track the story that it tells in the next song on this list from that album I gotta say is truth doesn't make a noise which I think is one of Jack's most heart-wrenching songs to date after that we've got white blood cells a lot of great tracks on there too a lot of acoustic tracks and I gotta say my favorites from that LP probably won't vary too far from what everybody else likes from that album fell in love with a girl Hotel Yorba we're going to be friends all great songs kind of entry level if that's all you like from the White Stripes but I got a say for as popular as those tracks are they are great and I enjoy them after that came the album elephant and like many of you I'm sure that was my first exposure to this band and immediately after I picked up that album loved the hell out of it I went backwards and heard all their other stuff and I got to say on that LP the standouts for me seven nation army easy easy ball and biscuit which is one of my favorite White Stripes tracks because it just shows Jack's just his ability to string a song out for a very long time and keep it engaging keep the guitar solos entertaining as hell and just really mmm create a jammy atmosphere and one more favor I'm going to add from that LP girl you have no faith in medicine oh man girl the dead minute and then to finish up this list I have to end it with a song that I love so much because I think it's so freakin hilarious not only is the guitar playing great I love the way that the drums back things up but just the sentiment of the track rag-and-bone just the lyrics you don't want this you know what is right we will take every time I hear Jack doing that voice I'm just thinking of it right now I just like want to laugh my ass off I just love the personality he lays down on that vocal um really just makes the White Stripes you know not just a serious group but they can make a track that is entertaining on multiple levels now I know that this list is going to raise some questions and I will answer some of those one yes I like that track but I like these tracks more than that track and yes that album is okay but I like these albums more than that album no I don't hate that song okay that track isn't on the list because I like these tracks more these 10 tracks why like Adele is a 10 track list I could only pick 10 well if I had to add an 11th track on here I guess it would probably be like I don't know like hello operator you know these are my 10 these are my 10 I don't hate that track I just like these more yes I've heard that one I've heard that one too that's just a random b-side that not a lot of people have heard it's it's alright okay it's just not what I think should be on because I like these more okay I like them more than that alright I like this I'm done I'll see you later do your over [Music] 
HMTBo9huzi0,Dumbo gets mad at the door hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd gonna do an album review I'm a little sick but being six not gonna stop me before we get started on the needle drop calm an audio review of that new kill single and also download a full mini LP from the band Brown Rekluse see a new music video from them and also listen to the new pains of Being Pure at heart track which is teasing toward their new LP coming out later this year excited and I'm sure y'all want me to review it soon maybe possibly in the future okay alright alright okay okay alright so this is the day I've been waiting for ever since a song a little song by the name of plumie tail came into my life sent to me by an Italian multi-instrumentalist who sounds like he records himself on a reel-to-reel machine with some fat bass cheesy synthesizers and a cheap guitar as you guys know plumie tail climbed up to number eight on my top 50 tracks of 2010 list and since then the project has released another song eclectic pron and this guy has somehow gotten his girlfriend involved in singing a handful of tunes on this album so now Dumbo gets mad is a duo they have an LP out titled elephants at the door and it's on bad panda records so what's going on here I'd like to think behind every track here there is a song verses choruses chords melodies but each one of these songs is padded out with pitch shifted falsetto vocals really odd effects strange sounds everything is piled onto these songs to the point where the songs get blurred you're no longer listening to a track but you're kind of on a Sonic Safari this guy even cites recent releases from ganja Sufi and Flying Lotus as influences for this album and considering all the experimentation it's not hard to see why this thing definitely has a modern adventurous attitude when it comes to sound but it takes tons of cues from 60s psychedelic rock but having said that it's kind of difficult to pinpoint one specific sound or delivery on this album each track kind of has its own thing going on many of you have already heard plumie tale but the track that follows right after is much more chilled out marmalade kits warm baseline analog synth chords in this drum beat this sounds like it could back up a hip-hop song from the 90s with all of these weird electronics flowing in the background of just phat phat sounds it totally reminded me of that new gorillaz record all you need is a member of De La Soul to come in and rap some verses in between the falsetto chorus vocals the mayhem continues on the track sleeping over the song opens up with the sound effect that you would normally hear in a flashback on a 70s cartoon show you get a groove going and then these pitch shifted vocals just jump in without warning the highest on the entire album this must be what listening to an Alvin and the Chipmunks record on acid is like also in this track you've got some sloppy saxophone some bubbles that kind of jump around the mix and these fluttering electronic blips it's basically the point of no return overall this thing is really indulgent even in its most accessible moments but for me it was worth it to kind of tough it out and listen through to hear the songs behind the mayhem because the sounds are so good it's a great listen on headphones because everything is panned really really hard like those sixties rock recordings where you know what you want to record eight instruments or you know just nine different things but you only have a four track so you have to get creative put the guitar put the drums in one track pan them all the way to the left to make a room for everything else in the center and on the right something like that this thing is easily some of the most creative production I've heard in a while and I'm not talking about shiny pretty production like the new Kanye West LP I'm talking about holy you did this by yourself you go girl kind of production I'm not trying to say I don't have complaints about this LP I definitely do these songs are so just packed tightly with everything but the kitchen sink listening to them one after the other after the other is a little bit like running it's a feeling I get when I listen to other albums that I like that really really demand my attention because there's so much subtlety there are so many things flying by you don't want to miss them like grizzly bears yellow house or any album written by the band ruins my only other gripes are that harmony and eclectic pron kind of sound alike only that harmony is a little bit slower plus I was having kind of an issue when listening to this album on the hi-fi at first because the thing is it sounded so cuca finis the keyboards and the bass were really overpowering and like ruining a lot of these tracks for me but then I realized Oh duh tape recordings lend a lot of low end to the mix turn down the bass everything was peachy clear as a bell some of these tracks are gonna jump out as being catchy instantly but others are gonna need to be flipped over looked at closely analyzed like a Rubik's Cube so if you like your rock music experimental psychedelic sound rich and out there and free I encourage you to check out this new Dumbo gets mad album elephants at the door I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this yeah some gripes but overall I really enjoyed it and honestly I'm really happy that the album panned out I was really hesitant to enjoy this at first because I just thought oh man I love plumie tales so much I hope the album can just like live up to the awesomeness of that track and I'm just happy to say that for the most part it did but what's most important to me now is I want to know what you guys think about this album do you love it do you hate it why favorite song least favorite song is it too experimental not experimental enough is it too psychedelic is it too weird let me know and also what should I review next anthony Fantana Dumbo gets mad 
kLFGEHpPi3w,good John Vanderslice white wilderness hey everybody Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and we're going to embark upon an album review so batten up the hatches and hop upon hop on board and I hate boats before we get into this review on the needle drop comm right now there's a track review of a song from the new tile live quali album gutter rainbows and download the entire new Dumbo gets mad album yes it is out digitally mm-hmm so now that that LP is out I think you all know what tomorrow's review is going to be wink wink wink but first let's discuss this John Vanderslice is a Florida singer-songwriter and this is his new LP white wilderness and it features the magic magic orchestra which is a California collective of classically trained musicians led by director Meena choy and this thing is definitely a change of pace for John especially when you compare to his last album which had good songs on it but really didn't have any kind of sounds or production tricks that you wouldn't expect on a singer-songwriter LP what makes white wilderness interesting with the addition of the orchestra is that it was recorded live and sounds like it is virtually devoid of any and all post-production so when you hear the strings swelling underneath John's voice it's happening right then right there and it's really added this great in the moment feel to the album more often than not when a lot of arrangements are added to a song added to an LP it sort of tends to choke off the emotion of the track maybe get between the singer and the listener but I wouldn't say that's the case here more often than not the magic magic Orchestra actually adds a new level of emotion and interaction to these songs though I will admit one of the best songs here after it ends features no extra instrumentation whatsoever but this thing is pretty much just piano acoustic guitar woodwinds brass strings percussion just a nice piece of modern Baroque pop but despite the beauty of the instrumentation and some of the affecting images that John pulls together in his lyrics like the Gaza Strip or latchkey kids or glass-bottom boats I just don't find these songwriting as interesting as I do the instrumentation when John loses my attention I pretty much just gravitate toward whatever's going on in the arrangements which I would say is a bad thing if the arrangements weren't so dang good plus if somebody were to come up to me and say Anthony this is unoriginal this is run-of-the-mill I wouldn't argue the thing is we've heard this setup before we've been here this is definitely new territory for John Vanderslice and territory his fans will probably love to hear him go in but when we're talking about the bigger picture of things what this album may sound like to an outsider this LP may come up like a less epic less dynamic version of some of Sufjan Stevens more praised albums but overall I'm liking it it's just over 30 minutes it does not overstay its welcome it's full of intricate and beautiful acoustic instrumentation and has a really vibrant live execution still overall this album is just kind of a crush for me not loving it liking it crushing on it like ooh that album is hot but I'm still walking the other direction right now I'm like a strong six on this but what do you guys think about this album is this a shocking change of pace for John Vanderslice is a mammoth of a singer-songwriter album and what do you think about arrangements surrounding songs what does adding a ton of strings piano horns woodwinds actually do to a track help it or hurt it in your opinion Anthony Fantana John Vanderslice and the magic magic Orchestra white wilderness forever you 
uWzNiXXypE0,it's track review hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd its track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion now many of you all may already know this past weekend I put out a list of my most anticipated LPS of 2011 and I have two additions to that list on the needle drop calm right now you can download an mp3 from the upcoming Vivian girls LP they've got an album scheduled looking forward to that and also who announced an album Fleet Foxes what are you doing oh I am just gonna add the radio heads in that tool and the red pepper cuz you you forgot that oh okay well Ellie while I was wrestling to put up my breeds review because YouTube was giving me a little bit of a hard time for Fleet Foxes dropped an album release date and a new song from their forthcoming sophomore LP helplessness blues this LP is set for release in the beginning of May on Sub Pop Records let's give a listen and see what this track this title track has to offer alright when performed correctly simplicity can have a ton of power simplicity can be a powerhouse remember that and Robyn Peck Knowles folky voice and the strum guitar at the beginning of this song are an example of that for sure when I was hearing just just that introduction the sound hit me like I was listening to something from the 60s Fulk revival but with very crisp lush 2011 production and though I wouldn't say the lyrics espouse a certain political ideology or talk about a certain political movement they are very socially conscious or at least conscious of the self or the role one plays in the world I guess their words here about coming to terms with individuality are you an individual are you unlike anybody else or would you rather conform because we all know that being different that doing something different than everybody else doesn't necessarily get you complements all the time so some of the lyrics here toy with the idea of being a cog in a machine or just running down the track life has set out for you and there's a moment here where he mentions an army determining his future for him I don't know if that's he's under threat of being killed or something that for me was a little vague but the song just gets bigger and bigger with these gargantuan guitar strums and harmonized vocals and the story gets more in-depth to as that progression happens I get the feeling from the words at this point in the song that the world to Robin or maybe just the character he's singing as looms large it's a scary place it's a scary place to go out into the world and just be an individual and not conform but what use is it to sing helplessness blues there's an instrumental break a lot of fantastic acoustic strings played throughout this section with electric guitar swelling just being really really dramatic I love this part of the song and then after that the story seems to change a little bit talking about more of an honest life a life where he does actually maybe serve a purpose in the world where he's working on an orchard fronting a store something like that and then the song ends maybe fizzles out a little bit with him talking about some day he'll be the man on the screen and I don't know if that is the ambition that was in the beginning of the song maybe kind of coming out over here at the end of the song will these dreams be realized are these dreams just going to sit there in the person's head it's a really epic song great melodies great lyrics great production it just works on so many levels to be honest and because of that I'm freaking stoked for this album I'm feeling like a strong eight on this as of this moment right here so yeah I hope you guys are doing it as well a Fleet Foxes helplessness Blues what do you guys expect of this upcoming LP big things little things and also what should I review next anthony Fantana Fleet Foxes helplessness blues forever yeah yeah I remember when I had 100 subs to 
mYez03fRUBs,breathes native-speaker hmm hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's album review time before we get started this past weekend I put up a video of my 16 most anticipated albums of the year are they the only albums I'm anticipating no but they're the ones I am anticipating most linked in the D box to find that and also I've done an audio review of that new self-titled Cloud Nothings album you can find that on the blog linked below as well and also make sure to follow us on Facebook and on Twitter it's where we announce contests put up new posts from the blog put up weird general funny musings onto the review let's talk up a release that's been getting a lot of buzz a Canadian quartet by the name of breeds LP native speaker this is the band's first release since changing their name from the neighborhood council good move and the band's music has gotten a lot more refined since that name change on their set-pieces EP the group would go out on these long adventurous linear jams that really kind of remind me of funk music in that they just grab hold of a groove and they don't let go but the mix was kind of muddy and the production wasn't exactly all that good a definite flaw but this time around the band is just shinier there a lot shinier and they're using a lot of electronics to get their point across I don't want to say this is a lush album it didn't have colors rushing to my head but there are a lot of points here were braid sounds really pretty the title track is definitely one of those moments with these really mesmerizing dreamy synthesizers that just shimmer with in the mix along with these cycling tonal hums just repeating in the background making it seem kind of just repetitive minimal but in a good way you could tell that the sound is shifting but these changes are happening so subtly add a lot of points of this LP it's hard to tell where exactly you're going or when it's happening it's like the rug is being pulled out right from under your feet listening to this album is kind of like sitting in an echo chamber while listening to music not reverb it's not like you know you get this big gargantuan sound with braids that's not what you get what I'm talking about is when you hear sound when you hear a note when you hear something happen it bounces and you hear repeat three or four more times now having said I like this band sound there is something about it that has gotten them a lot a lot of comparisons to Animal Collective and I can certainly see why there is something about the looping and the trippy electronics and the vocal effects that is pretty Merriweather Post Pavilion but this feeling only really hits me on the first track of this album lemonade as I trip through native speaker I catch whiffs of ambient music and parts I would even compare to Julianna barwick or even Glasser but overall I love the really long sprawling song lengths here there are only seven tracks but this thing tops 40 minutes so you do get some really wide and open spaces on this thing this LP did just kind of stopped short of impressing me 100% though the drums I felt I could have had a lot more punch to them and the vocals for me are a little more eccentric than they are melodic plus I think there was a little bit of a mixing issue here with them as well they're either so quiet it's difficult to actually hear kind of what's going on or what is being said or they're shrieking ly loud and just really not adding as much as they are taking away from the track maybe some compression could have helped the volume differences I don't know so those parts have me kind of holding back on this LP despite the fact that I do like a lot of parts about it Cal what do you think of braids but what it breeds matter to me where are you we're bald always with the right thing to say couch your chest I'm like a light too decent 7 on this thing it's a debut album it feels like a debut album however part of me says that it's definitely going to get better from here I'm just gonna say braids is a band to watch call it a day and ask what do you think about this album all the people who have been asking me about this what do you feel about this LP loving it what are you loving about it why and what album should I review next anthony Fantana braids forever you 
xYl998XwMng,anticipation albums I'm anticipating hi everybody Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music no no we're not doing a review today we're not doing a question of the week we're going to do something that I hope to get done at least once a month a list a list of something not necessarily a top ten list or you know the best of this the best of that but just a list of things I recommend to y'all now with January kind of coming to a close we've already talked about a lot of great albums spread the word about some good good good music but we have 11 more months to go of this year and there are a lot of albums in those 11 months that I am highly highly anticipating and this is that list my anticipated albums of really really anticipated albums of 2011 let's start with an album I'm really looking forward to the release of MOG wise hardcore will never die but you will if you've seen my track review of the song Rando piano on that album you'll know that I'm excited after that it's the new DeVotchKa LP 100 lovers I haven't heard from these guys in a while I thought their last album was okay but I'm looking forward to them to kind of make a comeback this time around and maybe put out something really awesome 3 it's the rural Alberta advantage with the album departing and I reviewed a track from that thing they came out with a really great music video recently and I've interviewed them for the website noise box org it's gonna be a new album for Saddle Creek Records really enjoying what I'm hearing so far and I think it's gonna be just a good straight forward Rock slash pop record at number four I'm really looking forward to hearing the new Strokes album I'm kind of excited to hear those guys get back together and at number six a band that I really like fronted by Jeremy Barnes and Heather trust a hawk and a hacksaw with servin teen hoping I'm pronouncing that correctly those guys play a really distinct style of Balkan music of Eastern European music they just really embrace that sound with a lot of sincerity and I've enjoyed every record they put out so far and number seven if you've seen my track review I'm really look forward of that new Mountain Goats LP all Eternals Dec and another album I did track review from James Blake self-titled album Holy Ghost has an LP coming out as does Krystal stilts and you guys are asking for it I've been kind of silent on the matter but I am looking very very very forward to this Earth's Angels of Darkness and demons of light and apparently this may be a two-parter right here get one album and another album later this year next year I'm not completely sure on that info at the moment I'm also looking forward to the new Burzum record fallin it can only get better from Bellis in my opinion and you guys know I'm really looking forward to that new Dumbo gets mad LP elephants at the door I've been listening to it but still excited for the release of it excited to see your reactions to this album we have a new times new Viking LP on the way the self-titled debut from a new Fat Possum band yuck and I'm most definitely definitely looking forward to the new explosions in the sky album take care take care take care and finally let's end this list with panda bears tomboy I really haven't enjoyed many of the singles from this album so far but I do want to know what it sounds like I want to see panda bear maybe outdo person pitch and see if he can actually make a solo project that maybe shadows over Animal Collective stuff I don't see that happening maybe I think it's gonna be an album pretty much just for the fans something that's not going to appeal outside of the animal collective camp but could still really be worth listening to those are my most anticipated albums of this year there also should be an album from the pains of Being Pure at heart dr. dre and a collaborative LP from what I'm hearing between Ghostface Killah and doom but those don't have album titles or release dates or really any information on them yet but a lot of things to look forward to this year could be a big year in music better than 2010 hoping so tell me what albums you're looking forward to and have a nice day Anthony Fantana the needle drop forever 
kp-3jPaY7yU,Belair talk okay okay okay all right all right okay all right okay okay all right okay Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd we have a good metal album to review right now before I get into this we have a new song from the band Dumbo gets mad premiered and streaming on the needle drop dot-com I know a lot of you guys are excited for this album it's going to drop February 22nd that's the album art it's weird go check it out link down there in the D box alright so this past week I went on one of my favorite websites it's been linked in the blog roll of my blog for a while I don't know how long um metal sucks dot net and I saw that they had blogged about me and that was exciting until I found that they blogged about me negatively and it was on my I saw Sun video and I could totally understand if that's your first introduction to me then yeah you could pretty much assume me to be a big thin dork but I'm not an idiot I saw that the post on the site had been written by sergeant Dee who to me is kind of like the staff troll of the website and if he's not making fun of me he would probably be making fun of somebody else if I didn't have thick skin I would not upload video logs of myself almost every day going back about my favorite albums so this situation has made me want to kill two birds with one stone talk about one of my favorite records of last year and extend the hand of bro ship to metal sucks net I know the guys Vincent axle who are the heads of the website our good writers have good taste and if they think I'm a loser after this video I'm still going to go on their website so why am i reviewing this album from last year especially since I like to keep you guys up to date on what is new well basically it's because I did enjoy this but this LP got released just about everywhere but the US but according to this band's Facebook age this LP will be getting released in March of this year over here their name is Keller tock there are Norwegian band this is their self-titled album and this thing is a gift from the Nordic gods it's intense it's heavy its aggressive but there's not one spot of difficulty on this album for me being from where they are Keller talks music sends a lot of signals showing an influence coming out of the black metal realm from the blast beats on the drums the tremolo Pickett ARS and especially the lead vocals but there's a lot more going on here than that the hard driving force of punk music definitely powers this album especially in the hard pumping chords and there's a lot of classic rock and rock and roll sounds that show up on this thing too especially on the track sultans of satan we're without warning the band just breaks into these guitar riffs that sound straight out of the Jimi Hendrix playbook on the song foxy lady and they then transition that into jeez this drum brake with cowbell that builds a lot like a CD C's TNT basically even though these guys are not a sludge band or a doom band by any means you're going to pick up the sounds you may already be familiar with on records from torch all pigs must die Baroness and speaking of Baroness John Beasley of that band actually that the cover art for this this thing is built mostly out of distorted guitars warm bass really sharp drums but the band breaks up the instrumentation here and there with these keyboards acoustic guitars and these harmonized Viking vocals that give this sense of epicness to a lot of these tracks and though these guys are a really loud band and they stay loud for a majority of the time on this record the sound never wears its welcome because these guys break these harsher moments up with drum fills melodic guitar leads and solos build ups pauses because playing as hard and as fast as you possibly can with no interruptions for five minutes straight is king boring now some people may say this is just pop metal and I will agree that there are more difficult groups out there that there are more challenging records that have been released that are just as much worth your time as this is but if there's anything that makes this easy to listen to it's not that Belair talk are a band of lightweights or anything like that or they just go easy on you the reason this is easy to listen to boils down to good songwriting contrast righteous melodies tension the only other issue I could see what this album is that it blends so many ideas together it's hard to say Oh black metal fans will like this because yeah sure that's an influence here but it's not exactly a black metal album simply put and that goes for every other stylistic influence on this thing let me know what you guys think of this album do you love it do you hate it why it's streaming all over YouTube on MySpace as well I believe thank you very much for watching this video Anthony Fantana Belair talk forever [Music] you [Music] when the needle drop calm there's a tiny little itty-bitty baby baby baby

WhC9kcctI8s,why why is it snowing again why why why hey everybody Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and we're going to do a review of the new December selfie the king is dead before I get into this review I want to say a couple things on the needle drop calm download some new mp3s one from Tim Heidecker in davon wood of Tim and Eric awesome show great job apparently they're coming out with a collaborative album this year and also a new track from Holy Ghost it's actually a track and a track review it's really freaking good the track is good now the track review the track review is good too but not as good as the track and yes this review is late and it's because you know I've just been avoiding it a little bit like the plague but I'm not some Decemberists hater or something like that I loved what these guys were doing back in the day on the Kill Rock Stars label and was even able to follow them on some of the dancey or indie pop sounds that they performed on the crane wife and I assumed the band would just get more bland from that point on but I was very very wrong because then they dropped hazards of love which is obviously their most ambitious record to date it turned some fans off maybe it wasn't the most accessible of all of their albums it's kind of hard to enjoy any one song out of the context of that LP but I like seeing a band just go for the gold however on this new LP The Decemberists do not attempt to grasp the brass ring or anything like that I'm not sure what they're trying to grasp colin Meloy is kind of nasally very eccentric vocal style and the really dramatic romanticized storytelling on tracks like sixteen military wives or Mariners revenge song or red right ankle these are the things that have made this band's music captivating to me in the past and I wouldn't say they're 100% gone definitely not but they have been toned down I don't think the band forgot how to do these things I mean the move is obviously intentional it just may not necessarily be a move that I wanna form and there's also a huge country and folk influence here which isn't bad I actually liked country music quite a bit and this record kind of makes me feel like The Decemberists are going back a little bit to their roots when they used to be a much more acoustic band but the sound of this record the feel the recording the the the processed production this thing sounds like to me in my opinion if I clicked on the TV and started watching CMT the references to Celtic music kind of feel just as plastic the production I can deal with at times but something I just cannot handle on this album at all something that just chills me to the bone are the solos the harmonica the fiddle the piano the pedal steel all of the solos here on this album and you know there are quite a bit of them are performed so mundane ly it's like they're acknowledging they're meant to be nothing more than filler to break up the verses sure hazards of love had some mixed reviews but still to me the instrumentation there was so much more ambitious so much more exciting but nothing on this LP excites me honestly I've gone to Six Flags and I'm riding the teacups I'm not feeling it but I could definitely see other people liking this I mean being straightforward being simple that's not a bad thing I don't like my music challenging all the time either I did like that new kake album for example but for me this thing lacks attitude almost completely in the vocals and the instrumentation pretty much every track here fits into a pop structure and that's fine too but these songs are so plainly built and put together by the first thirty Seconds I could tell what the next 150 seconds are going to be there are some parts I like though like the June and January hymns which are very much understood surprising I like these because I feel underwhelmed by this album but I think the thing is with all the blaring acoustic instrumentation and the booming drums on the other tracks I feel as if Colin's personality or kind of what's left of it here and the songwriting get a chance to shine out when it's not being drowned out so overall you know I hate to do this but I'm just feeling like a light four on album a strong hold on one second very Anthony this album is at least worth is seven or an eight or a ten yeah maybe it's that score to you but that is your point of view that's your opinion you understand this is opinion right that we're not going to come to some kind of objective answer as to whether or not this album is good by discussing it yeah will you just because I don't like the album doesn't mean I don't like the band or think you're wrong for enjoying this the score is not like a grade you get on a math test it's merely a reflection of my emotions on the LP well you should really review more classic albums and you should realize what the point of this channel is to open you up to new music that you may not necessarily know about or just discuss new records and if I just go into the past and start randomly picking up critically acclaimed records and just saying they're good because everyone likes them I'm not doing my job as a reviewer to help make the music of today that is coming out right now classic it's my duty as an arbiter of taste to help out the present-day musical economy by telling you what albums I feel are worth your time and worth your money we can disagree on this and that's healthy and that's fine just as long as we realize our points of view are subjective I may write a book one day about some of my favorite albums of all time or a book series or something like that but there's just not a lot of challenge in reviewing albums that are critically acclaimed I like them you like them what is there to say well you should at least review the new iron in wine you're right I should most definitely the new iron and wine LP kiss each other clean I kind of see Sam bean here as spreading his wings out on this one Sam is soft and nice and pleasant just like he usually is but he's doing it with a slightly higher volume some different production styles and genres too now Shepherds dog saw the introduction of a lot of different instrumentation into the iron and wine Canon but the thing is here I feel like this album borders on drowning out that intimate connection between am and the listener which has always attracted me to this guy as a songwriter standing back just to take in this full band this full group of instruments that he wants me to listen to I just have kind of lost a little bit of a connection I guess but still Sam has maintained a lot of songwriting strength as he has gotten louder maybe if he experiments with this a little bit more he'll find a voice that stands out among all this backup so overall it's pretty likeable just kind of a passing fancy for me nothing that stopped me in my tracks overall what would you score it maybe maybe it's like a six or something no wait uh uh subjective opinion remember I guess I forgot you know what I mean to say is a I really do like that album though I think that the extra sangs the extra sounds makes it really fun to listen to I guess I was being a pretty big melon there wasn't I I'd say you were more like a banana hahaha I had no idea there was so much humor in the four basic food groups I know I guess you could say it's ripe for the pickin hey everybody thanks for watching we had a lot of fun a lot of laughs a lot of love and a lot of lulz have a nice day forever you 
2IWjwiuBG4A,every day every day destroyer hey how you doing Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd thank you for being awesome thank you for clicking on to this review I really appreciate it alright before we talk about this I need to mention one thing I interviewed two cool guys two cool guys yesterday by the name of Tom and Jake they run a YouTube channel by the name of velocities in music they do a lot of regular music reviews they've got in my opinion great personalities a great perception of what they're doing just good taste they're not me they're a good alternative to me so go check them out link over here link over there links everywhere the interview you can hear it in full on the needle drop dot-com so let's get into this because you're talking about it I want to review it because I'm a fan of destroyer this band project whatever is fronted by singer/songwriter Dan Behar in between this his roles in Swan Lake the New Pornographers band's discography is getting to the point where it's a little intimidating for people who are new to destroy you're like oh where do where do I start I would recommend Street Hawk a seduction destroyers rubies this night between these three LPS dan Behar tips his hat to Foulke music chamber pop really flamboyant glam rock the kind of stuff that just gets you compared to Scott Walker and David Bowie just to name a few and Dan has built himself to be one of these songwriting personalities who sticks to his guns just does what he knows with very small variations in between each album but that is all changed here on caput destroyer did tease to this sound with two EPs Bay of Pigs Archer on the beach but still I was not at all prepared for what this had in store for me basically kaput is built of a bunch of 80s light rock hits backed with watery guitars disco beats and bass lines and sexy smooth jazz sax solos and I know that doesn't sound all that appealing in fact there is so much corn and cheese throughout this LP it may make some listeners sick to their stomach the only thing that has not changed much on this album is Dan's personality and vocal delivery I would say because he doesn't so much sing as he does act out his really eccentric lyrics about cocaine America being an old soul in the music scene whenever I hear Dan talking or singing in his music I just think of him making these really wide sweeping hand gestures that just emphasize every word that he's saying it's kind of what keeps me coming back for more so yeah there's this embrace of the 80s here Dan's persona is stronger than ever and yet I could see this still turning a lot of people off this thing maybe cast it off as novelty because of its style and a lot of people really aren't into the whole rock poet thing but I don't feel that way the thing is every reason that I've listed other people may not like this album I like this album for thing that's kind of a popular sound right now to just go back to the past just mine old styles but there's more here than just an old style melody songwriting musicianship all hold equal importance there's a balance most definitely there are just a lot of straight-up pop tunes here there are several moments where destroyer experiments with longer songs with ambient interludes and intros and even then my attention is kept by just a really great sound and atmosphere I love the synths I love the horns I just love the production that these songs are wrapped up in this thing is really sexy vibe I'm loving the lyrics I'm loving the personality of it feeling a light 9 on this thing yeah of course going on the loved list my first nine of 2011 definitely going to be remembered when this time comes at the end of 2011 and that's pretty much all I got to say short and simple into the point guys I mean that's just how I feel about the album but what do you think do you like this do you hate it and why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana destroy your kaput [Music] 
Y5Dy3MxEyTY,bicycles hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's most evil music nerd and it's time for an album review so let's not around Deerhoof has been a band a lot longer than they've been a popular band and even though they've been together for over 15 years they're never painted as this seasoned indie heavy weight because 2007 was when deer have actually started turning heads even though I think they were writing pretty interesting stuff before that these guys are extremely idiosyncratic very very odd I promise you one of the most definitive bands you will come across when he dear Huff song plays you know it is a Deerhoof song their sound is just the sum of all these different pieces hard-hitting but intricate drums rough guitars weird melodies interludes of dissonant noise every once in a while and of course Satomi's just paper-thin voice and this band has been really uncompromising in their style never giving in to the temptation to do something a little more normal not to say the Deerhoof isn't catchy or captivating or enjoyable they are it's just that they they do spit in the face of a lot of musical conventions do you need a repeating verse and chorus does a song need to tell a story does it need to make sense does it need to have a point do you need to stick to one genre one time signature one language one singer no that's been this band's answer in the past and that's still this band's answer on their 10th album Deerhoof versus evil this thing is a follow-up to 2008 offend Maggie which was a really loud record just bombastic guitars that hit your eardrums like a cheese grater that album did kind of rock the out I'll give it that but in getting louder and getting more aggressive more in-your-face the band's dynamics suffered a little bit vs. doesn't rock is hard but it's not flaccid it balances things out with other sounds the opener has these heavily layered guitars matched up against really busy percussion it's a little disorienting but in a good way it makes me think of the sound a toy box a giant toy box might make if you just shook it really hard secret mobilization has like this classic rock strut that just makes me think like Deerhoof vs. Steppenwolf as opposed to Dieruff versus evil super duper rescue head's features these atmospheric electronics in the background and cute lyrics about saving someone and never being alone it's like it's like listening to a hug but for me a real standout on this LP is no one asked to dance which is kind of funny because it's it's like the the quietest song here just fluttering Spanish guitar very pretty very moving and I'd love to point this track out to anybody who says oh so Tomi can't sing she has a crappy voice I don't understand that her voice maybe is a little bit of an acquired taste but she's totally on pitch here and on this song she sounds like a beautiful little bird I was definitely moved by this track it struck me as just being really really pretty but seriously I could go on about every track here I'm not bullshitting when I say I feel every song has at least a little bit of something special about it if I had to complain about this record though it would probably be with the song lengths a lot of these tracks just kind of stop or peter out with little or no warning I feel almost as if Deerhoof could have made at least a few of these tracks twice as long if there are any other gripes I have on this LP that introductory bassline on the Mary barracks is just really weird maybe a little too weird for me I'm just trying to maybe get used to that and the last track is I just not all that memorable but overall this thing is short sweet playful the same qualities that have made deer Huff's past work enjoyable and fantastic so how am I feeling on this thing I think at the end of the day I'm going to have to say dear Huff 1 1 Deerhoof one one no like deer hoof one evil lost you like thought I meant like one like a one yeah that's how I call the match it's deer who versus evil deer hoof one what do you want me to say I mean that's it even though I would say this band is a little short of breath on this album evil didn't stand a chance that's definitely evil is down for the count evil got pwned but what do you think about this album do you love it do you hate it why is the band Deerhoof too weird for you are they too normal and also what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana deer hoof versus evil forever 
XtmTM3AIdLI,Furguson Geronimo hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internets busiest music nerd and welcome to the album review for the new Ferguson Geronimo LP unlearned now if you guys are in the mood for some double review action and want to hear an audio review you can also head to the needle drop calm link in the d box and hear a review of a track from the new Krantz album do you team up do too MA Taman now here's a question do you like fun of course you don't because if you did you would already know about this new Ferguson Geronimo LP this album has been pretty anticipated for me just because these guys put out one of my favorite singles of last year turning blue which was the b-side of the never satisfied 7-inch but I have to admit I wasn't a big fan of this album the first time I listened through it I guess you could say I kind of fell prey of expecting the sound from the 7-inch to kind of translate to this and not to say that there is a loss of quality here that's not what I'm trying to argue I guess what I'm saying is that I expected the sound of those two songs to just be like this just 11 or 10 more songs that sound like that you know you know you know what I'm saying a little bit of a post-punk influence on turning blue on that single which I kind of thought that was gonna be on unlearn but instead Ferguson Geronimo they still wear their influences on their sleeve and here they jump from sound to sound to sound one minute they're playing a really strange goofy Frank Zappa Eskimo town and do op track and the next minute they're kind of screaming in your face with a little bit of garage rock philosophy with things don't always go the way you want them to with a voice that kind of sounds like the late j retards some subjects seem to jump around from idea to idea to idea to there are tracks on here about girls with English accents a big swing at the music distri with wanna know what I would do and Baby Boomers and that's pretty much all I could figure out just from the song titles even though the production here is pretty rough around the edges and these guys are not refined very much in terms of songwriting the tracks here are pretty short there's something about the personality of this album that's drawing me in something that I don't know is maybe akin to Adam greens album even though these guys jump from song subject to song subject to sound to sound they're always pretty funny witty clever however you want to describe it mmm it's an LP I enjoyed a lot more after it was over not to say that I was glad that it was over but after the last song ends you then kind of get the perspective and you see how these guys can shape-shift and how many different sounds and just moods these guys can emulate with just not even batting an eye because the truth is they do it all pretty well Plus getting through that first listen isn't all that hard because this thing is only 29 minutes long overall I think it's a great debut album although I read in an interview on 130 bpm I will link that in the d box that these guys may not be writing music anymore or maybe just for a while and they're going to embark on different projects I'm not exactly sure vague the future is fuzzy I'm feeling a light eight on this though it is really short I'm just enjoying it for its fun attitude just its quirkiness and I think you guys made it for the same reasons going to add it to the love list when I get a chance and of course you can hear several tracks from it on the needle drop calm okay keep being awesome Anthony Fantana Ferguson Geronimo what should I review next forever 
YTJ2dzQhSrM,white lies ritual hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd its album review time oh yes it is but before I get into that want to mention needle drop com there's a new split single featuring the band women new track from them many of you may remember that I loved their LP public's train last year was high high high up there on my favorite albums of 2010 list and also for all the tennis fans out there in case you didn't see also there's a audio podcast review thing up there on the website as well of the title track from Tennessee's new LP Cape Dori so I've received a ton of requests to review this new White Lies LP ritual and if a review is what you want a review is what you are going to get white lies is an English post-punk trio who have kind of been lumped into the revivalist set of the genre with bands like editors Interpol you know that crowd back during the project's inception they used to be under the name fear of flying but this is the second LP under their current name and let's try to describe it shall we as I said these guys have been lumped into post-punk but the thing is that term is so vast and so wide though I do enjoy post-punk music a lot of bands label this post-punk it's almost useless as a genre label because it includes everything from wire to Gang of Four to Siouxsie and the Banshees and I see a lot of differences between those bands but white lies doesn't emulate any of those bands instead they kind of copy I'm gonna use that word very lightly here the dark moody synth backed rock sound manifested on albums like Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures and revived on Interpol's turn on the bright lights in fact they emulate this sound so closely the synth melody on the track streetlights almost sounds exactly like that on love will tear us apart except like backwards the timbre of the synth is almost the same - it's weird so after they figured out the sound they decide they're gonna take it to Las Vegas dress it up make it sound really expensive suck all of the experimentation and adventure and exploration out of it and then just act like everything is hunky-dory but it's not hunky-dory it's more where are the risks that this music was taking back in 1977 because I don't hear them here they're just not here they're non-existent it's basically post-punk for the adult contemporary set it's hard for me not to see it as post-punk for moms I'm sorry I said the wrong thing I didn't you know what I'm saying at this point it's like you know if you have a mom she'll probably like this I apologize I wasn't using my head I messed up there's nothing offensively bad between the start of the first track and the end of the last track on this album but my problem is that there's nothing all that memorable either white lies first album wasn't all that risky but at least the tunes were a bit catchy or all the cleanliness is basically taken away what little humanity this band had on their first LP for me and I know a lot of people have been complaining about this who are fans of the band though it doesn't really bother me the guitars aren't really as loud on this thing as they were with earlier tracks there are a lot more synthesizers here for sure overall I'm feeling like a strong four to a light five on this album it just it just kind of bored me that's all I'm saying that's pretty much my position on it you guys who've been screaming and yelling for me to review this album I want to know what you like about it let me know in the comments am i a flaming idiot am I totally wrong is this the upset of the century that I don't like this album that much and think that maybe other people will like it more than me it's just not my thing or am I kind of in the right here which I don't really see because this is all just opinion anthony Fantana white lies ritual forever don't worry about me man when I'm bored of this I'll just stop okay see you later
